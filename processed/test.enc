Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
You know Chastity?
do you listen to this crap?
What crap?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Queen Harry?
Hi, Joey.
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
In 9th.  For a month
He was, like, a total babe
But she doesn't want to date.
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
Wear the belly before you go.
Daddy, no!
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
Will Bogey get bent?
Number one.  She hates smokers
The hell is that?  What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
What've you got for me?
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
Leave my sister alone.
Are you lost?
You and Verona?
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
William would never have gone to a state school.
You think this'll work?
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
Who?
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
You -- covered in my vomit.
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
You don't care if I die
I hate him.
Kat! Wake up!
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
You're sweet.  And sexy.  And completely hot for me.
No.
Bianca did what?
Right.
What plan?
What?!
Ever been to Club Skunk?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
Sweet love, renew thy force!
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Would you rather be ravished by a pirate or a British rear admiral?
I never seen heat like this!  Not even in Las Minas!
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
I know.
She said yes.
What is it, now?  Tell me...
Forgive me, Don Bobadilla -- those positions have already been taken.
I have to explore the mainland.
No?
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Chief says -- how many?
To bring the word of God.
How did you manage it?
All of them!  Just lies!
I lied.  The journey will be longer than I said.
New worlds create new people.
There is one thing I'd like to understand... Why do you want to go back, after all this?
We lost cousins, friends.  We will wash this in blood.
Due west, Captain Mendez.  And may God be with us...
We have to keep the hopes of these men alive!
Jesus Maria!  I should have never listened to you!
You bloody...
I'm not your lawyer until I see the money.
Don't say anything.
I was all of these.
What about Oleg?
I will if they don't send me back.
I know.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Do you have coffee?
Oh.
Oh yeah...?  Alright.
Hey, Chief, what are you doing here?
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Yeah, right.
I said, yeah, you're right, Chief.  As soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
Alright.  Swing by her apartment.  Let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to Hoover Street.  You got that?
When?
Yeah.
He got my gun!  Motherfucker was filming the whole time!
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
We don't have her I.D. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the King Edward Hotel.
Hmmmm.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
I'll come with you.
You're Polish?
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
I'm serious here.
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously.
Alright.
Stop it.
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was...
No.  Tell me what you want to say.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
Where is escort service?
Two weeks.
Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech?
Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision.
Oh, shit.  I hate looking at that!
Sit down!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit.
I can get you a job.
Yes, the money is good.
That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage.
So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
That's what it looks like to me.
No way!  He's mine!
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
Oh yeah, why?
Clean?
Your doctor?
But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
What's up?
Yes.
Well, what do you think we ought to do about it?
I know. It would be almost inconceivable.
Well, that's something.
I guess you don't know your own strength, old boy.
I'm sorry, Frank, but I don't think I can answer that question without knowing everything that all of you know.
Not now, Hal, I'd like to talk to you about something.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Yes, it is.
I'm goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have the control, please.
I am prepared to do that anyway.
Are you coming to my party?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
How is gregor?
No, thank you... and I'm afraid now I really must be going.
Well, shall we go through Documentation?
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
That's right.
Certainly.
Any clue as to what it is?
When do we arrive at Clavius?
What do you mean?
No, of course, Captain, I can understand your concern.
Five by five, Frank.
This is three years old.
We don't wash 'em, ya know.
It's better when you pay... they let you do anything.
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
No, I go to a school to learn how to do hair. It's a government program. But really I want to be a model - and I am definitely not sellin'.
Yeah, i been waiting three years.
No, baby, nothin' like that. Look, there's a place across the street. We can go right over there...
You and the other one, you're still Billy's girls. You always were his girls...
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Okay, let's get down to it.  I did my part and got you out.  So now you tell me where we're goin'?
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Just up the street, the other side, over there ... Now, don't bother knockin' on the door. Luther ain't the kind of guy that looks for company.
But you can handle it all right, huh? Real amazin' how far a gun and a badge can carry some cats...
If we come outta this joint with Ganz' phone number, or a dead Indian, or anything else useful, then you could turn the other way for half an hour while I get laid...
What are you talkin' about?
You wanna leave, man?  Let me take care of Ganz all by myself.
They saved your ass, convict.
How much?
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Musta got some primo bondsman.
No class...
We're getting too close ... Cates, what's the matter, you been takin' dumb pills?
Bullshit. Then i'm staying with the money.
Where's luther?
Thanks for callin' in... and I guess Maybe... Look, I'm sorry I called you Watermellon nigger... those kinds of things. I was just leanin' on ya, doin' my job.
Why?
Notice something funny about that bus?
Wait a minute, Cates.  I've been waitin' three years for that.  I don't think it's fair, man. What about the merit system.? You were gonnna give me a few thousand.
Hey, the bastard's got my gun.  I want it back.
Yeah.  It bothers me when cops get hurt while I'm makin' a play. I don't like it.
Okay.  You're not a team player. You gotta do things your own way. Fine.  Nail this guy and make us all look good.  But you better watch your ass.  If you screw up, I can promise you, you're goin' down.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
I lost them, that's what happened.
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Yeah.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
This guy must have had a .44 like yours, Jack. Now he's got yours.
Tell me that's not the same guy.
Haven't seen him for years. That's the truth.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Thanks for the coffee.
Jack, are you okay?
Hello.
How do you know?
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
Whaddya think?
Hard man to live with.
I can't get it until Monday. Honest.
You chickenshit punk...
Yeah, I know that, but this is me and we're old friends. I haven't got the money so what are you gonna do about it?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Your theory is interesting Father but I don't think we have time to go into it right now!
You're a good man... She was right to have chosen you...
Do you love her?
At least, the cat comes back.
Hi Ma...
Yeah?
You have nine points left on your license..
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
What mission?
Just one... why me?
And the third one?
I thought you were divorced.
Apipoulai!
Finished what?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
You know women normally change five times more than men.
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Thanks..
It's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 DNA memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..This one has 200,000.
Is that better?
Wait or act.
My philosophy Mr. President is shoot first ask questions later. I don't like uninvited guests.
Lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Am I disturbing you?
...Not far, now.
This is the mortgage.  This is Cindy's college money.
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
It's a missing persons case... a long shot.  I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back.  We'll take a vacation.
Why the gun?
I'm okay.  Please, honey, I can't explain.  Don't use the phone, just pack a bag and get out.  I'm on my way.  I'll be back at the house in three hours.  Call me from the hotel when you get there
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
You're killing me...
She died in her sleep three days ago.  It was in the paper...
You know where I can get it?  I have a lot of money to spend.
Bullshit.
What the fuck... !
And the other performer... it has to be that monster you use... the man in the mask.
You have a beautiful face... the way the light hits it.  I'd like to take your picture.  You don't mind?
Excellent.
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?
He doesn't know anything... he's got nothing to do with this...
Is that him?
You're a dead man.
Leave him alone.
I'm not so sure about this.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
I told you, I don't know.
Okay, we'll come back to that.  So, six years ago a guy contacts you, through the classifieds, over the phone, however he does it.  It's Longdale, looking for a snuff film. And you, entrepreneur that you are, tell him you can hook him up.
Show me where you buried her.
Do it.
You were the middleman, am I right? Old man Christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.
So, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand-boy.  And if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film.  That's the beauty of lawyer/client privilege.
Followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
Well, here's the deal, Max.  This thing I'm on right now has something to do with underground pornography. Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally...
You're not a cop, are you?  If I ask and you are, you have to tell me.
Not quite.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
How much do you make now?
Interesting theory.
There's two kinds of specialty product; legal and illegal.  Foot fetish, shit films, watersports, bondage, spanking, fisting, she- males, hemaphrodites... it's beyond hardcore, but legal.  This is the kind of hardcore where one guy's going to look at it and throw up, another guy looks at it and falls in love.  Now, with some of the S+M and bondage films, they straddle the line.  How are you supposed to tell if the person tied up with the ball gag in their mouth is a consenting or not?  Step over that line, you're into kiddie porn.  Rape films, but there aren't many.  I've never seen one.
Take a vacation.  I'll pay you four hundred a day, plus expenses.
It's their Presidential Suite.
Please, believe me.  This is probably a stag film.  Simulated rape.  Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
I deal in divorce cases.  Corporate investigations...
You've found missing persons before.
How are you?  Having any luck?
So, she didn't leave a note?  She never gave any indication where she might go, before she left?
She just seemed... depressed... ?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
Doesn't make much sense, does it? When everything's happy, when life's fine and you have every reason to believe there's a God, you don't bother.  Then, something horrible happens... that's when you start praying all the time.  That's when you start going to church.
Do you think the police did a good job?
Will you let me look?
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
They killed her, and they took her out in the forest somewhere and they buried her...
What is this?
Yeah.  She'd be half as strict as you.
You what?
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
We have matching luggage.
Not really.
Enough of that crap.
Nice neighborhood.
Sorry!! Sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. In case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and I'm the LAST COURSE!!
Avoid-all-contact-day.
You don't get it, he's after me...
What do you mean?
Jesus!  Don't do that!
I watched from behind the stands.  Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know.  "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
Very funny.
I've got to go.
Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
They're so remote - cold - beautiful, the stars.  But now - I wonder -
Maybe - just 'maybe' - when their ship doesn't return - they'll decide not to come here, after all.
So all of a sudden his only son drops out of school, be- gins making noises like a pacifist.  A real egghead, do-gooder, and crackpot!  'Ban the atom tests!  Junk the nuclear subs!  Spend the mili- tary budgetfor peace!'
Have you ever talked to Carl - tried to see his side?
How about that! The bow drove half through her, but she sealed herself right up.
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Wonder where Powell and Carney are?
Dave - !
Get ready.  We shove off as soon as Griff reports all the crew aboard.
Course and speed?
The frogmen?
The inertial navigation system. Must have been knocked out in the crash.
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
What do you think?
What?
What's the corrected bearing to the Magnetic Pole?
Swell!
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Just musing about our 'one-eyed adversary' and the legend of Homer.  'Cyclopes' were the Sons of Heaven, who forged the thunder- bolts thrown by Zeus.
Yeah, sure. Why? I got this damned tooth, I got a few things bugging me, like everybody else. But I'm okay.
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Yeah. I know about that.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Chub says you're fired.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
It would help if you were married, if there was someone at home while you work.
I plan to. Soon.
I hear Twombley got shot.
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Drafted by the Red Sox.
You played for the Sox?
Hmm.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Fresh tracks.  Deer shit. Big one. Here's your buck, Mr. Twombley. I'll circle around.
LaRiviere's having a hell of a time in there. Master of fucking ceremonies.
Where'd Twombley get shot?
You stayed away?
What blood?
Why do they do that?
You know.
To us it was.
Why? Why not? You know these kids from when you went to school here. It hasn't been that long.
I want to go home.  I don't like it here.
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Come and get you! Shit! It's a damn half hour drive each way. Why didn't you talk to me about it first?
Where's the plow?
You don't want the extra police pay?
Fuck you.
I figured you already heard.
How you holding up, Wade?
On what you pay me?
He say anything about the summons I tried to give him? Sonofabitch wouldn't accept it.
Maybe.
You and Mel Gordon?
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
It's just...
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
Good. Who?
I still don't understand --
How's she doing?
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm sorry.
Yeah. I mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
I know your parents.
How?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
There's a furnace.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
He's asleep. We were up very late.
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.
It don't look right.
Not since last night. He took a guy hunting.
He got his deer yet?
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Yeah.
Love! I'm made of love!
Everything you know is from me.
Rolfe.
I guess it was an accident, like everybody thinks.
Which is?
That it wasn't an accident.
Motive. You gotta have a motive.
Money.
Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
Do you see the maintenance panel?
It's cut.
How we doing, Colonel?
Iraqi's won't buy it. Either they're already in on this or they'll think we're spying.
You're duty to what? The country you served doesn't exist anymore.
why did they do that?
Where are we now?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
Romeo Tango Zulu, do you have the President? Over.
Fear will keep you alive. Any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
Do you have to be so brutal?
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Let my daughter go or I'll take you out!
No you won't. You'll compromise... like always.
Twenty minutes?
We've already played our cards, Major. There's no turning back.
Sir, we stay with the President.
You know what?
Flying the plane.
Someone should give you a raise.
Did they say anything about my family?
You know my policy. We don't negotiate with terrorists. If we start now, all of America becomes a target.
But...
White House switchboard. How may I direct your call.
Sir, the Speaker of the House attacked this administration on national television.  You can't afford to leave that hanging.
IT'S OPEN!
And what do the boys on the board know about safety, Commissioner?  Let <u>me</u> talk to them.
What?
Yes it did.  Mr. Dunn, can I ask you a personal question?
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
Then you <u>do</u> think I'm insane.
Ted!
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
Simon.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Elaine, ask ROK for a field interference scan.  Those sun spots might give us a problem with our communications.
Life support check.  Elaine, it's obvious you've been ignoring me.  You're a woman. I can relate to that.
I sure an glad they let Scraps ride up here with us.
How many kids get a chance to live on another planet.
Sure.
He's a boy dog.
Sixteen 'C', why?
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
Look at this wiring.  It's shorting out under high temperatures.
Striker.
Uh... oh, thank you.  It's nothing.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
I'm getting over it.  If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
Do you want to talk about it.
Well, it really wasn't a vacation. You see, I'm a teacher in the New York City school system, and I was attending a seminar on visual aids to education. Are you from L.A.?
Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
George Zipp said that?
Captain, how soon can we land?
Well...not for another two hours.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
Elaine!
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Hey, we've been waiting for you. A little bit late tonight.
Oh, I'd love to.
Roger.
Could I borrow your guitar? I thought I might be able to cheer her up.
The cockpit? What is it?
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
There's lots of things I haven't done, but his ain't high on the list.  Don't take it personally.
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
He's not here.  Why ask me?
In there.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
Yes...
Yes, I heard about poor Warren. Tragic.
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
His body was discovered three days ago, in an alley off of Central Avenue, near downtown.
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
There was no wallet... but he was still wearing a watch and two rings.
Well... yes, quite possibly.
What's this?  What's going on?
Aw-right.  What about the other guy?
Why did you do it?
I don't think I could ever learn to read that shit.  How long did it take you to learn English?
I'll bet.  Would it really put you out if they tossed that on the grill for a minute or two?
Where'd you get this?!!
Well, let's roll, George.
Why?
No secrets, goddammit!  You don't hold back from me.  Whatever is going on, you're gonna tell me now!
Okay, George -- we gotta play this real smart.
No he's not.  Not if he overdosed on the drug.  Massive amounts trigger a... a change.  Your body functions seize up, you appear to be dead, but it's really a state of incubation.  When you emerge you're...
What is it?
Wait.  You know who it looks like? Yeah.  Anderson.  Uh... James Anderson.  He isn't in today.  He took the afternoon off.
Don't piss him off, O'Neal.  When he gets like this, I can't control him. I've seen this before.  He got like this once -- I saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. Nothing I could do.  I hadda go throw up.
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Hope their plumbing's the same.
Whoooah!  No shit?  I'm impressed.
Position?
But these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
What?
Is she...?
What if I said I could get you reinstated as a flight officer? And that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
Yeah?  Maybe the organisms like the heat, that's why they built...
They can bill me.  I got a tab running.  What's second?
You son of a bitch.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
What's he scanning for?
Sir, the CPU is on-line.
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Well that's great!  That's just fucking great, man.  Now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? We're in some real pretty shit now!
Maybe we got 'em demoralized.
Look, you started this.  Now show me everything.  I can handle myself.
Yeah.  What?
Casey.  She's my only friend.
Why not?
You promise?
Yes, there are, aren't there.
Burke!  Open the door!
The analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
Why not?
You might be disappointed.
Well, what does it matter to you?
No, she's fine.
Your son is an unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
You have leave to try.
I wish you to return immediately to Salzburg. Your father is waiting for you there patiently. I will speak to you further when I come.
I've come to dinnnnnner!
What is it?
Em iram! Em iram!
Eat
Oh, leave me alone.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Tell them to go!
What? How can you be so boring? Tea!
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
What?
Oh, Stanzi.
Who was that?
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
What for?
Your husband is ill, ma'am. He took sick. I brought him home.
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
I see that you're expecting.
I am sorry, Madame. It is not permitted.
I am sorry, Madame, but I have my orders.
Gertrude!
It's just a trifle, of course.
Excuse me, Sire, but what do you think these could be? Being a foreigner, I would love to learn.
Oh, Your Majesty, it would be such a tremendous honour!
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
In a Pasha's Harem, Majesty. A Seraglio.
Keep it, Sire, if you want to. It is already here in my head.
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
I have no idea.
Ah-ha. Well then, we should make some effort to acquire him. We could use a good German composer in Vienna, surely?
Ah-ha. What do you say, Chamberlain?
She's very tired, poor creature. You know me: I'm a real pig. It's not so easy cleaning up after me.
Oh we could, if we wanted to, but Stanzi won't hear of it. She wants to do everything herself.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
What medicine?
Is he working?
Opera? Opera!
Are you Herr Mozart?
'Course you would. You belong here, my boy, not the snobby Court. You could do anything you felt like here - the more fantastic the better! That's what people want, you know: fantasy. You do a big production, fill it with beautiful magic tricks and you'll be absolutely free to do anything you want. Of course, you'd have to put a fire in it, because I've got the best fire machine in the city and a big flood - I can do you the finest water effects you ever saw in your life. Oh, and a few trick animals. You'd have to use those.
Leave that alone!
Can I see it?
Herr Mozart. What a surprise. What can I do for you?
Well. Since it appears nobody is eager to hire my services, could you favour me with a little money instead?
Love, Sire!
I'm flattered. And congratulations to you, of course.
Herr Sommer.
No, but I'm broke. I'm always broke. I don't know why.
I'd better not. It's a bit of a secret.
Cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. Crema al Mascarpone.
Ah. Italian?
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
It's not fair that a man like that has power over our work.
Oh, Excellency, would you?
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Yes?
I have come to commission work from you.
A Mass for the dead.
What dead? Who is dead?
What happened? Is it over?
This is only a vaudeville.
What?
Would you? Actually, you could.
You know, it's all here in my head. It's just ready to be set down. But when I'm dizzy like this my eyes won't focus. I can't write.
Where did I stop?
Strange!
With the tenors.
Sopranos up to F on the second 'Voca'?
What is this, Herr Chamberlain?
Because His Majesty wishes it.
Kapellmeister Bonno, Count Orsini- Rosenberg and Court Composer Salieri.
They hate my music. It terrifies them. The only sound Italians understand is banality. Tonic and dominant, tonic and dominant, from here to Resurrection!  Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Ba-ba! Anything else is morbid.
Mozart -
Look, young man, the issue is simple. If you want this post, you must submit your stuff in the same way as all your colleagues.
Offer me your confession. I can offer you God's forgiveness.
Here in Vienna.
And do they believe it?
I do not claim to unravel the mysteries. I treasure them. As you should.
What?
No, you didn't!
What difference does that make?
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Yes?
Well, actually, Sire, if you remember, we did finally incline to Italian.
What do you mean - now?
Can we come in?
The American? Yes, duck.
David?
It wasn't a lunatic.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Call me Alex.
What do you dream about?
That's not really a very proper question.
I'm twenty-seven.
Your dead friend Jack?
Bathroom.
There is only one bed.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
The next corner we can get a cab.
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
No.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
There's no call for that kind of language.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
Miss Price, the other nurse that attended you.
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Where am I?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Yes.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
She's a jerk.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
What do you think was wrong?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I heard that.
Plan?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
I wanted to see you.
Yes.
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
Hello.
Excuse me.  Yes?
What's that?
Remember the Alamo?
If she can't pay, I'll have to foreclose, won't I?
Oscar, what's the matter?
How much?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
What's the matter with my policy? How many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I'll tell you. Not a single one!  What's wrong with that kind of banking?
I know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. Get that money over here and I'll stop this run within five minutes.
Come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
What happened?  You're not a thief. How'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
No.
No. No, I'm not. I deliberately avoided you. I was afraid of making a fool of myself. But I won't stand it any longer—
Why, Matt!
I'm not interested in what you think.
I'm feeling fine this morning.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Yes, of course.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs. Pembroke.
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Wait a minute. Where's your uniform?
No. I won't.
You're not giving up, are you, Mr. Dickson?
Wait a minute. Answer my question. Was Mrs. Dickson there?
She was, wasn't she? How long has this been going on? Do you know?
He says he can't get away in the daytime.
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
They've been coming in steady all morning. I have called for some extra police.
Mine too?
Absolutely.
I'm afraid so.
No.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
With what?
What's keeping you?
Oh now, don't be silly.
Now you've got me worried, dear.  Promise me you won't butt in.
What's he doing, honey? Is he getting any help?
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Sit down! When the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
So you were home last night?
Eleven o'clock, eh? Are you sure it was that?
I'm okay, Matt.
Everybody in?
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
The sheriff says it was a gang of drunk Kansas boys.
As long as people think Jesse's still riding, we will never get the respect we deserve.
They said because the detectives were working for the Department of the Interior --
You have no shame.
Well, no, Jesse, it was the bank's. That's why we had to go to all that trouble of stealing it.  You explain it to him.
Where you boys going?
You ever notice Zerelda's eyes?
Sure, cousin.
And almost got hanged in peacetime.
Still smells fishy.
Okay, you're gonna rest here.
Tom, why don't you stop at our spread before you head on out to the reservation? Figure we might have some work for you, if you want.
Both would be nice.
On account of we're robbing it.
What the --
So?
Yesss, but I was thinking, I could come by, and then take Zee out. Some place near. With other folk. Near. Here.  But out.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
Every time I put my head up to hit that Gatling, they try to shoot it off.
Distracting enough for you?
Mm-hmm.
You're doing just fine.
All we thought about was coming home. I swore I'd kill anybody who tried to get me off my farm again. If I have to go to war with the railroad to stay, fine by me.
You can shut up now.
You ready to stop loafing around with this young lady and get back to farming?
... We could move on. Rebuild. Make a decent life someplace else.
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
I can't quit and leave you alone. I can't quit until you quit. Ma would've wanted it that way.
Jim was old enough...
I'll meet you down there in a few weeks.
Yeah Jimmy?
You're sick of my company?
Me neither.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
I would never have imagined us in a place like this.
Stop it. This is just sad.
Oh, it's a similar room. But the hotel is in Washington D.C. You're not going to get a fair trial down here, in front of a jury of Jesse James sympathizers.
Almost got me in Billings. I saw you there, shooting at me.
Ahh, you'll miss me.
That was for my Ma. Now this is for everybody else.
Discretion? Sir, I am a man of the cloth.
Thank you.
You been with a girl ever?
I hope you don't mind, Jesse James told me your name.
Not at all.
I just though you were awful cute.
There's only four of them...
Parker, tell me what's going on so I can return as quickly as possible to Boston and my whores and cigars, not necessarily in that order.
Would a jury around here convict their own? I think not. We're beginning an interesting game here, Mr. Rains.
Every three months, the James Gang circles back to the vicinity of Liberty, Missouri. They always pull a job right before they return, probably to have extra money to give family and friends.
What is that?
Yes.
I'm ignoring you.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Take it off.
Why?
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
I never knew you smoked.
You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.
Get married. Have a wedding.
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore.
But what about the past? Our past?
How did you guess?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Are you my two o'clock?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Carnes? Wait.
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I really must...
Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there?
It looks so soft.
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
What...is...it?
Maybe it's just the light.
What's that, a gram?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
I said we are totally booked.
Late?
Oh? And what should I say?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Patrick?
That is...if you're not doing anything.
Oh no. I have no plans.
And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
Sorry. 
Hello? Jean, I need help!
Jean-I'm not-
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
That's...that's too bad.
No. I really don't.
Well, I mean, um, it s really...Bosco. You know, like... like a Dove Bar. It's a Dove Bar...Hershey's Syrup?
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Maybe we could have lunch one day next week? You know, I'm downtown near Wall Street quite often.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.
So, what's the topic of discussion?
How old are you?
Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The American Gardens Building.
Who do you ask?
Would you rather I not smoke?
You sure?
Actually, yes.
Hmmm.
Had his apartment been burglarized?
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
People just...disappear.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Don.
Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame.  Is he a suspect?
Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance?  Which was on the twentieth of December?
What?
Let's see...  That you were with-
He wasn't with Paul Owen.
Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job?
I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you.
Shhhh...it's okay.
Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God.
Yes, Owen?
You think so?
You don't wanna move, do you?
I can't help it. I feel like they'd do anything to keep their --
...But?
Didn't you visit the campus?
That's what I need to ask you.  You know you can't keep anything from me.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried!  What did you see in there?
...Why?
...wanna savor this.
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
What seems to be the problem? You look a little upset.
You're living here?
Well I parked illegally. See y'later?
Great. Great! We need to drag a lot of heavy stuff in front of the door --
He's pretty tight with his family.
Milo. What's up?
Wow. You must have 20,000 lines of code there...
Why did you move around so much? When you were a kid.
Cause he was a liar. And I hated him.  "Get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." The more he mocked me the deeper I went. Cause if being savvy meant being like him --  Guess that's why I'm kind of clueless, even now. Didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'Not sure I even have one.
This is good. Who did it?
Let's go.
What're we looking for?
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
You're compulsive.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
I snuck into #21.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Right. But Gary's tied-in to a lot of media conglomerates. Have to be careful who we pick.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into #21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
We rented a loft in Sunnyvale.  You know what's the bad part? We can't talk about work anymore. We're competitors! The venture capitalists made us sign like 100 confidentiality forms.
There's nothing in this hall. Someone's pulling your chain, as usual.
Wait a second. I'm the one who found out he was mucking around in here in the first place.
Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina. May I call you Alotta...  Please?
I'd rather talk about Number Two.
Care for some saki?
Hey, how are you?
"Fifteen minutes of fame?" I'm going to use that quote and not give you any credit for that, either.
Yes?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Immediately. You'll be working with Ms. Kensington.
Yes?
Hello Austin. Hello Vanessa. This is Basil Exposition, from British Intelligence.  There's a company in Las Vegas called Virtucon that we think may be linked to Dr. Evil. Many of the Virtucon executives gamble at the hotel/casino where you'll be staying. That's the first place you should look.  Well, I'm off to the chat rooms.
Oh, and Austin...
Right away, Exposition.
Yes?
Circus folk.  Nomads, you know. They smell like cabbage.
Maybe these photographs are the last piece of that puzzle.  I've uncovered the details on Project Vulcan. It's a new subterranean warhead delivery system.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
All right, Austin, I think you should go.
Well, Austin, you've stopped Dr. Evil from destroying the world with his subterranean nuclear probe, and somehow you and Agent Kensington managed to escape unscathed from his evil lair.
"You can't always get what you want!" That's a great title for a song! I'm gonna write that, and it'll be a big hit.
Really? Let me ask you this. What is love?
That does not compute.
Well done, Mr. Powers. We're not so different, you and I. It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding. You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point. However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for-- swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to be... evil? Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit.
Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of. Face it, freedom failed.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Excuse me?
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
I'm sure.
I love Las Vegas, man. Oh, I forgot my x-ray glasses.
Fancy a nibble?
I'm sorry.
Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell.
I am not.
Of course, luv.
I can't believe you made love to her just like that. Did you use protection?
Well, it means something to me. If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man.
Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay. Women loved him, man. I didn't see that one coming.
No, no, no. We'll use the floss to get to the ledge.
Danger's my middle name.
Oh my God, he's back.
Someone help me! I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned.
Sea bass.
Really? Are they ill-tempered?
In due time.
You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter.
Did you ever...
And how do you feel about that?
No, he's really evil.
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Seriously?
The technology is brand new. Soon it will be more powerful. We anticipate a huge demand. Leave us your number. We'll be in touch.
How long have I been here?
You
Have we met?
I resign.
What are you trying to do to me?
I thought I was a widow. My husband ... the only man I ever loved ... is dead. For the rest of my life I have to live with that.
To find out who killed my husband.
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
A slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. Fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
But I found you. All the clues led me here ...
You disappoint me, Emma.  Can't you guess?  For you. It was all for you ...
Destruction of their local weather systems. I can zap a thousand Chernobyls into the air.
I shouldn't wonder. Not a woman inside Boodles since --
Under the circumstances, you may call me Mrs. Peel.
You know what I mean. This car -- and you. Nobody walks around like that. Milk?
The most unpredictable piece on the board. And always ready to protect his queen.
You were very lucky.  Four shots to the heart. I found you after I slipped away from Sir August. Mother brought you here. Not me you should thank.
Frankly that's how I remember it.
Any ideas?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
... And by you, Mrs. Peel. Everything points to you.  No sisters?  No undiscovered twin?
Is that what you think?
You followed me.
But you did suspect me.
I thought you didn't.
You lied.
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
We must hurry, Mrs. Peel ...
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
Limpet bomb. Small, very compact. From Trubshaw's.
Still a bit chilly ...
Our chaperon.
Peter's brother?  But --
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
Weather's turning nasty.
Think she really killed those agents?
Possibly. Split personality ...
This man -- did you see him?
I was hoping you could tell me.
Walk over to the window ...
I was at Harrow ...
One shot -- for emergencies.
You are, and it's behind you.
They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
That's what we're going to find out...
Yeah, man. Let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
Five thousand dollars.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Oh, come on, just a little.
It's not her mind you need to change. It's Disneyland head in there.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Well, tell the asshole to shut up.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Cole?
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
Good...
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
Your mother's not dead.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let's get naked.
Yeah.
Ilene, are you crazy?
What are you...
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
I'm going to see what the hell happened.
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You okay?
Oops!
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Rick!
Ed... you're kinky!
Klupner.  Mrs. Klupner.
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
I'm not really hungry.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
How 'bout this?
Now, don't get into any trouble.
-- What the fuck were you thinking, huh? Burning people? You're a fireman.
...What do you want me to do, Stephen? Talk to me. What am I supposed to do?
Who asked you?
Been ripping off fire stations?
In the Field Museum once.
Sheep don't count.
Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
Y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. I told you to stay beside me.
Hey.
You got a problem with drilling, probie?
You okay?
Well, long as you're here you can help clean up a little. I've got a guy coming to look at this in a few minutes.
You're selling dad's boat?
Oh God, Stephen, what's going on with you?
What are we going to do about this?
What was that? Oh man, you have picked up a few moves since John Paul II Boulevard.
How's it going?
Okay.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Jesus, give him a break. There isn't enough proof yet to go public. Sure, we found some chemical shit we think somebody dumped in the plugs to torch 'em, and we've maybe figured out why backdrafts, but you can't rush this stuff. Not 'till it's locked.
This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
Then why did you quit?
-- Bullshit! You knew what I told you wasn't ready for the papers --
What is --
What'll you do?
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
I don't have a story.
-- I wanted to be him. Right then I wanted to be him more than anything...
I want another shot, Sir.
Even if you graduate this academy, you've still got nine months of probation. That's hard duty, son. If you don't really love this job, it'll kill you.
Then go find a corner. I don't want you in my way.
Glass found in ignition room is in small, thin pieces, indicating explosion. Lack of discoloration indicates a long, slow burn. Explosion must of come after a slow burn.  You little tease... What were you up to you little bastard, huh? What made you that mad?  Or scared.  It started in this room. Took its time, hung out... but the air ran out. It couldn't breathe. So it was snuffed. But it wasn't dead... still all that trapped heat, lying low, waiting for some sucker to open the door and give it that one gulp of air...
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Uh, I don't think that's in my contract...
But the right guess on this is arson.
I got it after we talked to Ronald. Torches. Want to fry the whole goddamn world. But the fires that killed those guys never really burned up much. -- The burns were all lit in outlets surrounded by double firebreaks in the walls. And he made his burns backdrafts. 
Why backdrafts. Whoever fried Seagrave and Cosgrove went to a helluva lot of trouble to make sure they died by fire, but also made sure the fire blew itself out.
Well that's two things to strangle Stephen for. Where is he, anyway?
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
And I'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, Brian.
-- That really was incredibly work you did. You and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? You must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.
Brian, let me come to the point. I'd like to offer you a job.
Yeah, we got all kinds of traditions -- like dying young.
Mr. McCaffrey...
Completely out of control.
Aren't you even curious?
Really. Well, let's have a look at what else was "in your blood". I always look forward to getting these, they make such a nice collage for the bar... "Assistant Director, Sales, Aspen Snowmobile Tours..."
He's going to be a fireman.
I just wanted to, I don't know, not exactly apologize for the other night -- especially since I don't remember much of it --
How ya doin', Ronald. Staying comfortable?
-- Burn them.
I'm working on it.
Investigator Rimgale.
Jesus, open your eyes! Seagrave, Cosgrove, and now Holcomb -- fried in a goddamn high-rise!
Mr. Swayzak! How ya doin'?
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that...  First time shooting up?
You took the chalice.
Are you all right, honey?
So what are you doing here?
Oooo... Big fucking scary guy. Just put $120,000 on tomorrow's game.
What case?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
You truly are a dancing fool.
Ho!
That'swhatI'msayin'.  I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
My own sister throwin' me out.  I hope to seeya later when you get ya mind right.  Don't bother letting me out.
What are you talkin' about?
You're in this up till ya neck.
To what?
Do you know how much information can be dispensed in one minute alone?
So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium.
I'm feelin' dis'!
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Yep, you guessed it.
Negroes would be in an uproar.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Daddy, she's younger than me.
Purely for medicinal purposes.
You okay?
I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
What do you want me to say?
So you have your small victory, now what?
Is that good or bad?
How long have you and Hambone been hangin' out?
He's just playing big brother.
So they can be on TV.
Same thing Giuliani said.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
He wants you to come and see him.
I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Not at all?
Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.
Tavis, thank you for having me.
Money and nothing else?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
You tellin' the truth.
She hates dem.
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
Not for me, my woolly headed cotton pickin' friend for...
...aconite get it dat cheap.
...perfect...
...like grits and butter...
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
No, before my time.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
Why don't you call him?
So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
I'm not afraid of highwaymen.  My man is armed, and so am I.
I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Dugan. I have had enough of Miss Dugan here and your Irish ways.  I ain't used to 'em, sir.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might.  But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough.  I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
What is the service, sir?
He'll give the better mark.  I am not afraid of him.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business.  The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her.  You are but a boy.  Best is willing to consider you as such.  Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service.  Make Best an apology, and be off.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
You're an impostor, young man, a schemer, a deceiver!
Chevalier, if you will have your money now, you must fight for it. If you will be patient, maybe I will pay you something another time.
Your honor must lower his voice.
I entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me.  If I do not know it, I am innocent.
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man.  He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
Yes!
That fool didn't know what was the meaning of a hundred-pound bill, which was in the pocket-book that the fellow took from me.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
There are a few other points we should discuss.  The loan agreement can only be executed by her ladyship's signature, and provided that Bracegirdle and Chatwick can be assured of her ladyship's freewill in giving her signature.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
Papa?
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
Sir, let those laugh that win.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
Yeah, if you've slept.
I asked for a policeman.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
I apologize --
You know how to work a pistol, Dunbar?
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Pike and I got separated... then I heard gunfire. Close.
We just want to check your pack --
You hated West more than any of us.
Oh, come on --
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
Why... why didn't you tell me?
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
I don't know --
Where are they!
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
Habeas Corpus -- you have to have a body to have a crime.
You mean not enough to save you.
You're a good soldier, Bill.
If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
I wanted to see if he was okay --
I didn't mean that as a compliment.
He got me through Basic and a lot of other stuff. I owe him.
It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Good cop/bad cop?
You made me look like an idiot --
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
The very same.
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
That bugs you too?
So what now?
Four --
Think it'll work?
Maybe we shouldn't go.
No one else heard it?
We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but --
What happens to Dunbar now?
Sir, yes, sir!
I know her uncle. Friends of the family.
I have to leave. Tonight.
Why?
Don.
Did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
How old are you?
I know.
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
Will never told you that?  Probably just as well. He would have told it all wrong anyway. All the facts and none of the flavor.
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Yourself. Good, bad, everything. Just show me who you are for once.
How what happens?
I was drying out.
Really.
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
You didn't become crazy.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I'm going with you.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
What I mean is, do you really know what's going on in his head?
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
What for?
What do you mean?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
You must have a visa or something...
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He wants a lot of money.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
I don't want to talk about it.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
Why?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
I got what I paid for.
Are you scared?
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
I'm sorry.
You have excellent English.
Oh! Gave me a start.
Yes?
You take her to a doctor?
Is your niece older than 12?
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Folks can dance when they want. Didn't buy that mirror ball for nothin'.
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Hi.
Still need a lift?
Look it. I got somethin' for us. This is gonna help, okay.
And then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
You gonna steal my truck?
This thing you got... I've heard people say, you'd fuck a tree if it was handy. I can see that.  But that nigger Tehronne. Thinks he's some player cuz he hustles dope and stolen hubcaps. I mean, I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Let go...
Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off.
Don't... don't say that to me...
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
I ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... Remember like I say, I found you in the road...
Now, no harm's come to you... and I aim to keep it that way. Ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. I'd be chasin' you all night.
How you let men treat ya like they do?
We got everything we need. Plenty of food. Ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Now that's sharp. That is sharp. Chain give you any trouble?
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
What is it?
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
Go'on and sing it, I'll play.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
You ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. I got my mind made up and I ain't gonna be moved on this.
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
You say she was beat on. You call the sheriff on that?
What? I called Bojo, like you say. Called up the fellas in the band...
You won't at the square this mornin'.
I skipped lunch.
You a preacher?
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Yeah?
Well. That's my vomit. I came in here to get sick. I thought I'd make the toilet but... anyway, I got sick.
Holy shit!
All my life I been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. And you gonna lay the blame at my feet? Well, I ain't gonna take that.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
Alright. How much you need, ho?
Wait up.  You know the guy who did the Weismuller through the window --
Maybe we should do something?
What are you doing?
Nick... You up?
Hey, when in Rome --
Let's grab some food.
You cool, Ich?
Give me a break, would you?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
... We got to keep looking.  Track him down!  Great balls of fire!
Why the hell not?
Know her?
What's he saying?
Nick, no one's seen Kobo in three days.  He might not even be in Tokyo.
She disappeared... shit!
... A Godfather.  His man was killed at the printing plant.
He'll never speak to a Gaiijin.
It's very small.
Grab the keys, Ich, and get inside.
I don't know.
Where's Ich?
I need someone to translate for me.
And I'm supposed to care?
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense.  I chant.
Who am I supposed to be?
Ugly... A couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  Looking in.  Always afraid. Ugly little lives...
Guess I'm on a roll.
She's such a long way home for you.
This by this...
Why?
He was my partner.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
Could you fill me in?
While you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I have to get to Sugai.
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Where?
What's the point?
Then go get him.
What's the problem?
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
He's not really my friend.  I just do a job for him now and then.
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
He's not ready yet.
She was gonna get away.
Yeah.
What about a summary then.
It's okay.  Forget it.
What's that?
Nerves of steel.
No rust?
Meaning?
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
Taffey Lewis?
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
That's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. Bit I don't think that's her.
What shows?
Me and my dad.
Yeah.  Sometimes.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
What?
May I ask a personal question?
Go ahead.
We're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, Deckard.  Concentrate.
What?
A tortoise.  What's that?
I'm hungry, J.F.
Methuselah Syndrome.
My glands.  They grow old too fast.
Hi!
This is my new friend...
We want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
Maybe we shouldn't fight at all. Fighting is pretty immature.
I came on a bus.
Oh, that's nice.
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Yes.
Thank-Q!
...Okay.
Two weeks.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
No way.
You wanted to see me!
I've never lied to you.  I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
What?
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
No.
Ooooohhhh!!  Of course! The father! Forgive me!!  Can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  Everything has been so awful!!
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
The nocturnal flying mammal?
Well, do we just go on up?!
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
You're sure?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
Yeah.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
That's why little things mean so much to him.
You bet!
A magazine?  A toy perhaps?  In the bookstore.
Up here on the fifteenth floor?
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
I'm afraid you've got to.
We have to go.
And now you must let me be the judge of that!
The neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. She'd bring him sandwiches and hot Dr. Pepper.
He drank it hot?
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
The locks.
I'm not hungry.
I've noticed.
Calvin!
Let's eat our cake.
Um... Eve?
What?
Yeah! That's thinking.
Doctor Gynde, my whole family's sick. What's going on?
Frank. Come in.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. There behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come into the study a minute.
Yes.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
GET OUT OF THERE!!! GET OUT!!! Put your hands up, on your head. GO ON!!! Get down on your knees - DO IT!! What are you doing? Who are you? What's your name? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
What? Are you kidding me? Who sent you here?
The phone. What did you hear on the phone. Tell me. Word for word.
Don?
Yes, I like you.
It's a secret so don't tell anyone. Some day I'll show you where. I've gotta go to sleep now.
No.
Don? Are you in with them?
Why are you so interested? Why do you keep asking me?
Are you a bad boy?
Frank would open you.
Does that scare you?
Shut up.
You what?
Okay. Soon? Do you think I'm too fat?
What?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. He's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. Let me wet my whistle, baby.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Frank?
You want to see him too, right?
Hey neighbor. Here's to Ben.
What are you lookin' at?
Come on. I wancha to meet a frienda mine. Raymond, get enough beer for Ben too.
No, I want ya to fuck it. Shit, yes, pour the fuckin' beer.
For good? I can't Mom. Not right in the middle of the term.
What time are visiting hours?
Well. Okay.
It would be too much for him. So please let him think as he does, that you're home just to see him.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
How is Central these days?
Yeah. What are you doing now?
Come on, you brought it up. Do you know anything?
Where are they?
I've gotta go in.
What will I say when she comes to the door?
Alright.
Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
Oh, okay, can I call?
What did you see?
You want to tell me about it?
I'm really sorry.
You like mysteries that much?
You didn't tell him about me?
Okay.
I'd rather not talk about it. I'll tell you about it sometime.
You look beautiful.
You want to dance?
NO.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Probably not. No. Why?
Hey come here, you stole my girl, you bastard. I'm gonna kick your ass, right in front of your stupid house.
Don't start with your shit. Don't you talk to me. Oh, hey Uncle Gussy, thanks for years of service. Here's a gold watch and a job sniffing other guys' shit eight hours a day. What am I, a retired bus driver?
What?
You think they sold me out? No way.
What?! What are you doin'?
What... the dirty bitch! I hope ya trounced her a good one!
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
So, how is it that you guys are fluent in Russian?
I think it's better if we find this man before he finds us again.
I do believe the Monsignor finally got a point.
"Now, that wasn't too polite, was it?"
I have no idea. Maybe someone saw and talked.
See. I told you there'd be a shaft.
Where the fuck are you going?
Nine bodies.
We've teamed up with a sex offender.
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
That's the guy that got us off the hook with the "Checkov" thing.
Now, you will receive us.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Okay, just cut off as much fat as you can as it goes by and the rule of thumb here is...
Of course they were. How many?
What?
Your what?! Your fuckin' what?!
Pee...Per...Man.
And the pennies?
The two bullets went in here, through the top of the skull, criss-crossed and exited through the eyeballs. This one clue tells us three distinct facts. Number one... Duffy.
Duffy. This look like a fucking post office to you? This guy came in here with intent. Maybe he didn't know exactly what he was gonna do but he had a pretty good idea. The bartender wasn't a fucking accident.
He's struck again, hasn't he, Greenly?
Right now.
Hey Murph.
Hey, Murph.
This is some crazy shit, man!
Why have you come to a church for council if you're not religious?
Do you think they would harm an innocent man, for any reason?
Continue the joke.
Joey Bevo said it was important. Said I had to give it to him myself.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
This is he?
The list, Dignan. I know you remember the list because you signed it. "Things Dignan was not supposed to touch."
You're making fun of my family. You know there's nothing to steal from my mom and Craig. You know exactly what you're saying.
Where's the manager?
Like he would find Dignan. One day.
What do you think?
He was the driver, Dignan. He did what he's supposed to do.
See if mine are in there.
That's real cool, Anthony. Yeah, I wore boots. My parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. I wasn't spoiled.
OK. Go ahead.
Right. Get back to me on that one. Once your plan is worth a shit.
Hi.
Inez, this is --
No. I didn't. Dignan, they don't speak English.
They don't?
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
Where was it parked?
He told me because he wanted to know if I wanted to go.
If you'd gone with Bob you'd probably be in Weatherford by now. Of course I'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
I wish I'd been there.
Sixteen dollars.
A $500 tip! For the housekeeper!
When'd you get back?
Shit, Dignan.
Uh-huh?
I'll see you there.
What?
Where?
How?
When we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
Nice to meet you.
Yes, he did.
Me?
Why'd you want to help us?
What do herbs have to do with it? I don't understand the --
In your backyard? How do you protect them?
I don't know. I personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
Bob, where you going?
You think I'm improving?
It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
Let's not even talk about it.
It's in the driveway.
Nice to meet you, Applejack.
What do you mean?
Where'd they come from?
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
Is that him?
What are you talking about, Bob?
How much could you grow? Realistically.
Six thousand dollars? Come on, Bob.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Did we get it?
In all probability nothing would of happened. But why take the chance? That's why I ran. I mean how many plants were even back there? Five? Ten?
My brother's in jail.
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I don't know.
Bob, that makes no sense.
Give me the keys, Dignan.
His name's not Future Man, Dignan.
Come on, Bob.
We don't have rooms, Bob. We have cells.
Do you have your own cell?
Fancy seeing you here, Bob.
Your brother was up here the other day. He said you ran away from home.
Yes.
Well, I think --
Why did he go that way? 
You a good pool player.
I don't know.
Si. Tecate. You like to fight?
Mr. Henry?
The world needs dreamers, son.
Never heard of it.
And what are we looking for?
Did he say anything to you?
Don't know.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
It was my job. My first time. Your father was supposed to be alone. But then your mother, she came out of nowhere...  I had to change my plan.  You understand me?  You don't have to live like that anymore. Thinking that.
They loved you.  And I killed them.
Felt a little light.
You still should've moved.
Try again.
You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me?
A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new.
Pamela Landy?
You called it in?
No. There's nothing new.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
-- it hasn't been two years --
You are better. And I think it's not memories at all. It's just a dream you keep having over and over.
I love you, too.
You do?
I did... Jason, I swear, I did... I told them... I told them I believed you...
You left a print! There was Kel that didn't go off! There was a partial print, they tracked it back to Treadstone! They know it's you!
What was Landy buying? What kind of files?  WHAT WAS SHE BUYING?
Why are you here, then?
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Where am I?
Thank you for your gift. I'm sorry about Marie.
We need to get in there.
Looks like he's been detained.
-- Kurt's reopening all the wyfi and sat links --
Alright... take it down.
You're sure?
Yes, sir -- ma'am...
Not good enough. You're the person who floated this amnesia story.  Ever feel sorry for him? For what he'd been through?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
No. Munich's a bust. He's loose.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
May he rest in peace... You have already sealed the coffin?
He was a modest man.
What choice do they have? Now they must serve us or starve.
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
Stephen ready?
I rest.
Armed?
You win.
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
Then why does he stay? My scouts say he has not advanced.
You spoke with this Wallace in private. What kind of man is he?
Never, in my whole life, did I swear allegiance to your king --
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
You scare me.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. He fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! Now that is romance, Oui?
It's battle I want, not talk.
Peace is made is such ways.
I'm no coward! I want what you want! But we need the nobles.
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
Righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
How. Did you. Know that?
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
Just tell me if anything weird happens.
What did you see? What did it look like?
It's a little complicated. I haven't seen results exactly like these before.
I thought you were a December baby.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
When we were kids. Your dad was making a movie. Robin Hood or something?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I get it. You can drop it now.
Ha! Where's that?
Because you're... different.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Is something the matter?
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
What's happened to -- How are you doing that?
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Can... can... Can I have this?
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
What?
Destroy it?
Tommy, I'm bored shitless over here. What's up already?
What the hell are you doing?
Listen to me good, Evan...
I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance.
Here you go, buddy.
Yes?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
Oh, two weeks, maybe three.
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Rick?
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
Occupied France?
Not an easy day to forget.
Uh huh.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
When will he be back?
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
This time they really mean to stop me.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
I must find out what Berger knows.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Yes?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
Sam?
-- Is what?
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
I beg your pardon?
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
No, Captain, please.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
The plane to Lisbon.  You would like to be on it?
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
Is that a serious offer?
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Yeah? Why?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
Ilsa Lund.  That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
I have the letters right here.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
No.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
I don't want them here overnight.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Just a little something of my own.
Take it, damn it.
Polaris, where are you?  Maybe I'm too far south.
You're beautiful.  Marry me.
The sea is lovely, dark and deep.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
What's so damn funny?
Jesus.
You came on a bicycle?  No wonder it's so late.
Our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
Is that Jango?
What's that?
The plane went down.  My friends died.  I washed up on an island.  Then I found these barrels, built the raft, and here I am.
The tide came in, the tide went out.  I survived.  That's the headline.  I survived.
Come on.  Try.
What will you do?
You're not out of Pascagoula, are you?
Look, I help take care of the place.  You got my check, didn't you Mom?
When'd you start working here?
Trying.
What do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
Jesus.  I got it working... You have no idea how hard it was... They're finally a team...
A hundred rubles St. Petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
I braided them.
To Wilson.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
Whoever they were, they didn't *do* any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Better than I can!
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
How about him not needin' the friggin' compass! How about that?
How could you not *care* about the movie?
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
*What* will be okay?
Please don't...
I can't go nowhere.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I thought they might take me.
Dr. Larch wouldn't let just anyone take *any* of us!
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Homer... doesn't King Kong think the woman is his *mother*?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
A B-24 Liberator.
Liberator...
At what altitude?
Well, sure... that's good, then.  All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
I'm stayin', Homer.
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' *hitch-hikin'* if she don't got a good knife with her.
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
It's obviously an aborticide.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
I haven't, either. But you *will*. The morons who write the books should do a little research *here*.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
You can't think that a man who has *served* under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little *snow*-- have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of *disease* that part of the world is?
I fail to see how a little Christianity could *hurt* anyone here!
No autonomic effects... that's correct.
When will he be home, Major?
Ain't you gonna see what it is, Homer?
She's *good* with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than *you* is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
So we've been meeting with banks all day. It's amazing how many ways they can say "no" without ever using the word.
Don't tell me you started a tech firm here before us.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
We had to finalize the deal.
I know. It won't go unnoticed.
What's this?
And I think it's because of this redhead...
Grifters...
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
Keep going. I want to know how you got Lionel Dolby.
Nice.
Back in WWI or WWII, one of the WW's, if you took the time to light three cigarettes with one match, some Nazi would be able to figure out where you were. Then, well... It was the last cigarette you and your two buddies ever had. So three on a match is bad luck.
Like putting on a play... Guess some people forgot their lines.
Big Al gets whacked mid-egg foo young. The whole thing took about two and a half hours. That's how good he is.
Jake...
That's a lot of cash. He came up with it pretty quick.
How much we going after?
She up for this?
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
Stake you?
Look at you, you skinny prick.
Attractive girl.
What -- What do we do?
What do I have to do?
You need to get a haircut.
I gotta go get a haircut.
What about this? Do you have any idea what this means? You've killed us. We're dead!
Look at you... You want to go.
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
Why? Your mother not breast feed you or something?
No. You have another part? You'll know what to do.
WHAT?
He wasn't my boyfriend. I had a boyfriend at the time... What was his name? Anyway, Glenn was like thirty. I was only fifteen. But he was a nice guy. Real sweet. Liked to talk. We used to get loaded on pills from the nurses station and then listen to Morrisey or some stupid shit like that.
No, we never got busted. We were done with a shift one night, both a couple of Percocets down and I was telling Glenn about my boyfriend, about how we were thinking about doing it, you know? I was thinking about letting him be my first because I loved him.  What the hell was his name?
What about what?
Sorry. I didn't know...
Tick-tock...
We're getting a little old for running.
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
And like in a game of chess, you've played every possible move in your head...
Aces, Suits.
Ten percent.
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
He's landing. He's got a suitcase on wheels.
I got it figured out... He's got this thing with bathrooms. If he makes it through Customs, he'll be heading for the john.
That's it?
He's headed towards the eastern most exit. Do not, under any circumstances approach. I want to follow this all the way down to Vig.
Don't be an idiot. How hard do you think it is to sell one drug dealer's drugs to another drug dealer? If Vig's right, we might be looking at a hundred, maybe a hundred fifty grand...
That's what I'm talking about.
High five.
I despise the job.
Ouch.
How about fifteen hundred?
How about five hundred.
How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
Right.  Look, I must get back to Habib.
I'll try and make it.
You really are a beautiful woman.
I've got something to tell you.
I've got a job.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
You're entitled to your opinion.
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
Nothing about you.
Your father?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Do you believe in astrology?
Absolutely not.
And I thought you were a bright woman.
How much do you owe?
Let it go.
That bruise has cleared up nicely.
I'm Lucy.
I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
Over the river.
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
She's my baby.
No thanks, Matt. I need my eight hours.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Rough day?
I'd like to buy you a drink.
I'm sorry, sir, that's a late bet.
David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
I just want the job.
Why don't you take a break, Jack.
Bruised.
Where's the fail-safe key?
Where is it? What did you do with it?
All right, then...
Why doesn't Talby ever eat down here with the rest of us?
Talby, Talby, can you read me?
Thanks.
Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22 minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you read me, bomb?
But you can't explode in the bomb bay. It's foolish. You'll kill us all. There's no reason for it.
False data can act only as a distraction. Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.
Hey, bomb.
That's it.
Why don't you have more time?
Mafhkin oble groop...
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I need a GHF reading on the gravity correction.
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
I like it up here.
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
Lieutenant Doolittle, I'm getting a definite malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems...
Don't worry about it. We'll find out when it goes bad.
Ah, well, I think I've found the malfunction, sir. I'm in the Emergency Air Lock...
When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
What was that, Doolittle?
That's correct, sir.
What should we do, sir? The time is running out.
Oh, yeah?
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
What?
Move it.
It concerns only Jah.  But, in this case, I was the instrument of the Most High.
I'll give you seventy-five bucks for it.
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Guess it wasn't the pizza delivery guy.
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
Lauren's not my wife.
Fortunately, my needs are met in that department.
It was open.
Expensive gifts, surprise late-night visits, over-the-top flattery... You always come on this strong?
How much do you know?
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Forty-seven people drowned last night off the coast of Vancouver after paying smugglers twenty thousand apiece to get into Canada so they could get work in order to eat.  Only they got marched overboard at gunpoint instead.
Know where I can find her?
Any idea when she'll be back?
Look, I don't know what you want--
Oh?
You did.
She was a nurse.  She must've lived near there, somewhere, near the...  ...the clinic.  There must be some registry of nurses or medical technicians or whatever for Wyoming.
Your fiance has four previous wives.  His M.O. is to clean 'em out and take off.  Which is what you oughta do.
I'm sorry I couldn't come up with something more positive.
Zero... C'mon, Dan I don't have all day.
Straight.
And back at ya.  Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Gotta go.
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
Not right now.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Feel like the dog's dinner.
Tell everybody hey.
Catch you back at the wall.
Quitting time.  Grab a cold one?
Right, the big one-oh.
You blew off your girlfriend last night, even though it was the big one-oh.  I'd be pissed off too if I was her.
Or do you think we're just so grateful to have one of you idiots we'll look the other way, which is arrogant and condescending.
Really?
So you're straight on how this is gonna go down.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
Okay, okay, okay--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
I want you on call here.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Huh?
You love him?
He's a little spoiled, but I know he does.
You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
I've loved you ever since I first laid eyes on you, Jeremiah. I've just always been too scared to show it.
What are you, high?
What was that D.J.'s name again?
I have one question. How could a kid who wails on the drums like it's the only thing keeping him alive even think of such a femmy thing to say?
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
And when is she due back from that groinecologist's convention anyway?
The hypothetical temperature characterized by the absence of heat and even the slightest amount of molecular activity? Yeah, I'm vaguely familiar
Now, how are we gonna do this?
Four dudes sneaking in? We'd get busted fer sure. Bad plan.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
Cool.
Wait! I know how we can get in!
They're not idiots.
You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?
Yeah.
No.
That's some sick shit right there. Did she comb your ass hair for you too?
Twenty-five more'n I got.
Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.
Simple Simon on the Rock, go caller.
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
Good morning...
What was his name?
Yeah.
-- and be able to find one of these wormholes.
Like a spear that comes out of your stomach?
That... is highly unlikely. You're talking about an act of God.
Dea ex machina...
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
We went to a hotel.
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
You mean soap?
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
What happened to your neck?
Hey. You OK?
Did you call the cops?
I just don't get this. Everything can't be lumped into two categories. That's too simple.
Will you still be working at Yarn Barn? 'Cause that's a great place to raise children.
Do you get to meet Ed?
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
It was great. We had peanut-butter sandwiches and apples and honey at snacktime. And then during show-and- tell, my stuffed walrus was a big hit.
Oh, shit!
Is the death of one species less tragic than another?
Ms. Pomeroy... what's going on?
Thank you, Donnie. And you're a good student. Lazy... but a good student. Unlike most of the others, you question Mom and Dad's rules.
What about your family, Donnie?
I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
People get hurt.
Regret.
Then how is time travel possible?
What is going to happen?
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
He was a year ahead of us?
Excuse me... but what is the real issue here? The PTA doesn't ban books from school.
Please! Don't say those words.  Well... as you can see... many of us are devastated by this news. This is obviously some kind of conspiracy meant to destroy an innocent man. And I have taken it upon myself to spearhead the Jim Cunningham defence campaign. But unfortunately my civic duties have created a conflict of interest... which involves you.
Maybe Martha Moo finally went nuts and hijacked the bus.
We got eggs, water balloons, and a dozen rolls of toilet paper.
She's alive, sweetie.
That was your mom. She wanted you to have this.
No. It's pure bullshit, sweetie. You're lucky as hell, so you might as well enjoy it. Let's get you a root beer float.
What? For chrissakes, spit it out.
Amber? Here.
Lis, I want to, I really do, but... Oh, I can't.
They're from L.A. They wanted to see my room and film me for their movie.
Oh, c'mon... First the picture of Tammy, then Brett Clemens, now this? It's scary.
This, this... This is bullshit!
And the bite marks on my ears?
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Okay... well, bye.
Hi.
All right, they're makin' a movie.
Don't fall for it. She lives two trailers down.
That bitch from...
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Let's get this straight right now. We wouldn't have been late at all if it wasn't for you.
I want to get the big bag of little donuts.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
From what I have been gathering, I think they think I should be king: I think they think I should be king!
Here I am, Father.
"My dear President"...
That's what I wanted in the first place.  Tear it up and send it airmail.
I wonder what's keeping His Excellency?
Yes -- why?
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You're lucky I don't slap your face -- you oughtta be ashamed of yourself. Where did you hear that story?
You told it to me.
I'm glad I didn't ask you for "Washington Crossing the Delaware".
I can't do it...
Well, we gotta one hundred thousand men.
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
I bring you the greetings of my President and the good will of my people.
Your Excellency, haven't we met before?
Once more! 
In choosing you, I feel that I serve my country well.  I heartily endorse everything you stand for.
Why -- why -- of course.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
My purse has been stolen -- the plans of war are in it.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
With Mrs. Teasdale as my wife and Freedonia under my control -- 
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
Oh yes. You have so many nice things, and so much room.
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
They have noble faces.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
Hmmm?
But why did I do it? What was this all for? So John Merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? Or so I could become famous?
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
Don't!
What do you mean?
What happened?
Can't you fix him up here? ...He's my livelihood. Listen.
You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...
So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you!
Yes, I'm well aware of that. But this case is quite exceptional.
Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
Treves. Well done.
Can you imagine what his life has been like?
No, we don't. Their committees have informed me that they're unwilling to take Mr. Merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. They don't want him.
Has the response picked up?
But he's so afraid he's going to be carted off. I've promised him that won't happen.
O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de tramperies.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
Have you read it?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
You alright?
I meant no harm, it was the only place where I could find cardboard. I thought it has been thrown away.
What's this?
Yyess.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Say "Merrick".
Mmmerrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Well, it's a lovely bedroom. What do you call that thing above the bed?
...my... home?
Are you sure? Because I can take it back.
Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
Oh yes! It was wonderful!
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
No, he's very upset about something.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
You don't think it's too gaudy, do you.
Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
Who? Who? Whoever you've got in here of course!
WHAT did you say?
How d'you KNOW we're "friends"?
PLEASE! You don't know what you're doing!
Yes.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
What does that matter? But you've... you've... FELT like this before...
But you LOVED her all the same...
I've never LOVED anybody!
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
Five this week; how many the week before?
Halfdan the Black.
And thanks for the Cloak Invisible!
Then I shall come too.
How do we know this is the way?
Now what CAN you want with me, Erik the "Viking"?
And will the dead ever return, Freya?
No, no... It was very... er, nice.
I'll tell you what...
Oh, get it over with.
I just said I didn't feel like raping you.
You'll have to wait till he's finished his game.
I met this girl...
Faster!
What are YOU doing here?
What "magic" have you brought, Erik?
Because... you're... you're the Gods....
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Well, what else do we do?
Look, I bagged it last week.
She hasn't got any.
Sven!
Bye, Leif.
Vanish into thin air?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Who's that?
You just can't make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. You could charge Halfdan twenty and he'd pay it.
The Age of Ragnarok ends...
YOU do it!
Relax!
I should have got rid of you long ago!
I know, Dad.
So did my father and his father before him.
But it's a responsibility...
I must only let the red rage...
We're being attacked! KILL! Kill! Kill!
I must KILL! Kill!
Well, of course he is!
He drove me mad!
Well I'M certainly not, either.
You'll see my grandfather in Valhalla!
And keep your sword greased.
This is the night you met Clementine, Joel. I remember watching you walk down the beach with her and I thought, oh shit.
How are you today?
Okay, I guess.
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I like it.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
I can't remember.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
My name's Clementine, by the way.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Yeah.
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Take care.
Yeah?
Yeah, I guess.
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Thanks.
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Oh, yeah.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Tomorrow?
I don't want to talk about this here.
What if you hide me?
I want my mommy.  I don't want to lose you, Clem.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I scoured the city for it.
This is our first "date" date.
Right. Something black though.
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
I love her.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
Bye, Joel.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
I'm nervous, too.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
I don't know.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Yeah?
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
It was snowing.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
She's so sexy.
Yours?
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
How was it?
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
Very cool. Trippy.
Boo.
It's freezing out.
Yup.
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Thanks.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Is that Nietzsche?
Alexander Pope?
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
That's lovely.
I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately. I'm really sorry.
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
She likes you okay.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
I know, but where do you reside when you aren't visiting New York?
Tell me about it.
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Oh, you! I'm not talking about her hands. They're difficult to ignore, I confess, but I'm speaking of her whole being. Her whole being is extraordinary. The way she talks, for example. She's so articulate.
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
I'm cold.
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
A job for me?
That means top-secret, Cooper.
You can call him Baby-bear, he loves that...
The containment, Second Containment...
Will it work?
You been out there a long time. Trying to break my record?
What?
It's holding... She's holding...!
What's happening?
Let me breathe, let me breathe...
How? The Bridge is gone.
Of course not. Justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. Just one of those things.  I swore I'd never lose another man. I came close today. Real close.
I, I tried to go back for him, to save him, but I couldn't get to him in time. The fire... Have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? It's like a liquid, it slides over everything. It was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. And then he was gone.  I never told anyone until now. But this ship knew, DJ. It knows about the Goliath, it knows about Corrick. It knows our secrets. It knows what we're afraid of.  And now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.
Hear what?
What happened?
The official inquiry blamed Weir's design for the ship's loss.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
It won't stop, it goes on and on and on...
...It's inside and it eats and eats until there's nothing left.
Everything green on my boards, Skipper.
Justin.
This is Weir.
I can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, Dr. Weir, but it doesn't factor into this.
What's the hold up?
Jesus its huge.
I found one.
Peters...
...you okay?
I've been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach Neptune space.
No one?
What the hell is that? Dr. Weir?
Thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
To what? Where did this ship go? Where did you send it?
What about my ship?
I told you... She won't let you leave...
Your eyes...
...Make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
Proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we're right on top of it, we're gonna hit!
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Captain Miller, you copy?
We don't have time, Smith. In twenty hours we run out of air.
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there won't be a price? You already killed the first crew...
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Skipper...
Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
Crossing the horizon. Optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
...I ran the bio-scan with the DNA/RNA filter. The results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
Blow it up?
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
He's engaged the override.
What the hell is that?
The safety circuit's failed!
You can't do that.
Claire is your wife?
Yes.
I mean...
I can only stay for one drink, Ben. I've got to meet with Victor.
The suit will stretch. You should try it --
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Soon as I'm back, I'm gonna trade that in for a bigger rock.
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Five times.
Reed. Even you can't compute every little thing.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
Ben, I've been crunching the numbers on the machine. I think if we can rework the power settings...
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
I don't really know. A compound organic-metallic alloy. Stronger than titanium or carbon steel. Harder than diamonds --
What do you mean "complete"?
Now what is up with that?
Apparently I can disappear.
Sis. Let me take care of you for once.
Our numbers are through the roof. The IPO's tracking at fifty, sixty a share. The bank's five times oversubscribed --
How's the IPO?
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
It's not "invisibility" per se. You're bending the light around you with some kind of malleable force field. That's what you projected on the Bridge.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
When I walked out, I waited ten minutes outside your door. Ten. Waiting for you to come find me.
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?  Same old Reed, the hopeless optimist. Still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.
Raising the shields.
Please don't make this personal --
Brad, I really fuckin' hate McDonald's, man. Ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
It's the first door on your left!
This is how I dress all the time.
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
See you later.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
Dad says you're late again, you butthole!
Leave me alone.
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
You're a really good kisser.
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
I would. Yeah.
Of course something happens. You put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
Mark. What happened to your date?
Did you go home and get it?
The Attitude, Damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
Sensitive -- what is that?
Are you Linda Barrett?
How often do you go?
That's him! He did it!
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
So what did you do?
Was it great?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
Climax together.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
That little prick.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Yes.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
Well, you'll find out next year.
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
'The Cuer-vo Gold, the fi-ine Columbian.'  You look nice tonight.
Is this your first time?
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
I had a really nice time tonight.
I never thought it would happen at The Atlantis. Jeez.
No. That's okay.
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Look, you want to be gentle with that woman if she ever calls again. We're watching her very carefully... this woman has been into laudanum. It's a controlled experiment, but I suspect we'll need your cooperation before this thing is over.
They'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big Bowie knives. They might even sit on your wife's chest. Put the blade right down on her throat.
What?
We're your friends. We're not like the others.
Jesus! Did I say that?
He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't. He was lying to me.
Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out!
Shoot it.
OK. Lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. It's going to be a long walk. 
Did you see that? Some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.
Don't kid yourself. That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous. He's watching us like a hawk.
Where'd you get that knife?
Jesus Christ. I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
It just occurred to me, that she has no witnesses. Anything that she says about us is completely worthless.
As your attorney, I advise you to tell me where you put the goddamn mescaline.
Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Good work.  They'll treat us like goddamn lepers after that.
It's gone too far.
Sure. That's a good idea. One whiff of that shit would turn you into something out of a goddamn medical encyclopedia.
Yes!
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
How much is the lemon meringue pie?
What are you doing? You were supposed to turn back there!
Ridiculous! Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up. You never saw me before. Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles. I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate. You ready?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
We should go! We should go right now!
We shot a skunk.
And that's how I ended up here.
No, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. He didn't leave me. He just ran.  He just ran.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
I'm gonna shoot him if they don't get him first.
What?
I'm telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you're asking for it.
We gotta be close.
Yeah, the lot's right there. My truck is right out back.
It's imperative that you get that truck moving.
Oh, no.
Uh huh. Just put a dab on your tongue.
But --
My husband...
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
Four door?
Open?
How many?
Nine?
You young'uns worry about weapons, I'm thinkin' bout strategy.
Fine, Chief.
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
Move slow and move quiet.
Move it!
SHIT.
Yeah, maybe.
Yeah, I'll go.
Not without you!!!
I'm sure it wasn't me, it wasn't me...
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
I'm not!
Huh.
A rich actress.
In my eyes, officer.
I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
No?
What night?
I know you believe that.
Thanks, Dad.
I love you, Mama.  I love you, Dad.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
Please, Francie...
I'm going back to the hotel.
Kurt!
Address?
What?
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
Is it true you're getting a divorce? Comrade?
Yeah, well --
Don't be a rat, Harry.
Quietly.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
What're you gonna do, waste your talent? Why not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?
The chauffeur. He's watching.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Calm down, Frances.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
What for?
So you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
You know something, Harry?
To quarter-horses.
Huh?
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
I don't know.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
And no people.
Shit!
Did you expect him to look you up?
Fine!
What happened? Who're you?
Yes, Ma.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
I don't care.
Well, who have we here...?
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
Where are you going?
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
Don't I know you?
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
All right. Will you please sit down now?  Symington says.
You what?
Huh?
Is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
Friends? Do they live around here?
People can be kinder than you think.
The letters in your journal. That and a geography book.  Your Elizabeth sounds lovely.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Yes. I want this over and done with.
What kind of God is He to will this?
You make me weak.
I thought I'd never see you again!
It's not something I can explain now. Perhaps someday.
We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
Now you've got him started.
And here's to Him. Everything in moderation, Frankenstein.
They'll hang him all the same.
You're making a scene!
Mine and Professor Krempe's.  We've been trading off nursing you in shifts. The rest of the time we're out working with the cholera victims. It's his turn for that just now.
Everything in moderation, Clerval.
What happened up there?
Only if you'll tell me who he is.
All that I once loved lies in a shallow grave. By my hand.
But surely, Professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
Preposterous.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Your men are right to be afraid.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
And it's this place. It makes no sense, but it spooks me.
It sounded like Brenda.
Jack?
Sure.
Somebody'll see.
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
You saved my life.
I don't believe you...
Ha!
Ow!
Just a walk, for Chrissakes.
Ned!
I'm a little scared of storms. Always have been. Since I was a kid.
Umhummmmph.
You okay?
One night on the town.
I think water got into the electrical system. You ride me back to camp? I'll get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
What was that?
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?
I'm sorry to hear that. What were they, psychos?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Sorry, I need everybody.
Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that's biblical, ain't it? What am I askin' for, of course it is.  What are their names?
Where is the little lady?
How'd she die?
Is this real?
I think I've gotten about as up close and personal with you as I'm gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you need me, you're not gonna kill me 'cause I won't answer your stupid, prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.
Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be convinced about is that you're stuck in a situation with a coupla real mean motor scooters. I don't wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin' night. And I don't think you wanna be worrying about my brother's intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked at her, didn't ya?
Didn't think so. So, as I was saying, I'm willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don't try to escape. I'll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in the morning.
Why not, against your religion?
To your family.
In the Winnebago.
It's the bitterest of pills.
I just bet you would. Don't even think about it. Besides, I want to have one night's sleep in an honest- to-goodness bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they're not like a real bed.
What do you think Mom would say?
We have to go back for Daddy!
See ya.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
Yeah, and I'm gonna be right back at it tomorrow. So tonight I'm gonna sit in front of the box and just drink booze. How much is the bottle?
Richie? You okay?
These guys ain't spic firecracker salesman from Tijuana. They don't even know the meaning of the word "barter".  You wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It's scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary, you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.
Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.
I just want to go on record as saying this is a bad idea.
As long as you don't act like a fuckin' nut, we'll be just fine.
No, I didn't.
This ain't the time.
You okay?
Thank you, ensign.
I don't know if there's any single reason.  But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den.  It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!"  Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong.  Made me mad.  And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster.  "Gee, I wish I were a man."
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
"Security"?  What the hell you talkin' about?  Your base isn't secure?
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement.  I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
No, sir.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Think I overplayed it?
... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
Hardly the case, Senator.
California.
Jordan.  I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder?
You broke a dozen training rules back there -- before I lost count.
Chances of recovery?
Sorry.  But after our days...  So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Which is guy-speak for...
So why are you telling me this?
Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I'd sure like to know who.
I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Do you, uh, know...
England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant.
I think you're the liar.
Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over.
Well, who the shit you think you are?  Comin' in here like that?
Can't live with them, can't kill them.  What's the point?
The Navy?  They've made it clear they don't want to pull missiles out of subs to make room for women's heads.  What's it gonna cost to make a fleet of Trident's co-ed?
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Christ, I don't want to see her take a fall.  She thinks I do, but...
What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
Nice guys finish last. First rule of the jungle.
What are you doing?
What are you talking about? The east side is always faster.
Audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you.
Wish me luck!
Can I use some?
I can't.
We did it! We've got the exclusive! Way to go, Audrey!
No. Perhaps I work too much.
Christ. How many tunnels lead off the island?
You're fast.
Well your people are getting in the way of my job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the Chernobyl earthworm?
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
What sample?
But there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? Is there?
We think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
Last time you didn't even scratch it!
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Do I know you?
I need you to trust me.
How do I do that?
Is that the bathroom?
Not so bad. We'll get you to medical quarters. You're going to be fine.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
You WILL go out there.
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
Fred's no good, Jason. You're going to have to kill it
He wants to THINK!?
You know, with the makeup and everything1 I actually thought he was smart for a second.
Why didn't you stop at the market?
You said "the Commander.
Yes but, we were wondering-
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
What do you mean?
But you don't?
How did you come to that conclusion?
No, wait, are you-
I'm at the control oaneh. What do I do?
That's It?
Fred, I worked summer stock with Hopkins. Regional theater with Hoffman. But I swear to God I have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a Freddy Kwan. You're Mr. Dependable... You can do this.
Listen, I was wondering, would you guys mind if I sit in today? See if anybody's interested in an autograph? Never know.
It's... I don't know.
That's it, that's what's going to kill me.
It's Jason...
Only answers to me.
We have no right to do this. They deserve to know.
There's nobody here. Jason...
Yeah. But I've got Gorignak staring me in the face. I think I can take it though...
Wait, the pig lizard is gone. Why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
Because it was on the show!
never doubted you for a second.
You should have let me hit him.
Yes.
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
Stop, please! I don't know!
No! I swear I don't know! Please!
NO, Thank God he has not.
Former Commander?
I'm not a Commander, there is no National Space Exploration Administration. There is no snip.
How about the pig-lizard?
Hold course, Laredo!
Continue forward, sir?
Lieutenant Lathe, I confess I am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. Chasing across the universe to obtain what is, I am now certain, a bauble of fiction. Tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? I would like nothing to remain.
You'd have to travel hundreds of miles through the wilderness.
Is that a fact.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
While they're strung out?
They're ready.  Believe me, the ones that stayed on here at Valley Forge are ready for anything.  Of course, we get nothing from Congress.  They need boots, coats... we desperately need food.
Gates?  He used my battle plan and I humbly submit that without me he'd still be back at Saratoga waiting for the British to attack.  George, why haven't you moved into the Potts' house back at the creek? Much more befitting of a Commander and Chief than your field tent. And... you could entertain.  I think you need to entertain more. Seriously!  Get a few New Jersey whores up here, invite some Congressmen... couldn't hurt.
You've served me loyally, year after year, without complaining. I've thought hard about you this past winter.  I want to free you, Wil.  I want to give you your freedom, after this battle is fought.
Yes, general.
General Lee, welcome back.  I'm happy you've decided to join us.
They're among the best divisions the British have.  No conscripts, no impressed recruits, just professional killers.
I must tell you sir you treat me with disrespect!
He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress.  George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America.  Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne!  George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
I'm not sure.
Good day, Mister Adams... George, what's the word from Boston?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
Unofficially, General Greene.
My God... They mean to finish us. What about Arnold?  He's up there.
But the Hessians are there!  No one can beat them!  That's why Cornwallis stationed them there! They have the post of honor!  They are invincible!
They help me understand why we fight.
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
'Continentals', Congress' paper money.  It was worthless to start with, but as you see, counter feiters have made them even less than worthless.  Can you tell which one is fake?
I rode here, on my horse.
My God, what?
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
Yes, yes, happy to meet you.
I certainly didn't mean you.  Of course you are a gentleman, an officer and a gentleman.
They're just disgusting, jealous, bottom-feeding swine.  It's their nature.
If the constitution is ratified... we'll have a country.  They'll want to elect you president of the convention, which means president of the country.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children.  You won't have to do anything at all!  You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
And what is this, then?  Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot?  Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Is it?  William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial?  I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Then why are you teaching me...?
Yes!
That?  I hear a mob:  unemployed, drunkards, vagabonds... the world's dregs.
For God sake, get that horrid stuff off your face.  You look like a damned slave!  It's damned humiliating.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
Her mother. Not that it matters because I don't work for you no more. I quit. I just wanted to come by, tell you to your face so there's no misunderstanding.
Remember Harry's story about the dry cleaner Palmer was after? Guy who stole the three hundred grand from the airline?
He's around someplace.
No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
You know how to write one of these?
I really think I can be of service on this one.
She's great. Gimme the money.
He was watching Letterman, huh? Sneaky, that Chili Palmer.  So, he ever find this dry cleaner, the one with all that money on him?
I'm already in town, but it don't matter. We got dick in the bank. We dumped it all in Harry's movie.
Who is this?
Who is this? I'm the one telling you the way it is, okay, asshole? That's who I am. Now you want your three hundred grand or don't you?
I work for Harry Zimm, alright?
Who?
Or else what?
Where's Leo Devoe? Where's Chili Palmer? Where's my fuckin' money?
That's right.
I'm a producer.
Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
I said I had an idea, that's all.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
I'm not the guy, Harry.
He drown?
That, or I'm thinking what if some tragic accident were to befall the widow Saffrin -–
Yeah, Ray, he personally told me he got killed in that Get Away Airlines' jet went down last month.
'E.g.' means 'for example', Ray. I think what you wanna say is 'i.e.'
So you don't know what I'm thinking.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
I believe it.
They report it to the IRS.
Who told you that?
It was Fay, wasn't it, told you about the money. She tell you my whole life history, for Christ's sake?
But you won't know where I am. I don't even know where I'll be.
That's right. Three percent.
For any movie.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
You been here the whole time?
I want to know.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Well actually, Martin the movie we came to talk about is Mr. Lovejoy.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
No. I don't mean that. I just meant in general.
Harry... My God...
What kinda food they serve at this Ivy place anyway?
You don't act like it?
That's what the guy said.
Pick 'n' Save.
Harry, what're you still doing with those guys?
Which two?
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Damn mind of it's own.
One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up.  An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire.
When they find out what it's carrying, they may not be so interested in what's legal.
The turbine blew.
What?
Maureen.
Last thing we want is extra partners.
What other choices have we got?
I'm no doctor. But I'd say he's in a coma.
What the hell would a freighter be doing up here? It's way out of the lanes. There's not a port for 800 miles.
I thought you said it was just a blade.
Like I always say --
How long, then?
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs.
I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
What the hell happened!
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
Could be a fishing boat.
You mean, before she sank.
Then why didn't they take it.
Stay away. Or else.
No.
Go on.
You're more practical than superstitious.
Of course I'm sure. I saw him.
Guess that'd be me. Again.
Just before I heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
Greer?
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
But where's the damage?
Showing you what?
You killed them.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
I didn't want it to turn out this way.
Yeah.
You're up late.
How much you figure that's worth, skipper?
I don't know.
I say we off-load some of that gold now.
Ho-ly shit.
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan.
You're kidding, right?
Who?
Give up?
Not the Maxine?
Here we are... it's mocha mint from Lickety Splits. Oh, isn't that photograph just heart-rending?
Oh -- please - don't let me interrupt finish your phone call.
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
And what can you tell us about this... 
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
Well, yes...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Look, we don't pay you to be a movie critic -- just do your job.
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Do you want something to drink?
Yeah, right...
Nothing.
Yeah, well --
You must have known all along how I -- you know -- how I felt about you -- it must be totally obvious...  God... I always used to dream about this...
Oh, hi...
Do you want to go get breakfast somewhere?
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
You can have that one.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
What is this?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
He's insane!
Just promise you'll do it.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
You won't believe it! Guess!
No way... when?
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're just jealous.
...maybe we should be lesbos...
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
God, you're really obsessed...
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
Well I'm going to major in Business Administration and, I think, minor in Communications.
Nothing.
What are you doing here, Melorra?
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
That's five hundred dollars.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Sure, I guess.
Is this one any good?
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
Oh, right...
Good luck...
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
I brought it for him to autograph. He's going to be amazed to see it - it's one of two known copies... I can't believe they have him for the opening act and not the headliner. What an insult!
What did you tell that girl?
You can open your eyes now.
Are you okay?
Then again, that's easy for me to say, since I'll never even get a date. I'm sure you have hundreds of guys who are interested in you.
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Never mind, it's way too complicated...  Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Oh... pretty well, surprisingly... you know...
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
So, do you like me, Seymour?
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
Yeah, sure. Of course.
So where would we go?
...Do you really want us to drive away somewhere?
I-I never expected anything like this to happen...
Seymour? You gotta be kidding me!
Let me tell ya somethin', Joe... Listen to me, Joe... you can't hit a home run without swinging the bat!
Yeah.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
I don't know.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
I am a man of peace.
My wife is the game player in the family, sir.
You've never built in Africa.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
It's what the natives are calling the lions-  -two lions have been causing trouble-
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
That's a terrible idea-
Oh dear-  -you're geting that downtrodden look again-
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
We have hunted since childhood.
Might be exciting for you.
John, it will not be easy.
I didn't have a chance to thank you.
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
It was probably luck- I'd rather you did the shooting.
But of course yours worked.
It would have been a beautiful bridge, John. I never noticed before, occupied with other business, I	suppose...  ...never really pay much attention to that kind of thing but I've had the time today, nothing else on, and this... it's graceful and the placement couldn't be prettier... and... 
Their den?  Have you ever seen anything like this?
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
I expect so- it's from my wife.
Soon. 
Oh yes. But it takes time.
How many cattle?
Gentlemen, there's no sickness smell at all here, and little blood. When we leave, close the gate securely, don't open it til morning and keep your fires high. Any questions, ask them now.  You two will sleep beautifully in your tents.  And stay there.
I'm sorry.  Perhaps some other time.
Do you need anything?  You want me to come in?
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
This is my address and telephone number. Will you call me?
Frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
You're also a human being, Frank.
Hiya, Oscar.  What do you say, slugger?
Peter, this is serious.  I need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
Please don't say that.  You won't go to prison.
I may be wrong, but I think you've got a little crush on this guy.
Good-bye, Peter.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
Oh, Peter, I didn't dump you.  I just had to protect myself.  You really weren't very good for me, you know.
So why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
According to my sources, the world will end on February 14, in the year 2016.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
It may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the Holiday Inn.  I can't be sure, Peter.
Well, good night, Louis.
I can't believe a person could actually live like this.
I don't think we should leave her alone.
Oh, yeah, sure -- no.  But there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
It must be the chemical fumes in the studio. People start imagining things --
The witness is leading him.  Sustained.
I thought you were like the fifth Ghostbuster.
I predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve.
I'll ask you again, Dr. Venkman.  Why were you digging the hole?  And please remember that you're under oath.
Egon!
How've you been?  How's teaching?  I bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
Who was that?
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
You know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
This is an incredible breakthrough, Venkman. A psychoreactive substance!  Whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
Don't tell me, let me guess.  All-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the Sizzler?
I'll keep to the middle of the channel. We're okay to 59th Street, then we'll go ashore and take First Avenue to 79th.
My Fault!
Are you telling me how to drive?
Is it a star?
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
We're all professionals here, Miss ...
Why would anyone make up a thing like that?
Is that your professional opinion?
Have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
Uh-huh.
On a purely scientific basis.
I'll scream.
Hittites,  the Mesopotamians and the Sumerians.  "Zuul was the Minion of Gozer."
You think I enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I'm making an exception because I respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
We must prepare for the coming of Gozer.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
That is one speedy mutt.
Print is dead.
In the physical sense.
I don't believe in luck.
Exactly what are you a doctor of, Mr. Venkman?
You could say that.
I'm not at liberty to say.
Go ahead!  Get a court order.  Then I'm gonna sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
Hey, Mister!  Can I see those guns?
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
On Earth -- no.  But on Krypton we could slice him up like Oscar Mayer Bologna.
Oh, this is big, Peter.  This is very big. There's definitely something here.
Wait!  Wait!  There's something I forgot to tell you.
I'm with Dana Barrett and she's floating three feet off the bed.
Does she want to be?
I just realized something.  We've never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
I've got to sleep.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
If you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, I think I could win the Nobel Prize.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
This is like a major disgrace.  Forget M.I.T. or Stanford now ... they wouldn't touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
My parents left me that house, I was born there.
They will.
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Third floor.  Get down here,
I guess they don't build them like they used to, huh?
As a duly-constituted representative of the City of New York, and on behalf of the County and State of New York, the United States of America, the Planet Earth and all its inhabitants, I hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
Quite so.  Narcissus and his courageous men; may they live long to serve Rome...
You're coming back?
Now that is a happy sound! Tomorrow, I want the citizens -- my people -- back in the arena.  The Gods know, I'm tired.  Come to bed, now; tonight we're celebrating.
Yes?  Go on!
I back Rome against all her enemies -- if that answer disappoints you, I'm not a politician...
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
The Senate is out to sink you.  I swear it, Caesar, your generosity is being repaid with public attacks on your honor.  Your enemies want you weak enough so by the first of Janus when you must be confirmed the Senate will be able to deny you.
Cos, what in hades is the emperor up to?  And don't tell me you don't know!
You know, general, there is a Gate of Janus in Rome which is only closed in time of peace.  Sadly, it has remained open for three hundred years.
I would venture, with all respect: the Emperor's health is the business of every soul in the empire.
The trouble is defining exactly what 'right' is.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I made the plume from a quail feather.
I see the emperor's little boy has finally caught up with the army.
You're a legate in the Roman army. Huh...?  and you act like one. What was your crime?
Take your hands off me animal!
Sorry but I have to get at least one fight out of you otherwise I won't even get back the cost of the bribe I had to pay the arena slaves to get you here.  I know what you're trying to do:  kill yourself and trust in the Roman tradition of justice that the emperor will let your family survive and keep their lands.  The only thing you have accomplishes is to prove you're a very important individual.  You make me feel good about my investment!  And that puking pig Jerses -- he won't even discuss you.  Both of you have clamped mouths!  But I love all my fighters -- I'll find out about your family.  And about you.  That I promise.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
I'm not a gladiator.  I refuse to fight.
No more bad luck now!  The people are anticipating you!  I have posters up over half the city advertising you as the great warrior -- the true Roman!  The man who fought side by side with the wolf of Rome!
The point is you get to fight the easy country circuit, the small arenas, relax, live the good life!
But -- you have to go out there! I'll give you more than your one third!  When I get paid... just take the fall!  You're too hurt to fight and the man's a killer!
No.
Do you want some dinner?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Elaine --
I'm meeting someone.
No.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
What do you think?
Elaine -- I love you.
Don't tell me --
My belt.
No.
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Why do you have to see him?
No, Benjamin.
Yes, I will.
What are you then?
Oh -- no sir.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
I'm putting it here by the door.
Hello.
What?
Do you have any luggage, Mister --  Gladstone?
Oh no.
Is there an ashtray in here?
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
Will you come in, please?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
What do you think?
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Thank you.
What are you so scared of?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Jesus Christ!
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Now?
Why don't you get it.
Yes?
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes?
Wood or wire? They have both.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Are you afraid of me?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Who said it was my first time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
Well what do you want to talk about?
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Neither.
Can I take off my clothes now?
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
About five years.
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Is it?
I don't.
Why did you do that?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What was your major?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
What?
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
But if it's sickening for you --
Thank you.  Benjamin --
Mrs. Robinson --
Go home now.
What have you done to her?
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Braddock -- Braddock?
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Not if you don't want to.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
I guess -- about my future.
I don't know. I want it to be --
You got me.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Say that again.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
Ben, can I say something to you?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
You miss the point.
HUH?
Benjamin -- where are you?
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
I don't believe it.
Have you a minute now?
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
Why?
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
Where downstairs?
You're very funny --
Chasing what?
Would you like to make a man happy?
Why?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
You live here?
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Yes -- tired...
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Am I quite strange to you?
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
Yes -- I do understand.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
Why do you smile?
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
No?
I don't want them now.
I'll not denounce you.
So --
You do believe that I really love you?
When are you leaving Berlin?
Why?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
The Baron is tired?
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
The Grand Hotel.
Everything?
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Oh, don't go.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
You're trembling.
You dance splendidly.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Money!
Do you like me better?
Moreover...
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters. 
Miss Flaemm.
Sit here.  Cognac -- for you?
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
What?
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Madam has slept well?
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
I could not think of not accepting.
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
Yes, the police must be called.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
We will wait.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
Bobo, no, I --
Motherhood.
You're calling the shots.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Not skimming a thing, Lilly?
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Come take a look. An entire-suite of main-frame computer.
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Kaggs. Home office.
You're right. I apologize. But I still want to talk to you.
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Perk, remember?
A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
They knocked out my tooth!
Thanks, uh, Lilly.
It's there. The boss called, you said so yourself.
Why?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I just came back from Phoenix.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
I thought you'd be happy for me. After all, you --
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
I don't see why not.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I didn't teach you that.
You're too young. You should be in school.
Are you sure?
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
Every day in every way.
You talk the lingo. What's your pitch?
Is that right?
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
Take a hike, you mean?
Things a man isn't supposed to know.
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
But the setup's there. It's there now.
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
That's natural.
I'm sorry, it was her all right. Her gun, even.
It may be Lilly, but it isn't suicide.
Not that it matters.  This is the morgue?
We never know when and we never know why. We never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it'll be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you've got tickets to the World Series. And that's the way the permanent waves.
Why am I here?
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
Pamela Whittington was a long time associate of Dr. Loomis.  Her home office was ransacked.  It was chock full of Loomis' files on Meyers.  It'd say that makes Meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
That's it?
Care to join me?
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
No shit?!
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Oh, so now it's my fault?
Wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me Michael Meyers is my uncle?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
Can I come in?
It's John, isn't it?
A box of fortune cookies... I'm running out of advice.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Where's Shane?
He do that to you?
Why?  You interested?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Isn't he that psycho who's been spying on my sister?
Guess they -- went to the fair after all.
Answer what?
I'm getting the children out of here. At least until we know what we're dealing with.  John, I want you to come with us.
He crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  His sister's room. Right here. Where it all began.
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
Come on!
As always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  And you're right.  I've come to celebrate.  After thirty-two years as Psychiatric Administrator, guess who has been named Smith's Groves new Chief of Staff.
But surely Rogers isn't --
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Come now, Sam.  This is a gathering of old friends.  I know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I'm in charge I felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  After all, you're the only one around here who's still in the dark, as it were.  This isn't the way I wanted to tell you, but you've really given me no other choice.
Yes ... Tommy.  What are you doing here?
Run, Tommy!!!  Run!!!
Hm?
Can I have the Cadillac?
When I drive it, I feel like I'm in the middle of a great big wad of bubblegum.  I don't hear anything, I don't feel anything.  I figure somebody else is driving.  It's a bitch.
You know what gets me?
I'm certainly not going to come horning back into your life tomorrow, and I will not welcome your horning back into mine.  A chapter has ended.  We are old comrades--at a parting of the ways.
And how were things?
The educational process.
So, kid--how they hanging?  Or don't you say that to a little kid?
Sorry.  At least you've got a place to come back to.  I don't have a place to come back to anymore.
I didn't like that violin thing. That was sad.
Yeah.  I practically forgot.  But after you busted that thing, I got to thinking, "Jesus--maybe I'll start the violin again." That didn't just belong to Woodly.  That belonged to everybody.  Maybe he would have sold it to me, and I could have some fun.  After you busted the violin, boy, and Penelope walked out, I thought to myself, "Jesus--who could blame her?"
You're an imbecile.
Yeah, Jesus--but wars would be a lot better, I think, if guys would say to themselves sometimes, "Jesus--I'm not going to do that to the enemy.  That's too much." You could have been the manufacturer of that violin there, even though you don't know how to make a violin, just by not busting it up.  I could have been the father of all those people in Nagasaki, and the mother, too, just by not dropping the bomb.  I sent 'em to Heaven instead--and I don't think there is one.
How are you, honeybunch?
What you say is, "Pass the fucking catsup."
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
You're my buddy.
It makes life spicy.
Aha!  He has a brilliant military record, I'm sure.
England?
"The sting."
Sir?
I wanted to go out for football, but Mom was afraid I'd get hurt.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Eighteen--  and a half.
Yes, sir.  It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be.  And what to drink?
Not at all.
You were well adjusted to my being dead?
Bluh.
We thought it was an emergency.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
Please--
I have some change!
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
Honeymoon temporarily canceled.  The boy should still go out and exercise.  I have the impression he never gets any exercise.  He simply bloats himself with Fig Newtons and bakes his brains over steam radiators.
It couldn't!
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
I learned a lot of things in college.  Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
I came for Paul as well.
About a broomstick and a cigar box--and the attenuated intestines of an alley cat.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
Blue soup?
I don't know.  I hope he never hunts.  I hope he never kills another human being.
All right!  Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Norbert--you come, too.  Let him go, Harold.  Let him go.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
But here you are inside, aren't you?
Look--this isn't my apartment, and there isn't anybody else here.  Mrs. Ryan won't be home for a while.
She's fine.  Please--
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
How was the emergency, Doctor? Profitable, I hope.
Are--are you crying, Penelope?
What next?  You leave promptly, of course.  There is no question as to whose home this is--
Colonel Harper and I once shared a treetop with a family of bats. There was a flash flood.  There were piranha fish in the water. That's how Colonel Harper lost his little toe.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
Now who's being cruel?
You're a clown.  You're a clown who kills--but you're a clown.
This is going to become very physical.  Are you prepared for that?
King Arthur.
Poison.
Don Quixote.
Get up.
Somewhere in this city.  Not here, not here.  Tell Penelope I loved her--in my clownish way.  And Paul. Tell him to be a healer, by all means.
Use the sanitary facilities, if I may.
Alice got married again.
Alice is dead?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
What happened?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
You want to join the Harold Ryan Fan Club?  Wear a pink jacket with a yellow streak up the back?
Premature ejaculation.
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
Don't touch me.  Get out of the way.
That goes double for me.
I'll kill myself.
Wouldn't you rather have your mother marry me than him?
He's coming back, Mom!  He's the bravest, most wonderful man who ever lived.
Stay home tonight!
A what kind of doctor?
I hate that thing.
Yes, he is.
Really?
Then get him.
I'm glad.
If you want to wrestle, you got Lehigh.  If you want to play tennis, you go to Vanderbilt.
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Yeah.
Is he all right?
Is he coming home?
How long has this been going on?
I'm saying no--and thank you.
You were wonderful.
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
After this explosion, I think, he'll be able to accept the fact that his mother is going to marry again.
What kind of a life is that?
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
To show myself how brave I am.  The issue's in doubt, you know--since I'm always for peace--
Get out of here.
What a beautiful demonstration this is of the utter necessity of rites of passage.
I heard you the first time. We had nothing to go on with this kid. Just a runaway.  Do you really think he's in danger?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
You're still dressed?
There's a girl I want to ask you about.
Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
That's cool.
Wait?
I'd like to place a 'Personals' ad in the Free Press.
How many weeks?
Just one.
Is this all the display space we can get?
I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.
Mr. Van Dorn, I've worked on the color scheme for weeks. I think it's just right.
Are you still going with that fella that teaches at Grand Valley?
Kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
No.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
You making a feature?
Where is she?
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
They were here?
He deals in pain.
Christian Reformed. It's a Dutch Calvinist denomination.
I can stop if you want.
Where does he live.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
But what?
Why do you say that?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Andy.
Hey, I'm a private detective, Van Dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I've been to that scumbag town. It's full of them.
In G.R.? Why?
What do you mean?
No.
No.
Yeah.  All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.
I don't know.
I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I did to you -- not that I did anything wrong -- that I kept investigating, poking around. There's some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
What happened, pilgrim?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Is Marsha there?
I think I've found a way to find Kristen. I have a plan. But I have to be alone.
Rucker.
I want to know where my daughter is. Her name is Kristen, or Joanne. She's with you.
Fifty cents admission.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What exactly do you have in mind?
It's an investment.
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
Hold it, mister.
I'm off that case. He fired me.
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
No.
Hello, I'm Candy Gulf.
Eh, Poli Sci?
Yes.
Lady, let me get this straight.
Officer, I can explain.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
This way, Edith. Harold is out by the garage. He has a new car and he has been tuning it up. He's very mechanical.
Sorry I'm late.
Eh, no.
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Your hearse?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Look.
It is kind of rough.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
Well, I really don't smoke.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
You are the wisest person I know.
I like you, Maude.
It's so blue.
Pray? No.  I communicate. 
No. I'd feel stupid.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Maude, I must speak to you.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
How about some candy floss?
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
Harold, please! I'm on the phone.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
This is insane.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
No.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
No.
No.
You liked your teachers?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Jeez! That's a great story,
Oh sure.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
How about to slit his throat?
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh yes. That's fine.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
It's different for us.
Frank.
So... You're Kirsty, huh?
Get out of the way.
Kyle, you don't have...
Well... G'bye.
Then why are you here?
Easy, easy. Whatever happened, whatever you saw, it's not here now.
What a load of crap. Hell, a week ago I hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
C'mon -- Rasputin??
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
Every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. I'm running out of lies, Trevor.
Reliquary --
On the desk, yes. In Latin.
C'mon, champ. You look a little woozy, there.
Grounded? Who's grounded?
His horns. He files 'em. To "fit in."
Sir, may I go first??
That's what you do. That's why we need you. You have an insight.  You know monsters.
In the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
Those things never work. Never.
Helping you -- I just --
I just fried Stinky. Tell Father I'll be home. He shouldn't wait up.
No. Stop. Don't do this -- Listen to me -- Tell me where you are --
What took you so long?
No. I never was.
You want me to hold him down?
Myers, you're a talker. What's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
Doesn't sounds like him.
No... He's determined. Unstoppable --
What -- ?
-- Late. Five minutes late.
Look, do you want the bed in or not?
You did this before, right?
Nobody escapes us.
We want the man who did this --
Please. Get back into bed.
That's easily arranged. But first, back into bed.
Kirsty. It's Frank. It's Uncle Frank.
This isn't happening.
Who are you?
And you came back here to solve the puzzle --
Who did?
I don't.
Maybe we should just leave --
Kirsty? It's very late.
Where's Daddy?
Like who?
Well?
Julia?
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Who was it?
I don't know where to begin...
Let's keep it that way, shall we?
I do. I'd just feel happier if you were with us.
You will keep in touch.
O.K.
Take care, Dad.
Big house.
Are you O.K.?
Yeah.
Really?
No. It's all over.
Need any help?
Oh!
If I make it through the day.
What did I say?
'Bye.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon.  You should get out of bed earlier.
Play it.
We can take your car.
What do you mean, "what?"
Okay.  Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Fine by me.  I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
What band?
Great.  Can I have it then?
I have all of the others.
They always seemed...
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
Anna Moss.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
What are you talking about?
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Yeah.  A billion.  Right... How are you?
There's been a rash of them, recently. I find it a little unnerving.  In fact Marco called a few months back, and he wanted to see me, and rehash the past as they say, and I wasn't really up for it.  Do all men go through this?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
I understand, Dick.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
It's Vince and Justin.
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Good.  So shall we leave it at that then?
Jeez.  He goes on long enough.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
And do you like it that way?
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What?
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Is it better?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
Hello.
Are you still in love with me?
You still together?  Going all right?
You know I'm a good person.
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
Pig died.
I'm sorry.
You're soaking.
What?
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
How?  How were we the same people?
But what?
Hi.  What are you doing?
Wanna go to dinner?
Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.
WHAT?
About what?
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
Is Ray going?
Hi, Marie.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
You know that's not what's upsetting me.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Seventy-five.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
Wait a minute.  Island Records charged U2 a million five against their overhead for one plane ride.
I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967.  And the guys rich.  You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Mr. Congeniality?  Let him find his own clues.  There's a journal article in this somewhere.
Scottish claymore.  Take a French epee, add twenty pounds of ballast so it means business, and you've got a claymore.
Well, this is a small town, and it was even smaller then.  Most all the babies I delivered were from local families.  Richard's parents were just passing through when his mother's time came.  I did it right here at the house.
The boy _died_?
Have you taken to touring small town cemetaries, Miss Cartwright?
At the moment?  Carl Smith.
Not your concern.
That bothers you?
I'd rather hear yours.
Is this what you killed them with?
When you finish, what then?
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
You are a very perceptive young woman.
That would be difficult to explain.
He knows about you.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
No!
The inheritance.
Thanks.
Just for laughs we raided wonder boy's house.  There was a gallon of one of the corpse's blood in his carpet.  I think it was about then I withdrew his name for humanitarian of the year.
Research.  If your pal was there I never saw him.
Some job.  Card filing and cabinet dusting.  Four years in this dump and I haven't written anything for Wilson that a wounded yak couldn't do.
What are you doing man?
I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
You Scots have a way with game.  It still has life in it. Spirit.  Back home the food is so...domestic.
You're a long way from Inverness.
When I was a boy a cart driven by a drunken fool crushed me.  All thought I would die or be maimed for life.  But I healed quickly. And like you I paid the price for being different.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
I'm twenty-two.
You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
Aye.
Why?
You're no match for Scot, Mr. Romirez.  We're raised as riders.
Eat up Dupont.  It will probably be your last.
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
We have no understanding.
Help?  I've seen others "help". Somehow a head always ended up on the counter.
Stay out of it.
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
And the Bulgarian?
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
But then rides up Pope Pius who calmly brushes the dust from his papal cross, climbs off his papal horse, draws his papal sword and asks just what the hell is going on.  And what did Neuvich, dear dear drunken Neuvich do?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
You disappoint me.  I thought you'd finally gotten over that sort of thing.
This your present address?
Mr.-  Taupin, what were you doing in that alley?
Did you know the victim?
A mystery.
The resemblance is amazing.
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns?
I'll keep you in mind.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Mr. Burns --
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Mother? But your mother --
No. My mother.
Just for the first year.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
Save that for the Tribune.
What do you want?
How long is what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
What?!!
You've had a better offer, eh?
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Sweeney.
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
Get away, Svengali.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I'd like to think.
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
All the words you've got.
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Ring that number, will you?
Murder, uh?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
Where'd you wire him?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Walter!
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind?
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Boy, did you see her go?
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Gus, this --
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
Take your paws off me!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
After all I've done for you --
Sssh. Wait, Fred.  What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
There goes another scrub lady.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Mother!
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
A gun?  Why -- to shoot, of course.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
What's that?
Hey --
What do you want?
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
Who? Me?
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
You mean here in the city?
I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
Well, well -- Miss Mollie Malloy.
There she is!
Never let a rat creep up on you.
But Grandpa, you said...
What are you doing here? This is our territory
You want to join our gang?
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
Won't they have maps?
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
Who with?
Can't we just see the end?
Mind that shrapnel DAWN thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in BILL'S face.
Well. Now we can do it slow. Are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
...It was a toss-up. His company went to India, mine went to France. Flip of a coin.
What's that?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
Did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, Grace?
It's all better left unsaid, Grace.
You might still have a house.
To Mary McDonald, Thelma Richardson, Bobo Hinds, Lily Sanderson...  ...Little Sarah Whats-it, now there was a spirit. And Marjorie Anderson.
What can you do with four daughters, I asked myself, A string quartet was all I could come up with. They hated me for making them learn.
I don't know how you cope, Grace. Three kids, army pay. On your own.
Whoa, thanks for stopping. I been standing out there in that toad strangling rain for like a hundred million years.
Tiny's home.
What about R.J.?
Ma, Tiny's in.
Drink up, it's party time.
Is your brother ready to go?
Um, yeah sure, I guess.
Mmmmm, this is tasty.
I was just wondering.
You know... a couple of queers.
He walks, duh.
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
The Duke?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
Hell, boy there some other Duke you know about?  A great American.
Better than pissing... anyway so, what's your choice?
Yeah, I guess... hot chicks are always nuts.
Keep straight on this road here.
It's a hitchhiker.
Oh yeah, I heard about that. I always thought it was bullshit.
I like sleep.
Hey, he moved.
Forget it. I'll just go.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Hmmmmm.
Worse than a fucking rabid baboon.
Goddamn.
Huh? Oh, hi. You really don't have a phone?
You'll have to forgive Tiny, he can't hear so much.
Oh, yeah.
Now she was put in the nuthouse in 1930 at the age of 16.
You gotta be kidding me. This chick is wasted.
We've got get out of here, we got get out of here.
Hello...  ...hey Denise... what, what's wrong, did you break down?
Don't even say it.
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
For the show. It's Halloween eve and time for our show.
Just back up.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
Please, could I please come in and talk to you for a minute? Maybe you could take a better look at the picture... might stir up something.
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I don't know. I only saw one.
What should I do?
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Yeah, well I guess it's tough to sit on the sidelines and wait when your own kid's missing... besides, ain't no such thing as an ex-cop.
Well, don't jump down my throat. I'm just trying to help.
Look, if you're going to be like that... You should be appreciative that I'm interested.
French?
Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay?
Oh, Hi, Gabrielle.
Of course not.
Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle.
Gabrielle. No, I'm sorry if I startled you. I came to think.  God, Did I hang up on you?
Our...? Oh!  He seems fine. I guess we woke him. The lights and all.
Oui.
Isn't Puff doing spectacularly, honey?
My little French.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person.
No. You look so beautiful.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts!  I love you, Gabrielle.
I'm going alone. This could be dangerous.
My apologies, madam.
We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
And I think I'm going to.
Lila, it's Rosie.
Oh, Rosie.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
I'm sorry that I became so upset.
You do?
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I'll be out in a minute.
I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature.
Do you?
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do.
Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Who is it?
Don't quibble. You know what I mean.
Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female.
Everything's fine, honey. We don't need to talk. Besides I have to work late.
Of course not.
That's great.
Oh!  I didn't see you there, sneaky boy!  You're like a boy sneaking in...
Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied?
Have you?
Really?
How come?
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Bravo to you, Puff!
You were gone a long time.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Look at you two. You both disgust me.
Yep.
Thanks. Sure is a hot day for driving. Late afternoon is better. You guys have plenty of time. Make Pittsburgh in two, maybe three hours.
About sixty, seventy bucks.
To win.
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
Pool.
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Whaddya been so far?
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
So does Eddie.
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Aaaahhhh!
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
He's my partner.
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
Well... well, now.
It's quiet.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Just like that?
Glad to meet you.
There it is. I'm broke.
What's the limit?
Couple of bucks.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
You wanna raise the bet? Two on the five, five on the nine?
You better not miss, friend.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
You don't look like a college girl.
What do you do on the other days?
I could always get us a bottle.
At school. It's Thursday.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
Mm hmm.
You got it all in your head?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Give it to me.
Who is it?
A loser?
He's a gambler.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
Game's over, Eddie.
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings.  What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Was this -- "beautiful?"  Before?
What's inside?
Emma...
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
That sounds charming.  What are you planning to do tomorrow?
Is the hill ours too?
If we want it, it is.
It's got a name.  Copper Ridge. There used to be a copper mine near here.
There are more this year than last.
It was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Where's your car?
I'm home now.
I don't know what he's told you --  What <u>has</u> he told you?  Would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
No.
Yes.  I can even read star maps.
Where, Jimmy?
Did you call the State Police?
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What?
I want you to leave with us. Right now.
You still believe in him.
Not really...
The television said they've started with the looting already. Vultures.
Yes. I can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the White House.
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
I'm making a mess.
What'd I say?
I'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
Grey, you read me?
Well, er... it's slowing down.
He's trying to impress you.
Look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab Dylan and come stay with me on base.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
I shouldn't have left her.
He's got that SEGA Saturn CD, 64 bit, right?
I'm bringing home the bacon. Earning my keep. And doing a fine job if I do say so myself.
Why did you people come here?
Can we negotiate a truce? Is there room for co-existance?  Can there be peace between us?
What do you want us to do?
Marcus Brody, sir. And where is Indy?
Oh, what?... your servant, sir.
Your treat.
Venice, Italy!
How's the head?
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Don't worry. Doctor Schneider will be there to meet you.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
Tapestries?
Where did this come from?
The Ark of the Covenant.
Are you sure?
Don't wander off.
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!
Dad!
You did!!
I came here to save you.
She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
My lucky charm.
I ought to tell you something.
Stop!
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
Well... I can't think of anything.
It's a new experience for me.
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Ready?
Uh-huh.
I'm not exactly... a knight. What do you mean?
My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
Well, Mr. Prime Minister, my report will duly note that we found nothing unusual here in Pankot.
Who?
Miss Scott, you're not making any sense.
There, you see, Captain. A rock!
You have insulted my son.
Indy?
That little Maharajah think he big stuff.
No.
He was afraid of you. He knows a tough guy when he sees one.
What does it mean, Indy?
The village knew their rock was magic -- but they didn't know it was one of the lost Sankara Stones...
Slow on the curves or we'll fly off the tracks!
That's what you've got these children -- these slaves digging for?
Took what?
Me seduce you? Honey, you're the one who took your clothes off.  I just came over to remind you that you never know what else might be in the water.
Thanks for nothing! I hate snakes!
Legend says he told Sankara to go forth and combat evil. To do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.
You're nice. Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
Oh my God! He ripped out his -- he killed him!
I'm not leaving without those stones.
What?
...reporting....him... ventriloquism...On a bus
Me.
What street?
Go home. Good idea. Get some rest.
Somebody's been here.
Kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
Yeah...Who?
Quit screwing around, this is important.
The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
Loading a gun.
You're not crazy.
I'll tell you what to say.
Now what?
Too late...They want you.
I don't know anything. I just want to go home.
It can't take that long.
They could put you back in the tube..
We have to get out of here.
What does it say.
Take a left and your next right.
That's it. They know I'm in here. We've got to find them.
What do we do?
I don't have any.
Use my credit cards.
Why not?
I'll get in trouble.
Because you got my ID. Now brace yourself. I'm gonna try something with your glands.
What is it?
Do you notice anything.
You eat it.
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
The sand.
I don't want to eat it.
Which language?
I'm not some hot shot test pilot. I'm not some playboy. I don't usually pick up girls.
Who are they? Stay on them, will you. How can we find out...Wait. The glasses.
I feel like an idiot.
They're all in it.
What if she says something important?
Oh come on.
Joe! It's 56 hours!
You found her.
Just stay here and rest.
Where are you going?
`Joe. I'm here. You're Okay.
What do I do?
I told you, I have a feeling...
I can't...
What are you doing?
What?
What was it? What'd I say?
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
And Dieter?
Do it.
She works for them.
I know it's no good.  I've no right to be jealous.
You just got a Mickey.
Oh, I can't.
I knew you were trouble.
They have stolen state property.
Impossible.
What Job?
Who is your friend?
And...you know Jan Gruner?
You may not remember things.
Oh...that's okay.
We're here.
Take the card.
I'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
Ahhh...nothing.
I noticed you staring.
You may you find all the solitude you want.
Nothing.
Oh...and who is it!?
...Blake
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Do what?
Let you leave without it.
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
You mean from it.
Can I help?
That you're not crazy.
You did.
Who do you work for?
No. Ryuji just hires us.
I don't know, Ryuji said there was a change of plans.
You work for Ryuji?
I'm leaving too.
I don't know. He mentioned a city.
You don't believe me.
Now what?
How?
That I really don't know.
What? Oh, about Dieter, Yes. It was him. Gruner works for him.
What a mess.
How?
Why not, what are you going to do?
Kiss her you fool.
I knew it. I told him.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
Water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
Why not?
Just one. The back up.
What's new?
She was playing with the Pooh doll.
What's that outside, Daddy?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
Just ran into two of your "geologists." Geologists whose hands aren't all chewed up...?
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Push it.
I want you to get legal onto CORPORATE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENTS. Boundaries of their constraint. Kentucky state law about. I want you to drop everything.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I heard Wigand's deposition got sealed.
Yeah, I heard rumors.
No, I'm questioning your hearing! You hear "reasonable" and "tortious interference." I hear... "Potential Brown & Williamson lawsuit jeopardizing the sale of CBS to Westinghouse." I hear... "Shut the segment down. Cut Wigand loose. Obey orders. And fuck off...!" That's what I hear.
You're taking "no" for an answer?
What does it look like I'm doing? I'm editing.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
So, what happened to Ms. Caperelli's checking with outside counsel first, all that crap?
What caliber is my gun?
You can't take that... It's personal property...!
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
Shall I send for coffee? Sorry I'm late.
No, only that we would hold the story until it was safe for him...
Hi, baby.
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
You ready...?
Lowell?
Don't you have to be at the office?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
I don't understand.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
What's the difference...
Thank you, Bob.
Yeah.
Will independent sources corroborate that?
Get some perspective, Lowell.
Oh, my God.
Well, we'd certainly be interested in making his acquaintance, but without knowing what he's going to do...
Yeah, I'm here.
Hardly new news.
No shit.
We got a guy... who wants to talk but he's constrained.  What if he were "compelled"?
Oh, man.
Oh, please, Mike...
Coffee?
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
To straighten something out with you. Right here. Right now.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
My father was a mechanical engineer... most ingenious man I ever knew.
No.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
I don't know how to say this, Jeff, except to just say it right out, so I'll say it. They do not want to air it.
ABC...?
I'm on a leave of absence. Forced vacation.
Did he hear you?
What?
Well, no, look... I mean, there was a footprint. Forget it. It's probably not important at all.  You know, I got a job now. I'm teaching high school. Japanese and Chemistry.  So, what were you calling about?
I heard you. But I got to arrange a legal defense first. I got to get you to testify in court, get it on public record.
Good to meet you, Dr. Wigand.
In other words, you were charging Sandefur and Brown & Williamson with ignoring health considerations consciously...
Most certainly.
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Jeff's a premiere golfer... What are you, a two handicap?
Now, don't be paranoid, Jeff.  About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences of opinion...
Okay.  I don't believe you can maintain corporate integrity without confidentiality agreements. I was paid well for my work. The health and welfare benefits are good. The severance package is fair. I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.
Well, I wouldn't say --
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
What a touching story.
That's his lawyer.
Who's next, Mrs. Rabinow.
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
You want Botox?
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
Who was that?
It sounded like a bell.
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
No.
He's passionate.
Marylin! Listen to me.
No. Don't stop.
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
Me. Yes.
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
You do?
Good.  Are those foods?
I love you. I want to have your baby.
May I come in?
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
Hello?
Murder!
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Who's that?
You used his credit card.
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
Of Massey Myerson?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
That's delusional.
My client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
And it's good!
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
I am very sorry.
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
What...?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Yeah.
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
Stunt?
Oh, yes. I heard.
Why? Do you know him? 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
If you really mean it, I will.
It's not quite that simple.  I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one—
Why; naturally, I—
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that—
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
Oh, yeah?
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
I beg your pardon!
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you?  Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
I didn't ask for your advice. 
That's none of your business.
Are you talking to me!
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you?  All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Who, me?  Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
I can't go out like this.
Nope. No complaints.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Thanks, professor.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man!  Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
Next week "East Lynne."
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Well, take them off.
What's the matter?
What?
Really?
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
Amazing.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What for?
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
That's swell!
Nope.
Me?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Congratulations.
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
You bet we did.
Whatever you say, darling.
Why, he'll be back.
What time is it?
Yeah!
Here's another wire from Peter Warne.
Collect?
Never mind . . . Listen—suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
You're drunk.
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
When you sober up—come in and see me.
Funny couple, ain't they?
Yeah?
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone!
That's right.
What?
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
Orange, New Jersey.
You love them, don't you?
Sure—sure—I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Well, what do you expect from a pig but a grunt.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
Oh, I first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when I lived down in the Quarter.
Hell, no!  I told this Bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. I deal with muni court, I'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.
There were no phone records.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Maybe there's more to this, Susie. The CIA's keeping something from our enemies.
We're saying that when Oswald went to Russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.
I'll go you one better!  Maybe Oswald didn't even pull the trigger, Bill. The nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on November 22nd. And on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.
Where you going, boss?
Shaw's our toehold, Bill.  I don't know exactly what he is, where he fits, and I don't care.  I do know he's lying through his teeth and I'm not gonna let go of him!
If I'm so far from the truth, why is the FBI bugging our offices?  Why are our witnesses being bought off and murdered?  Why are Federal agencies blocking our extraditions and subpoenas when we were never blocked before?
No, I did not.
...did you ever use the alias Clay Bertrand?
You think your investigation's been all that secret?  You know, when you talk to people, they talk to other people.
Listen, Dave, why don't we order some room service, have a bite, relax. I'll stay as long as you want.
That's not true.  I never met anybody named Oswald.  Anybody who told you that has to be crazy.
I see.  And where did you drive?
Did you bag any geese on this trip?
Oh yes, well, come to think of it, they're right.  We got to where the geese were and there were thousands of them.  But you couldn't approach them.  They were a wise bunch of birds.
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Who was paying you, Dave?
Colonel Finck, are you saying someone told you not to dissect the neck?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
I don't remember his name.  You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
Jesus, Ed, from time immemorial it's been standard booking procedure to ask an alias.  You know that.  There's no constitutional requirement that says a lawyer has to be present for routine questions.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
Four to six.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
None either.  It's bizarre.  It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out.  Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63.  A man who has defected once already.  It's crazy.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams.  It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
Honey, you all right? 
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake!  You going to stay up all night every night?  For what?  So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too.  It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
What?
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
I promise I'll make more time for Jasper.
Well so do I, goddammit!  So do I! I had a life too, y'know - I had a life, too.  But you just can't bury your head in the sand like some ostrich, goddammit, Elizabeth!  It's not just about you - and your well- being and your two cars and your kitchen and your TV and "I'm jes fine honey."  While our kids grow up into a shithole of lies!  Well, I'm not "fine" about that, I'm angry. My life is fucked, Liz!  And yours is, too!  And if you don't want to support me I can understand that but don't you go start making threats of taking the children away.
What's wrong, Lou?
Graveyard dead.  August this year.  A single car accident on an empty road in Midlothian, Texas.  The doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died. 
Can we find her?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
Didn't Hoover say something about that?  The leaves had fallen off in November?
General Charles Cabell.  Deputy Director of the CIA.  Fired by Kennedy in '61 because of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, he moved back to the Pentagon, called Kennedy a "traitor".  When he came to New Orleans to address the Foreign Policy Association, you know who introduced him?  Our friend Clay Shaw.
The Warren Commission call him?
Are you giving me an ultimatum, Lou?
You know, something always bothered me about that from day one, and I can't put my finger on it.
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
...and your General?
I knew the man 20 years.  That's him.  The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring.  What was he doing there?  If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered.  And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
And he never hit you before?
Why did Guy beat you, Jack?
Where is Banister in all this?
Like I said, a fuckin' nuthouse.
Never.  Not with me sir, never... Listen, I think I'd better go.  I said enough.  I said all I'm going to say. 
Then what are we going through all this trouble for?
Where were you?  Europe, Pacific?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
Virginia.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
Yes.
No, that could not be done, Mr. Ruby. There are a good many things involved in that.
What are they?
Tomorrow I'll talk to your probation officer. Karen's a good kid, but she's mad at you, because you lied to her. This business about your grandmother's funeral
I don't know. Maybe it's a language problem.  Anita, you ever cause this much heartache over something that could easily be avoided, I'll never write you again. You understand?
I'm still scared as a motherfucker, Ordell. They talkin' like they serious 'bout me doin' that machine gun time.
How old is that machine gun shit?
Three years. That crime's old, man. They ain't got room in prison for all the motherfuckers out there killin' people. How they gonna find room for you?
Aaaaawww man, I wasn't plannin' on goin' no place. It's twelve o'clock, man. I'm home, I'm high --
Uh-huh.
I wanna help you, but I don't wanna be locked in the trunk of no car.
Course you didn't.
We are. Don't worry about it.
Hi, I'm Detective Mark Dargus. L.A.P.D. can I ask what you have in that bag?
Take your time.
You're not tired of it?
But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation.  How 'bout another?
What did they want to know?
It was the other guy who busted me.
With ten thousand? Nine.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
What'dya think?
If you're having some.
Want to hear some music?
Uh-huh.
'76?
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
He told me last night.
He came by.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
Make the delivery somewhere in the mall.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
And went to this guy's house in El Monte, and I waited for him.
You do that?
That's my job.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
Do you think they bought it?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
He's liable to shoot you.
He's already there.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Madrid or Barcelona?
Well, that's the State's offer. If you plead to possession and tell L.A.P.D. what they want to know, your bond will be set at one-thousand dollars. If you don't, L.A.P.D. will request one at twenty-five thousand based on your prior record and risk of flight. If you don't post it or don't know anyone who can, you'll spend six to eight weeks in County before your arraignment comes up.
He say we like the same thing as married.
Look, that shit ain't mine.
No.
This is A.T.F. agent Ray Nicolet, Jackie Brown, Ordell Robbie money exchange trial run. It's three p.m., July 4th 1997. The location is the parking structure at LAX.
I'm recording this.
You two meet?
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Not really.
That would be one point of view.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
There was a guy with Melanie?
We pick up Ordell. We've got three murders we can link him to. We have the storage unit where he keeps his guns, by tomorrow we'll have a search warrant to go in and get him. And we have you.
You think I'm kidding?
Jackie?
Yeah, do you like it?
Thanks.
You told em? You told em it's me?
Well, shit. That don't mean you gotta confirm it!
Who?
Yeah, but it's my money, and I don't need me a partner.
What'd you care?
I was there, I saw her do it.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
Want a hit?
Two months shy of four years.
No.
Did you ever go I one?
That's a picture of me in Japan.
You been to Japan?
Must of made quite an impression.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
Uh-huh?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Louis, this is it, man. I'm gonna make me a million dollars out of this. I already got me a half-a- million sittin' in Mexico. When I do this last delivery, I'm gonna make me another half-million.
Nothin' really. Just kinda goin' back and forth. They had some black girl from some black show on Jay Leno. I watched that for a bit, but I kept flippin channels cause I didn't know who she was.
C'mon in.
That was Beaumont.
An employee I had to let go.
Yeah.
What's your relationship?
It's Louis.
You shot Melanie?
Where's the rest of it?
Then what?
That's right.
You gonna tell me who it was?
You see Max Cherry in the dress department. We're about to be handed half-a-million dollars -- Man, look at me when I'm talking to you! And you don't think nothing of him being there!
Hold on a minute.  Where you going?
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
So, you want a ten-thousand dollar bond. What've you got for collateral?
Cost you a thousand for the bond.
Haven't a clue.
They do consider this a violation of his probation. Your boy's looking at ten years, plus the concealed weapon.
Across the street a Great Western. It goes in a trust account. You'll need to fill out an Application for Appearance Bond, an Indemnity Agreement, a Contingent Promissory Note. That's the one, if Beaumont skips and I go after him, you pay the expenses.
Yes.
Comfortable?
I can see that. Why?
It still sounds high.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Somebody already did.
The stewardess. Do you know her last name?
Was she?
Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand?
She got off, huh?
I thought you might be asleep.
Jackie didn't trust Melanie. She'd already tried to get Jackie to go in with her, split the half million amongst themselves. What she did was take quite a risk to see you get your money.
All I did was walk out with it.
You get used to it after a while. Now tell me where my money's at.
She wanted to see me, why wasn't she home?
Call her, tell her the combination.
That's why she's givin' up my money huh? Not that bullshit about Melanie. I didn't trust her ass neither, but I knew how to handle her. She was my blonde-headed little surfer gal. I fuckin' told Louis he could've just given her a punch in the mouth, he didn't need to shoot her. She's at your office.
She's all alone.
Turn left.
You sure?
Yes.
Get that for me, will ya baby?
Who is it?
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
Go on Jake. She reads 'em like a book.
I see.
By who? Why? Paul didn't have an enemy in the world.
Stop!!!!
It's not funny. According to this ... you're already dead.
Listen, Jake. I gotta go.
I'll tell you what's gotten into me. I don't know you from Adam, right? You come to my office with this bizarro story and demand I look into it. Okay. I said I'd check it out and I did. Now I don't know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and I don't like it.
She told you that?  Did she tell you about the $2,000 I'm still paying for the orthodontist? I'll bet she didn't mention that.
Loves me!? She hasn't said a kind word about me in years!
Are you in the service?
Hmm. I don't suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
Demons, Jacob? Why demons? Are you writing ... ?
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Jacob, I don't believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. I don't be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. I don't believe in enternal damnation. I don't believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. We don't need them. We do a good enough job on ourselves.
What was that?
It's freezing.
I'm not dead. I am not dead.
Jacob, what can I do?
I'm going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. This may hurt a little.
What the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
Why didn't you turn on the light?
That help?
The room!
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
Lemme see.
What do you mean you can see?
Why do you bring her up?
What does that have to do with anything? Does it explain the barricaded subway stations? Does it explain those Godforsaken creatures?
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Show me Della!
What does it say?
Get your clothes off.
Remember that.
I don't believe this.
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
Who was that?
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
No. I'm a marked man, Jez. I'm the only one left. I don't want to expose you to that. It's not right for you or me. Be reasonable.
I love you when you're angry.
No! What's going on? Where's my family?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
You've lived with me for two years.
Well leave then. Go to Hell.
You look upset.
Where's West? New Jersey?
Where's Sarah? Where are the boys?
Where have they gone?
Surprised, huh? I told you you'd know me. I've been tracking you for a long time. I just wish I'd spoken to you before tonight.
Right. They were worried. They figured you guys were too soft. They wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? And we did it. The most powerful thing I ever saw. Even a bad trip, and I had my share, never compared to the fury of the Ladder.
So why tell me now?
Never?
Throw that torch away, young man. Give yourself up. You're under arrest.
Total delirium.
I'll page him.
Paul Gruneger!
Why the hell we drivin' here?
I just need to talk.
Let's get a couple drinks, okay?  Hey, take a look behind us. Do you think that car is followin' us?
Who is?
Bring it in.
Pour it in.
On top of him?
Yes it does.
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
His mother?
Bomb?
Sergeant!
Okay that hurt.
Where have you been?!!
Better let me.
Everyone okay?
Thorgan, suit up.
Then what do we do?!
Earth II.
Jesus what the hell is that?
JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt.
You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!!
Outta here?
See? We're not so bad.
You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it.
It's time.
I'm thinking Rizzo was right.
Kaboom.
I'll help you in.
Close the fucking door!
I'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
Hurry! She's lost it!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
I'm just saying.
Kay-em 14.
Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
Who are you apologizing to?
Do I have to?
You did good, Kay-Em. I'm proud of you.
Kay-em you okay?
Something's wrong.
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking.  He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
More soldiers?
How do you open the damn door?
Son! -- Out of the water now!
I'm all checked out for light surf and look at it.
This is Matt Hooper...
The wire's showing!
Let's call in -- we can radio and have a big boat here in an hour...
Did you get him in the head?
Right.
Older, sillier.
How come you have to tell them that?
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
There's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...
It's called Territoriality. It's a theory.
...And it was Dartmouth Winter weekend, and she was Homecoming Queen, and I was her date; then she got into the fact that her family had more money than my family, and she was right -- her great-grandfather was in mining, and my ancestors were Yankee shipbuilders. So we broke up and I went home with some beatnik from Sarah Lawrence.
What's that?
A shark's attack is stimulated by the kind of splashing and activity that occurs whenever humans go swimming -- you can't avoid it!
I hope we get some more help.
What's that, a ship?
What day is this?
What d'you pay for a place just for the summer?
We're not even sure what it was.
You do this all the time, right, Charlie?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
You love sharks?
Going out on the 'Aurora.'
Take my car, okay?  You come with us, Lenny.
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
What's that supposed to prove?
Nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
What can that gun of yours do?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running. She wants to know if you're coming to her little coffeehouse performance on Saturday.
Hey Bleek.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Go Carole.  So, guess what?
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Whose idea was it?
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Hey Juno... A couple of us are going to the cineplex after school to donut that movie with the guy with eighteen kids.
We could get back together too.
Leah just told me you were going with her.
You're mad. Why are you mad?
Oh my God, SHUT UP!
You shouldn't be carrying that heavy bag. I'll take it.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
No... I guess not.
Excuse me?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
Shit.  Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
Tell me about it. I used to play in a really tight band back when I lived in Chicago, and one night we opened for the Melvins... do you know who the Melvins are?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave.
God, pretentious much? I guess everyone should have a mysterious name like Juno, huh?
I doubt anyone's throwing us a shower.
Oh really? What's the verdict?
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
You've never been to a dance, have you?
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
No, not yet. I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
No...
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Hi Dad.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
You don't say.
What do you make with that?
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Juno, what's the matter?
I didn't do anything... I just... I've just been thinking.
Yeah, downtown.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
Adele for god sake please lis...
What?
...Yeah.
Adele... are you serious?
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
What?
...thank you.
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Vernon, Florida.
Can't hurt.
Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri?
Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together.
Bitch, bitch, bitch!
Who said he's my good buddy?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Brian I want him out of our car!
Carrie, watch for Early.
Where would we find him?
What about the owner of the house...  ...this John Diebold, any idea where he might be?
...Diebold?
How old you?
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
With how many people?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
How?
To what? Virgins?
I don't know. That's too easy. I mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. That's so easy.
You got any money?
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
And it got me thinkin'. How fun it would be to share each other's girl.
Darcy. Benny's little sister.
Darcy?
I don't understand why you do that.
So really, it's good luck.
Holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Man we fucked him up.
Come on nigga. Sup, sup then? Stop faking moves.
Come on. Come swimmin' with us.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
She won't? Why not?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
I'm nervous.
I like you so much. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't believe it.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
Because I'm a virgin and I don't want no baby.
Because I like you. I think you're beautiful. I think if we fucked you would love it. You wouldn't even believe it.
What?
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Miss, would I be prying?
No.
You didn't?
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
What happened?
You know... You know a lot of times sex gets in the way. Has that ever happened to you?
I was like yes! I'm going out with him!
Yeah. The shit gets wacked. Fifteen minutes.
Yep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
What are you guys doing?
I don't know, eight or nine.
That's the whole thing. You know if you look at it. I mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. And everyone's dying. And you better wear a condom or else. But the truth is. I don't know any kids with AIDS. No one I know has ever died from that shit. It's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
What man? What is it?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
What?
You know, I figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  You think I'm right?
No it wasn't.
No.
Fuck you!  I'm tired of your goddam accusations!  If you want to arrest me go ahead!  Otherwise back off.
I gotta friend over there.  He was telling me things are kind of slow. So, I figured I'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  You know, give him something to do.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
Sorry.
We'll find the evidence.
Very amateurish, Peter.  I'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  I'm not an idiot!  Don't treat me as one!  I'll call you everyday... You get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  Are you ready to play?
You don't want to think and that's why I'll win!  I'm already two points ahead.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
I'm just trying to play the game.
I'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what I have to say.
What?
Emotional?  I expected more from you.
They took away the game because of him. My father left and my mother...  There was so much blood... It covered everything.
D2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  It's the number two variation of the Tarakoss opening.  David, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
Never mind.  He died two years ago.
Computers.  That's how you got into Homesearchers records.  You can get into anything.  But why?  Why?
What scars?
I just can't believe it.
I'm just nervous.  Sorry.
I can't sleep.  My beds lumpy.
I'm sorry, honey, I can't.  Not today.
Whaddaya got, Nolan?
Six, eight hours tops.
There's only two hardware stores on the whole Island.  We'll check that out. What about the blood?
That's great.
I see you're still having problems with your openings.
I know that.  I've seen the photo's.
I thought that Homesearchers was a dead end?
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
She called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
Why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
I understand that this is just another one of your games.
Then I'll transpose.
We got a problem?
Because I love them, but they drive me crazy.  You know how parents are?
Are you with the tournament?
What are you looking for?
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
Take your average cop.  They deal with death everyday.  If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
What about you?  Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
You know, Andy thinks you're doing this.
No.  But I'm open to distractions.
You always want to talk about me.  What about you?
I tried again and got through.
In a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... Why does he set this line apart?
Exactly.  It's the key.
A fierce magazine... brutal...  An angry magazine... A war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  Mad.
I want someone I can get close to. I don't know if that's possible with you.
No, listen.  You have no idea of the kind of pressure I'm under right now.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
Why not?
You're right.  The killer told me.
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
That's worse.
Well, you're beautiful.
We're almost married.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
I love you, Lyssa, I love you ...
In the Arctic ice.
But it opens onto the sheer wall of the Needle. There's no way down.
You choose these?
I can't reach her.
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
The first time, when they attacked long ago, was The Beast here?
Then we must reach her before she feels that pain.
She can see the Beast!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
You're coming with us.
Even by you?
I ache with it.
I don't think you'll grow careless.
They stand at the edge of the grave and make jokes.  Do you know who I am, sprout? I am Torquil, Lord of the forest. My men follow no man but me, and I follow no man at all.
It should be an interesting journey, then.
Lad, you have an unnatural desire to pay for things. It stunts the mind and shrivels the imagination.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
A venison pie as big as a house.
What kind of a boy are you? Boys always have candy.
If I could wish ...  ... for anything, I'd wish for a venison pie the size of a ...  ... mountain. No, that's too greedy. I'd settle for one the size of a house.
I only want one.
What are you doing with my dear? Stop! Thieves!
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
We have plenty of hares.
Passable, pimple, very passable.
Look at its insides.
It's a lie!
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
You were attacked in the forest?
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
Yes. You have left your place in the Needle. It is the time, then.
It is the time.
The Dark Ones will appose you with all their power.
Many have perished in that maze.
The leader of the Dark Ones?
I'll stay behind and keep them busy.
It is fifty years since I heard that name.
He forgot his money...  My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
...Office 2702.
No?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
YEAH! I was sure! Come on, tell me! I know him?
No.
...You moved too, didn't you?
At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
Pay attention to women, Leon.  They are dangerous, you know?
How can you say it?
Well, if the guy is far, in a car, and I know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, I think I would plastic the car, with a remote here. I shoot from the distance and if I miss I plastic.
Rocket launcher.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
What?
...You can leave whenever you want. I don't refrain you.
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
A little...
It's too big.
No! I don't want to leave you!!
...Yes?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
Here comes the resume.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
Sergeant, I'm a psychologist and I know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... My uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
Look, I'll see if anyone has spotted him recently.  If I get any information, I'll call you.
I know what you're getting at.
... Love is shown through actions not just words.
... People that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... My parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  I don't want us to be that way Ellen.
Your father?
Go to sleep Ellen.
The beach of Pacifica, California.
Pacifica, California.
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
Shit!  He jumped!
Anyway, Big Billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'Who can play baseball?' And there was a little voice that yelled out, 'Me, I can play.' Everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
You're amazing.
They printed your article on, 'Dry Verses Can Dog Food'... Very enlightening.
To reach people, you have to feel something first... You write about the wrong things.  How can you feel for dog food?  The people at the Gazette don't respect it, and neither do you.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
I need to show her how much I love her Kris.
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
I missed you Kris.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
What do your friends call you?
Hello.
Are you working?
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
Do you want to fuck now?
Don't run away.
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
Sera...
Me neither.
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
Can we just forget it?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
How much, do you think?
I want this, Sera. I need this!
Yes? What?
What alibi?
What're you so happy about? You're on trial for murder.
He's an ass that's gonna try.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
Enrique's gay. I'm sure of it.
Did she have a weapon in her hand?
Yes, Your Honor. Had you ever gotten a perm before, Miss Windham?
Because they got wet.
You followed your intuition today and you were right on target. I should've listened.
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
For what? Breaking my heart or ruining sex for me with any other man?
Yes?
You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's "I met someone else. Move out."
You showed up Warner in class? You're supposed to be showing up Sarah.
God, that felt great!
The idiot speaks.
I'm a bitch.
Yes, you are.
You're pawning The Rock?!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Elle, do you know what happened on "Days of Our Lives" yesterday?
Don't ask.
Blondes are discriminated against worldwide! Brooke's a blonde, and people are saying she's sleeping with the cheesy pool boy and shooting her husband. If she was a mousy brunette, it would be, "Oh, the poor widow."
That is a direct result of anti- blonde discrimination!
Hey --
Oh, my God!
How could this happen?
I don't know --
It's pink.
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
Of course.
Then what? My boobs are too big?
How can it be the right thing if we're not together?
You go where?
That's because I spend all my time with case studies and hypos.
If you tell him, you'll probably make summer associate. Who cares about Brooke? Think about yourself.
Yes.
And what is your boyfriend's name?
We come watch... we come watch...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
You're magnificent.
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
Precisely, my darling.  Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
Course not.  I no flum here.  I come flum Cathay.
Cathay?
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
Damnation!  Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters!  You've bested me, Jack.
You have me word, lad.  To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
Are ye afraid of me wine?  Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk?  Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Then, what's gone wrong?  Why did it happen?
True... But it won't come easy or free.  If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
I'm sure.  It spoke to me.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
Good.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Why not mine the damned walls?
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
There isn't much time!
What magic have we on our side?
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
It doesn't matter.
The wound is mortal.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
Listen to him.  Not in the mood...
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Someone like Floki... or Squarefoot... or --
You promised!
Liar!
Sport, indeed.
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
What shall we do?
I'm not its master.
Where are you going?
My father and the Baron.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
That's why he goes masked during the day...
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
Sigurd's sword...
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death?  It is a time of mourning.  This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Ask away, sweet man.
You'll visit again?
And charmed, of course.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
Please...
Heading north still?
Praise be to God.
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Uhm... fine work.
Are you going to see Sam again?
Alyssa.
I mean drugs.  I thought you said he was?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
Really?
You're off, you know?  You're way, way off.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
You hate your father.
He's at work while I'm here.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
That would take weeks.
Peter Webber!  Right.  Quite the spotlight on that guy.
This isn't me.  We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  But you won't change.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I've got one favor to ask.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work.  I could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  They're a part of this firm.  They inspire me.  I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed.  It amazes me. I would miss that too much.  Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Thank you.
She didn't really say.
Uh huh.
I'll be around to check up on you.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam.  I won't ever hit you.  This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it.  So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  Now.
Probably in the bible.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
What I'm not.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I gave up on you.
Are you talking?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
You look better than ever.
Are you taking them still?
I never tried to get you to like me.  I tried to get you to love me.
Your kid was down around Diver's Cover again, smoking pot.  I didn't write him up...told him I wouldn't tell you...
Thanks for telling me.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
I just wanted to know where Mom was?
She needs to be alone, I think.
I was parked in day parking.
I don't have a phone.
I can't leave the house?
No.  I was going to let you do that.
What have you been before today?
I dreamed about your house last night.
It's been a while.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
Back.  Neck.  Back.
Then you tell me, what just happened?
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
That's the problem.
Do you know anything about building a house?
Can you stay for dinner?
Why?
Nothing R, okay?
They ain't men, Mae Rose. They're convicts. And nigger convicts to boot. Can you say nigger?
Is Mae Rose okay?
I'm talking about a haircut.
What am I gonna do out there, Ray? I can't go home to my mama like this. I'll get the strap for sure.
You probably mean Can't Get Right. That's him over there.
Yeah.
Take care of me?
Damn dentures slipping again. Everything falls apart when you grow old, eh, Claude? Time sure marches on.
That's alright, boss. Takes a lot more than a colorful brochure to hurt my feelings.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Forty years. That's a long time for any crime, even murder.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
What are they gonna do to us?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
You mean this sign? The one that says "No Coloreds Allowed." That's a good question. Ray, how come we missed the sign?
Don't Uncle Claude me. You get a load of those crackers? Couldn't be a mouthful of teeth among the bunch of 'em. Why you want to pick a fight with people like that for?
Oh, I don't know, maybe because our lives depend on it, I just sort of thought you knew what you were doing!
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
Reward?
He even got my daddy's watch.
Yeah, nobody puts 'em away like old what's-his-name.
Would you look at that, Ray. Winston up and died on us.
Spanky's gonna be pissed? Poor Spanky. Fuck Spanky! What the hell kind of a name is Spanky, anyway? You're responsible for this situation. I blame you for everything. If it wasn't for you, I'd be home having a hot meal right now.
The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that?
You call this a map? What was Cookie smoking when he drew this?
Give me back that hot dog. I'll eat it myself.
You can starve to death for all I care. Now shut up, the game's about to start.
It's amazing what Ray here can do with a couple of pounds of potato skins and some molasses.
Crawfords.
Let it go, Claude.
The only thing I regret is the day I met you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Go where, Ray?
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
We lost yesterday on accounta the rain. That means we gotta make up for it today, so put your backs to it.
Move it out.
What do you think about that?
It's alright for a man to cry once in awhile. Just don't make a habit of it.
What's going on here?
That watch was the only thing my daddy ever gave me. It meant the world to me.
Hey, Ray, what's the name of that nightclub of yours?
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
Let her go.
And he's dead serious.
"Let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
All right. Let me out.
No!
All these good people have totally been led astray.
She goes to Parson's, right?
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Release the evil?
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
What's with all the whoo-whoo noises?
You did it for Namath.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
How bad?
Bus?
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
Should we wake him up?
Looking for the chief.
Which way did he go?
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Sometimes, sure.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
What were you thinking coming here?
Yes...
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
Don't do it.
Nicky!
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
It looks like the work of a brother...
See something you like, my man?
I'm a Sandman!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... The other food stopped coming and they started.
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
I didn't do anything, Francis! They've made us believe that...
I'm Mary 2.
Please... no?  You mean "not here" -- that's it? You're a private Available but particular.  Don't worry. There's no one here but me. And you.
You shouldn't even think such things...  And you picked a strange person to say them to --
Of course.
I'm going to run.
It's different now. Help me.
Where did you get that?
I don't..
If you did know, you'd tell me.
If you trusted me, you'd know.
Some people say children need human mothering.
But what is this -- why?
How will they know we're coming?
Will you take me with you?
Some kind of breeding pens... I suppose... They say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
Of course.
Beloved husband...
Hello.
How long have you been living here?
What kind of place is this?
My parents thought so. Mother and Father. You know?
Yes...
Sure, what's wrong with that?
What's that, Ed?
I don't know.
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
Pete?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
You like it?
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
Pete... Don't...
How'd it happen, Alice?
In pornos?
Andy?
Set.
You got him.
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Yes, there was a man with you... She brought you here... She didn't know what else to do.
Never saw him before in my life.
The wife killer?
If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
Now, Mack, what's the situation?
Do you remember?
He's not Madison?
DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS IT TAKES TO STOP A CAR AT 35 M.P.H.?
There's no other bedroom?
My... My head.
Don't you want to watch it?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
Sorry about that, Pete, but tailgating is one thing I can't tolerate.
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
Suit yourself, champ.
Hello.
Okay.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
Whatiya mean, Sheila?
Cable from Gainsford.
Not even a radio?
Found in Asia!
Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Uh-huh.
Yes, it just shows—  I don't know why I'm talking to you. I don't know you. Who are you?
Don't call me brother.
I beg your pardon.
That's ridiculous.
Where are they? Do you see them?
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
And be poisoned out here in the open?
No.
Hey - look!
I think I'll stick around. I'll leave with the porters on their next trip.
There are some things, my dear Conway, I deeply regret I may not discuss.
By the way, what religion do you follow here?
Who?
He amputated his own leg?
Very often.
The only one.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Young? She arrived here in 1888. She was 20 at the time. She was on her way to join her betrothed - when her carriers lost their way in the mountains. The whole party would have perished but for meeting some of our people.
Leave Shangri-La! That's not likely. You couldn't drive her out.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Oh, I'm so glad.
Now, what would you like to do?
Yes.
Just what I needed too.
Hello, Freshie. Did you make that report out yet?
Hurray for us. Did you say that we left ten thousand natives down there to be annihilated? No, you wouldn't say that. They don't count.
What could there be except just another hill? In any event, I'm not curious. At the moment, it seems to me we should be concerned about getting home. I'd give anything to be in London right now.
George, I've been putting things together. Do you notice the resemblance between those natives and the pilot? And why did those clothes materialize so conveniently when they met us at the plane? Chang himself just said that they never venture beyond that point. What brought them there? Unless it was to meet us?
Porters?
Let me up! Let me up!
What about the porters?
Didn't you find out anything about the porters?
I think you've been hypnotized by a lot of loose-brained fanatics. Why, I wouldn't believe it if I heard it in an English monastery. Why should I swallow it here in Tibet?  How do you know the things they told you are true? Did they show you any proof?
Is that all my story meant to you?
Oh yes. It's all set. Maria made the arrangements.
You're wrong, George.
You know, each time I see you, I hear that music. What is it?
You suggested my being brought here, didn't you? What gave you the idea I'd fit in?
Oh, you've read my books. You do more things! What have my books got to do with it?
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Bump?
You see, it's not a dream.
It's not so bad, really. Some phases are a little sordid, of course. That's only to be expected.
It's the most annoying word in the English language. Did you ever hear a child torture his parent with it?  Mother's little darling musn't stick her fingers in the salad bowl. Why? Because it isn't lady- like to do that. Why? Because that's what forks are made for, darling.
I'd love it!
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Well - no - I think I'd better wait. Yes, yes. I will. I'll wait.
I'll make some for you!  You will come today?
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Cowan--
Cowan--
Sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
Sir, you can't just--
This is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. I need you to look at it.  This red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  More specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   I said I need you to look right here.
Underground gas vein.  Next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
What?
We wear black.
So... lemme get this straight.  We got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  We got information no one else in the world is privy to.  And we're in a 1986 Ford LTD about to go look at an insect?
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
Keep her out of here while I check it out.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Ha ha.  No, really.
Kay--
What are you doing?
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Or what's no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid It?
Or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  I really like that.  Let the other girls have the guys like you. Chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  I find you all so boring.
So... how'd you hear about this?
What the hell does that mean?
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
The kid looked desperate.  I figured...
You figured what?
Pardon me.  I hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people aren't ready for what we have.  How is this going to help?
Why don't you ask the Mosebacke?     Brazil. Until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and didn't even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  Today, they don't exist.
Noon exactly.
We're from Scientific American.  We read about your discovery.  We'd like to take a look.
Jesus, everyone's moving.  Could be an assembly.  Does it look aggressive?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
They went right to the President.
Agatha --
I can't.  I have to know.
She died?
-- but he didn't.
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
I can't even stand up --
Kill type?
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Lara --
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
And you say the third prevision was, what, a little fuzzy or something?
Danny Witwer is scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow --
I'm fine.
You understand, John, that the minute Precrime goes national, they're going to take it away from us.
Stop.  Just wait.  Who's the victim?
And who the hell is that?
We're years from that.  John, I'm asking you: please, come in, we'll shut down the system until we get this thing figured out.
You can't run --
Seventeen minutes.
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Got him in the Foxhall.  4421 Gainsborough.
Red Ball?
Confirm with trig and image.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
You ever get any false positives? Someone intends to kill his boss or his wife, but they never go through with it.  How do the precogs tell the difference?
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
There's no question.  You don't have any.
What does he think of your chosen line of work?
So?
Stop --
Come on!
It's a little late for that.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
I forgive you.
Sean, wait...
The precogs were wrong.
I'm asking you again, who made you do this?
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
And how did Lamar become involved?
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
You say some of the children died?
And, yet, a chain of events has started.  A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
Not if I stay away from him.
Why?
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
Nothing.  I didn't kill him.
This is all my fault.
Anne Lively.  John was talking about her right before they took him.
You have an emergency call on your private line.
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
Six years ago.  What did you two talk about yesterday afternoon?
Good God.  What was that?
So there is a way to fool the system?
He's trying to prove his innocence.
There a maid in this hotel?
My name is Danny Witwer.  I'm --
I don't have any sugar either.
I haven't seen him in two years.
Shhh!  They're sleeping.
They've never been separated before.
Maybe if he'd taken one of the males.  But the female, she's the key.  She's the one they listen to, the one with the most talent.  The one who takes care of the other two.
What are you talking about?
When served warm --
Just give me the key. I'm gonna stay here.
I can take you down there.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
I don't know, Forum's pretty hot tonight. It might be hard to get in, though.
So, wait, you're from where?
I don't know about you guys, but I'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
He's okay.
And how could you fucking leave Horrace hanging?
You're not my daddy.
Uncle Bobby?
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
I just wish he never brought it up. Ricky won't shut up about it.
Yeah? You sure?
Shhh. He'll hear you.
Max offered to stake me.
I never promised you anything.
How could you let her see this?
Take her.
Your dance is over.
When's it going down?
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
Brooklyn.
It sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. And since all it is is a drop, the Welshman's got nothing at stake. I say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. It'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
How so?
You bet the ponies?
Smart. Hard as hell to handicap. You know what I like? Hai Alai. Fast game. You know why I like it?
They were out of line --
I'll work it off.
What?
So, that's it. I'm out?
Don't I put food on you're table? I sponsor your training, I take care of your girl and her little baby. I even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
Ruiz knows about this?
You told him you liked him.
You're ready to move up. Christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. May as well get paid instead of punished.
What is it?
I already told you, I parked it for five minutes and I locked it with the club --
We get it. We're sorry.
Hi. I'm Jimmy.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Yeah. I'll find it. It's in Harlem.
I can wait around if you want.
We're with Ruiz.
Any time, bro.
Don't be shitty.
Don't be shitty.
Of course I don't want you to bring it up to him... But if it comes up...
I'll page you.
I will.
I'll page you with the number.
Fuck them.
He didn't say we need guns.
Sorry coach.
Max won't let me drive Jess to dance anymore.
How much was it?
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Oh, give me a break. Don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
I mean, that's what I heard --
I don't know.
Do not put this on Ruiz's tab. Start a new one.
I swear to God, I'll fucking puke.
All the more reason.
Wanna bet?
Float me a hundred bucks.
Why?
Eighty.
Eighty bucks?!?
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
So what do we do?
Scenario B. I think I'm getting under Ruiz's skin. I'm no dummy. He doesn't like how it went down with the Red Drag -- Welshman, whatever. Now I got Fruitpie the Magician telling me I can't call my man Max? And that Welshman's sketchy.  Whatever, I don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, I'm telling you one thing right now, I'm not gonna be late for the dance.
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
You want to come splash around.
Cardiff Giant. Just check.
How much is what?
What the fuck, 'Red Dragon?'
See you later.
No, thanks, man. We got to head out.
I... I just hired these guys to watch my back...
Yeah.
I handle most of Cardiff Giant's stuff.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
You will not carry any other pagers with you. You will not carry anything, for that matter, that I have not just given you.
No...
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
What?
I'm working trains. Selling.
I done told the man what he could do with his train.
When?
I'm working on it.
It's me or you, ain't it, Pops?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
Elijah who?
I'm telling you God's words, not no hustle. I'm talking the words of Elijah, the black man's God. I'm telling you, boy, that God is black.
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I sure met some.
The body is a holy repository.
-- the hardest and the greatest.
I can't.
I want to, Bembry, but I can't.
"I'm telling you God's words, not to hustle."
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Could we sit down someplace?
I can handle it.
Just an idle question.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
It will be rough.
Why are you looking at me like that?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
The Nation will provide for you and the children if anything happens to me.
We need you too!
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Dear heart, I love you.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
I'm gonna try and get some work done tonight.
You put it very well.
Let him finish.
Can I ask you something?
What?
And like a fool I believe it.
The average first offender gets two years for burglary. We were all first offenders. That's what Sophia and Peg drew --
I ain't stupid.
Let's go.
Murder.
Thank you, Brother; Sister, how are you?
What does Sidney say?
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
Jesus, Red, she's just a kid.
Palmed it right in the goddam chamber.
It isn't a hype, Shorty. And I meant what I said: join us.
This is Malcolm, our new guest. We'll treat him like a brother.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
The same thing as you. Except, my reach isn't as long as yours. My father was a policemen, did you know that?
It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
[South America.]
Where do I find you?
[Daniel Rosas Sanchez.]
[Don't lie to me.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[Do you know who I am?]
[I don't know. We were just given instructions to take her.]
[The cops call him 'The Dreamer'.]
[Who's he?]
[You're a liar. Pinta's dead.]
[Yes. Many times.]
My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
So what's wrong?
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
I'll take the .45 and the Webley .32.
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
Where are you from, Creasy?
Why not?
Being unhappy is a state of mind. I never thought about it.
You feel sorry for the husband?
I'm sorry.
Could I ask you a question?
That's not a question.
I'm fine.
We'll be okay once she realizes I'm not a new toy.
They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus.
I want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between Reforma and the freeway junction. In 45 minutes.
[OK, repeat the drop instructions.]
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
You should be sleeping, baby.
He has to go, Samuel.
Creasy.
[When you talked to him, did he look sane?]
That's what friends do.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
Pinta Martin Ramos is just a number to you. Tragic, a public outcry, but a number. One more dead.
I'll call her up.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
Ah?
Marty.
Your son Marty?
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
Benjamin Franklin High School.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
No, Marty, please...
I'll wait for your call.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
So I'll call you tomorrow.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
Hiya, Ralph...
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
Hello, Aunt Theresa.
So what happened, Aunt Theresa, about the milk bottle was my mother-in- law, she comes inna kitchen, Aunt Theresa, and she begins poking her head over my shoulder here and poking her head over my shoulder there, so then she begins telling me how I waste money and how I can't cook, and how I'm raising my baby all wrong, so she got me so nervous, I spilled some milk I was making for the baby...
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
That's right.
Which hospital?
Is there any reason why we shouldn't know the name of it?
Look at that right eye.
She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
I don't think I should have opened my big mouth. Sorry, Ho-Jon.
Thou. For Thou art with me.  Welcome, welcome, welcome!
What?
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Must be the Famous Curb Service Whore –  House. You in the market Duke?
The chest-cutter.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Me, too. Y'all just seen me play my last game.
When?
We got to start rehabilitating, Duke, if we want to be halfway human by the time we get back to our wives.
I think it's a marvelous letter.
Well, sure, if you are, Margaret...
Wait a second...
Is that liquor?
You willing to b-back that up with odds?
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Well, Dad, we haven't found any holes in the large bowel. They've all been in the small bowel, but the smell is different. I caught a whiff of large bowel, but it ain't staring us in the face, right?
Right.
I though you said we didn't have a drop.
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
That's the front up the road a few miles. We have to get by without some of the comforts of home.
Black capsule.
No, no, that one.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Did I ever tell you about Me Lay Marston?
Please!  Face it, Colonel, you don't have us, we have you. Your boys blew this case, we bailed you out. We figure we ought to hang around a day to check the Congressman's kid, and we also figure to play some golf. So if that's okay with you, we got a deal.
You aspirate the blood from the chest cavity. Damn, there's more of it than I thought.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
Captain, I've been observing the nurses on your shift. But naturally your own opinion is more informed than mine.
Very happily married.
It's a matter of definition. Faithful in spirit, yes.
You're leaving tomorrow?
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
Yes, I know. Hi, Ho-Jon. How did it go?
Second pint.
They missed the boat.
Thanks.
If a man isn't a man anymore, what's he got left to live for?
No, never in the slightest.
How much time do I have?
I have not understood what you means.
The blonde dish.
You work those kind of hours, you got to have rest. Which you can't get with somebody jabbering away on a direct line to heaven.
If you say so, Henry. But remember my claustrophobia.
We've got too many wounded for us to handle now! Get on the phone right away and...
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Me?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
Money?  Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it. Do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
The Websters.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Say that again.
You made it up.
In what man!
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
Who, for instance?
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
You shouldn't have gotten out of bed, Miss.
Have you seen him?
Go out and find her!
This is Sourpuss. Er, excuse me. Er, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.
It must be some kind of a gag.
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh?
Join the John Doe Club.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
Yeah. It certainly is.
Sure.
Run a story. Say John Doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
If you ask me, Hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
Show me an American who can keep his mouth shut and—I'll eat him.
What's your name?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
No, she just left. I'm surprised you didn't run into her. She went over to Mr. Norton's house.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what?  I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Racket? What do you mean?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again!
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
Speaking of which. I saw you talking to Ronnie this morning. Why can't you get it back together with her. You've gotta be out of your mind not to get with that one.
Nah, It probably won't turn up anything. I'm just gonna talk to him.
Particles, man. I feel them all the time. I feel them in my arms and legs man, that's how they punish me.
Where's the car?
Really?
Am I gettin' the car?
Hi, Roper.
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
Are you in charge, Roper?
Yep.
What's the point of this?
Explain how that works.
That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.
Around. Barnett's tough competition.
I think I can handle that one.
Nah, I just throw that in because I enjoy it.
You know the ten commandments?
You tell me.
Yes.
You know why I like the track?
The 6 horse is last.
The jockey!
We won.
Is it always like this?
There's your answer. He's smart.
He's gonna kill her no matter what. If I take him these jewels he's gonna kill me and her.
I'm okay. Korda... went down the side of the building...
Roper. Metro Division. Hostage Negotiator. Give me the short version.
I know how you feel, Ray.
Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
Ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
Please. I'm begging you.
I'm not drunk. Yet.
Maybe you should be.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
If you did, you never showed it.
How's Paco doing?
Why don't you come back up with me, Ronnie.
I'm talking about... What are you talking about?
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Like ahh... I don't know...  Five thousand dollars.
There are two million people in there with you.
True.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
How come I can't remember?
It's all here...
The guests are here.
Wake up?!
In a computer program.
Unlimited energy out there.  Enough to run this world for all eternity --
With the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  Redwood forests.  Oceans. Mountains --
We're going to have to reconfigure.
What?
The woman you're stuck on.
Corporate fingerprints all over it.
One condition.
Christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  He insisted it be kept vacant.
That's right.
The truth.
An interface attendant.
What brings you inside?
Someone you have to get back to?
No.
It was a test.
And it meant something.
I wasn't with you.
Transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
Connection approved.  Ready to transmit --
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
-- Standard.
He wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices.
Where did it originate?
... A falcon?
Simon says...
Mordant, go with them and report back to me!
Don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
I hope those Rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
But you know I never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
I'm Bobby Clowes. Kansas City.
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
The commission don't decide how I spend my honeymoon.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Life knocked me back.
When my money moves, I go with it.
Scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
Masseria's confused. He can't figure whether you're workin' for Maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. So he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after Profaci because it happened on his turf. I figure Masseria's gonna try to rub out Profaci, and pin it on us. Then Maranzano will have to kill ya.
You ain't even a man yet.
Come on. It's Christmas. At least stay for breakfast.
I needed to see you again.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
You could have stopped him.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
You fellas got names?
So what is the problem?
Meyer.
No. We ain't even...
Guess I'm not a single type guy.
I'll talk to Nucky. Get you set up like the fuckin' Prince of Wales.
After all this time I'd think you'd know me better, Meyer.
What's your problem?
He's trying to make it.
Boss, I got all the time you need.
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
Tell me, Charlie. Please.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
I've heard so much about this club of yours. I had to come and see.
I must know more of you, my son.
He's an animal!
We must be friends, Charlie.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Sorry, Charlie. I gotta get my Johnson worked tonight.
Jesus.
Aw, buck up. Have another 'tini.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. That is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
Monkeybone...!?
Priceless! Priceless! This stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
What's the "bad" part?
I might wake up.
How was it? I don't recall.
Kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You <u>gotta</u> love me.
Stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. ­- DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- <i></i> Something went very, very wrong here.
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
We like to think so, yeah.
I'm just concerned about my daughter.
I just can't seem to focus on anything these days.
What about the fellow in those pictures?
You know ...  ... whoops!
I was seeing Aaron and there were some ... complications.
Mother, I ...
Mom, I need to talk to you.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
Men ... they're all the same.  Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister.
Oh, it was such a big scandal.
I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ...
Are you sure you got my bag in?
You mean it's dangerous?
Here you are, Senator. Not a bad desk, either. Daniel Webster used to use it.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
That--or he's out blazing trails. He'll show up.
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
You play--left field.
Paine.
Shut up, Diz.
Okay. You don't mind?
Do we *have* to?
Well, let's get going.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Then--in the name of kindness to dumb animals--we can't let him walk into that Senate tomorrow and take a terrible punch in a nose! A couple of us went up there--told him all he could do was beat it--resign--clear out. But--he's in a daze--he's been hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, "I haven't done anything. Why should I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--
Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?
Taylor, my dear.
How do you feel, champ?
Henry Hill.
*You won't?*
What!
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
I *thought* I heard... Yes?
Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
Just a minute, I better make sure.
Will the Senator yield?
Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, too. One look at you and I can see him, back of his old roll top desk, hat and all, getting out his paper. Always kept his hat on his head so as to be ready to do battle. Clayton Smith, editor and publisher, and champion of lost causes.
Ma's told me about it a thousand times.
I will, sir! I will!  I--I don't know how to thank you. I knew, if any man could help me--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Y-yes.
Oh, now--
Certainly would, Joseph.
Just fine.
Yes! I've told Senator Paine for twenty years--
Office of--Senator Smith?
One of those sightseers--you know. You see, I--gosh, I've never been called absent-minded or... but there it was all of a sudden--looking right at me through one of the station doors--
Whose statue is that?
Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time does the Senate--uh--what do they call it?
No. What had you better--?
No, gee--I couldn't stay here--
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
Oh, just a day--
How?
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
We need a lot like him--his kind of character--ideals.
Since sixteen or so.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of--  Could we get on with this, Senator?
Go right ahead.
Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was my trouble all along.  YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--  What's your *first* name?
It *is* not!
Letitia.
Must have been tickled pink.
Already? All these letters?
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she *said* it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Hello.
Well gee--how--how've you been, Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in-- . I suppose--now that you're married--
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
Wait--
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
I'm splendid, too.
I don't understand, sir! I don't know what the gentleman--
Yeah! How about it? You're a nature lover. Do you handle any of that sign language?
What! Who?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
Joe! You *told* him to!
Let's get away from here. 
Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In a month it's worth fifteen bucks!
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No?
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
But--you love him, don't you, Saunders?
That's why I say Miller--Horace Miller. He jumped through hoops for the machine before we moved him up to the bench. He'll take orders.
That's him. Let him in.
Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods don't go in Washington? They've done pretty well by now, haven't they?
Jim!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Mr. President...
Senator Paine.
Deeds?
Who's that?
I haven't.
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
And you saw them happen?
Feel better now?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
What did you mean by that?
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Let's just walk, okay?
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
You're acting like a school girl.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Come on, come on!
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes sir.
I wanna see that guy!
We'll send for the police!
It's a lie!
But your honor—
That's pretty.
Yes.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  Tell him to see me at my office.
No, thanks.
Nah.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
Have a drink?
Uh-huh.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Uh-huh.
Yeah - that's all that's worrying you. What do I want?  A chance to feed a wife and kids! I'm a farmer. A job! That's what I want!
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Look, he's temperamental.
A what?
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
What is your name?
South Dakota north.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
But she's on the telephone—
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Me, sir?
One hundred books?
It's happened before.  I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it.  I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
It's my daughter Sofie... she's gotta problem.
Why's that?
Thank you.
...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
What kind of doubts?
Mr. Follett.
You find it distasteful, don't you?
No?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now.
No... I mean about Althea. About her...  ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up?
I do.
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I'm sorry, your honor.
Yeah.
Does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, Lily?
It was Henry Follett.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
You would have met in some shower eventually...
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
What it might take is... doing time.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
Sure.
Hiya, Doc.
Oh... not a real doctor.
Why don't you tell me?
Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
Feel free to lie down. Most people do.
Hmm.
Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch?  Just kidding.
No.
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
Where?
Did you get headaches before this?  But you get more now? Or more severe?
You're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
Disgusting.
And he's where?
Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Which thing?
Yeah?
Transference!
You feel violated?
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
What'd he say?
Really?
Nah... scotch.
Of course! That's exactly what I want.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Amazing.
Uh-huh.
How many sessions have we had now, Doc?  Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit.
How's it coming?
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
I can tell you anything else.
What it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. Every time I'd leave a life, it felt good. Whatever problems I was having were suddenly gone. I had no friends and I didn't talk to my family. The only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
Did you carry a gun?
You know how easy it is. A kid can manage it if he wants a fake I.D. You can do practically the whole deal at your local Kinko's. The only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
And a birth certificate is enough?
It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest.
Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess.
It's possible. I don't know about that.
Why do you like to fight so much?
Beni ya little stinkweed, where did you slink off to?
Where's your new friend?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
You shall see.
Like what that Moses guy did to that Pharaoh guy?
And burn the map and retrieve the key.
The hell with this. I'm goin, downstairs to get me a drink. You want somethin'?
We uh,... found... your puzzle box, and we've come to ask you about it.
Every damn day.
What did you find? What did you see?
Oh my god,... it looks like, it looks like a sarcophagus.
Unlike your brother, Miss, you I don't get. You're a whole new brew.
Egypt is in my blood. My father was a famous explorer, he loved Egypt so much that he married an Egyptian. My mother! Who was quite an adventurer herself
I may not be an explorer, or an adventurer, or a treasure hunter, or a gunfighter! Mister O'Connell But I'm proud of what I am.
I'm not?
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
You sure you outta be playin, around with that?
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
I'm staying.
He's here! I saw him! That thing is here!
I was mistaken.
It's called mummification. You're dead when they do this
I can't believe I allowed the two of you to get me drunk.
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
Ah! Ah! Ahmenophus!
She's my sister, actually.
Hey,... don't I know you?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Where's my gun?
Ya know, ever since I met you, my luck has been for crap.
I guess you know just about everything, don't you, Lance?
Who are you?
But she's your mother. You gotta tell her.
I'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. Medicine. Law.
I know... My girlfriends all dumped me after I put on the mask. They thought I'd lost it.
It's me... Elizabeth.
Should I kill them?
Are you with me... or against me?
Thanks for reminding me which team I'm on.
Are you an actress?
Really?
How 'bout giving me "the tour"?
I saw him walk you home.
Alone tonight?
I admire you.
Being a superhero, wanting to save the world. It's so... unselfish.
It is?
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
Champion's going to bounce back, and I want to be here when it does.
You know what? Underneath all that anger I think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
At the Frankenstein Center.
And it would be the right thing to do.
I'm liking this.
There's a big difference.
But there's still only six of us.
He doesn't miss a trick, does he?
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Like what? Cutting off my own ear?
Or flowers.
Maybe she's right.
Agents?
Firepower costs money.
Wow.
Oh, who gives a damn who he is? I can't take this anymore. Night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
This looks like a job for Superman --
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
Your Majesty knows my affection for him is deep and genuine, and goes far beyond my official role as Ambassador.  But I would be remiss in my feelings for you, and in my responsibility to the Emperor, if I did not say that it is entirely possible that the Emperor will view your refutation of the terms of the Treaty of Tilsit, as the first step in the exchange of a French alliance for an English one -- with all the dangers that might entail.
Proceed.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
I have heard that story but I do not believe it.
Well, that is a very interesting idea, General Kutusov, but I can assure you that Napoleon is no beginner at this.  Whatever analysis you have done on this situation, I am sure that he has gone over the same ground.
You can always tell at a glance whether retreating infantry are being pursed by cavalry, because they hurry along and keep turning around and looking back.  When they are retreating before infantry, they merely trudge along, head down.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
Things are quite serious, I should say.
To be perfectly honest, I haven't the vaguest idea.
Any cannon?
There are none here.
Is this enough to oppose 40,000 men?
Fair enough.
Well, Belliard, what's this?  What are you doing here?  Where is the enemy?
I don't know the details of the treaty, sire, Marshal Mortier sent me word of its having been agreed to, and he said that I was to take the army and make for Fontainebleau.
I don't know, sire.
But did she have the best doctors? Wasn't there any chance at all to save her?
Who is there?
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Yes, I am.
Ah-hh, no.
Hello there, Picart.
Ah, good evening, my dear Duroc. I'm afraid I've been out hunting and I have had a rather bad fall.
Yes, I have, and I hope you will forgive me, Duroc, but unless your visit is extremely urgent, I shall have to ask you to excuse me until tomorrow.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
And he sent you to me?
No, sir.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
Will Alexander be joining us soon?
Thank you, Napoleon.
Uh-hh... yes, of course -- if you would like to go... there... but... I have very little money.
Br-rrr, these sheets are like ice.
Lisette.
Lisette La Croix.
No...
No -- Captain Charles commanded the cavalry escort, and rode outside the carriage.  In the evenings, he always ate at another table.  They hardly ever spoke to each other.
You can't be serious.  It would not be good to become another husband out of a Moliere farce.
When is she supposed to return?
And you, are you in love with any one else?
Yes.
I cannot promise you that.
Promise me.
Open the door.  It's me.
I know what you're doing in there.
Oh -- I didn't tell you... I've seen Dr. Corvisart, and he was very reassuring and encouraging.  He has had excellent results with the waters of Plombiers, and he thinks it would be a good idea for me to spend a few weeks there. Apparently, he sent Madame Le Floch there last year, and she gave birth to twins.
Yes... but, first, can I say something to you, as a friend?
Why not?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
Yes.
You couldn't face telling me what?
My God, what do you think?
God help me -- yes.
How do you know?
You mean you heard them making love?
I am told that Fontainebleau has many lovely views.  I know nothing more interesting than a lovely countryside.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
Not one I should like to rely on. Francis is still smarting under the terms he had to accept after Austerlitz, and he is under great pressure to recover his losses.
Citizen Bourrienne to see you, sir.
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Okay, I know what I want this time.
Yeah.
Negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
Man, Day-Day is my people!
Yep.  I forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  Damn that was fun.
Man, this a cool house.
What's the matter with your girlfriend?
What?
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Yo know what?  I'm starting to like Rancho Cucamonga.
What you mean, so?
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
Blow.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Craig, what the hell are you doing?
Man, I don't think I can do this, Craig. I got the B-G's.
Wait here?  So Cheeco can bite my ass off?  Tell me where it is I'll do it.
You're welcome, Unc.
Karla.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
Oh yeah, why you walking?
You want us to give you a ride?
Hell yeah, I remember you.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
I hope you don't think I'm crazy, but I just had to come in here and show you I ain't scared of yo' punk ass brothers...and you wouldn't have be scared of 'em neither if you had a man like me in yo' life.
Next time, page me first.
I'll be out in about 35-40 minutes!
What it smell like?
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  I still can't figure that one out.
You see that?
Two bullets?  Yo' ass ain't changed. Back in the day, all I had was a stick.
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
That the big one, huh?
I do.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
And some rolling papers.
Get 'em, Craig!
Call me.
I got fired too.
Here's the plan.  You gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for Mr. William Jones.
You too big.
Me neither.  How far is Rancho Cucamonga?
When?  After you get all drunk and loaded?
Hey, what's going on?
Are you going to take me to see Mom?
'Take your car?'
Elroy.
Naw, baby, no lovin' tonight.
Better in San Diego? More opportunity there? What?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying?  Your daughter....?
What?
I knew you wouldn't believe me.
For not believing you.
Good luck.
Yes, I'm listening.
Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it!
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Don't you threaten me.
Yes, sweetie, it's me.
Will you promise me that?
You got anything smaller?
It's a twenty.
Please...
There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her.
Oh, Jesus ...
For the last time, I don't want it cleaned. Now get the hell out of here!
He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
Where are we going?
You're a big girl, huh?
It's under control.
Yeah.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
No.
Here's what you owe me.  One, two, three, four, five... where's the other basket? Where's Ruby?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
See ye got two more peeps to your brood.
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
Got a good buy in soap, Miz Cooper.
Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Amen! Amen!
You better not sing that song.
John, where's your folks?
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
What's taking you so long about it?
It -- she --
All right boy: where's the money?
Naturally.
Only she won't never let me play with it.
How's that?
John, Mr. Powell has got something to tell you.
I was praying.
Mornin', ladies.
Shall I tell ye the little story of Right-Hand-Left-Hand -- the tale of Good and Evil?
Them kids!
None of your business, Madam.
Nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. Don't worry, they go away.
Since the murder. She was fine before that.
What happened? That needle sank like a rock.
Why's she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
Haven't slept, have you?
Okay?
Jesus, it's dark in here.
And if you can't do that, you sleep.
They got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. So, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
The killer.
If I can't, then you all can relax, because it'll just be a simple case of me being nuts.
Good, then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy when I bring him out.
Meanwhile...?
He's dangerous.
Looks like her boyfriend did it. Rod Lane. Musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
Had to've done it. No one else was in there.
Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about.
It wasn't that serious...
Right home after.
Mother, for petesakes.
And no school tomorrow, either. You take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
I don't think you're going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
Just sleep now, Mom.
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
No.
What is it, Ninotchka?
Good evening, Anna.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I have nothing to hide.
You want this?
You wouldn't like Razinin.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
Count d'Algout, there have been several telephone...
No, sir.
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
Yes, Leon...
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Give me another double brandy.
You want me to go in there?
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Yes. Could you give me some information?
Gladly.
Can I help you?
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
Why do you need my finger?
I don't have to but I find it natural.
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
He takes good care of that.
We take off our hat and coat.  We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile.  Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
And what is your profession?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Room service speaking.
This is a place for workmen.
Must one always be after something?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
You see? Life can be so simple.
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Did you make any change in this room?
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Not white, darling.
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
Our salute will be a kiss.
Much happier.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Those newspaper people?
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
That bad?  Old or young?
Thank you.
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Madame, if you...
Where are they?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Yes.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
My jewels?!
They are here!... Your jewels!... Here in Paris!
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
Uh, he's rushing back from his tennis game, sir ...
He told me to take you to his conference room.
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
The bigger problem I see is this guy who was arrested, McCord -- James McCord -- he headed up security for the Committee to Re-Elect.  He turns out to be ex-CIA.
Son of a bitch.
Uh huh ...
Yes ... I got the money.
How the hell do you have the temerity to blackmail the President of the United States?
Howard, you'll serve no more than two years, then he'll pardon you.
I think he means the Kennedy assassination.
They went after Castro.  In some crazy way it got turned on Kennedy.  I don't think the "P" knows what happened, but he's afraid to find out.  It's got him shitting peach pits.
It's more than that.  It could be more than that.  I want Hunt paid.
This is not a joke, John!
I don't know if I'd go that far, sir.
Is the war worth it?  Is it worth a one-term presidency?  Because I think right now that's what we're looking at.
He's in the dumps, sir.  Agnew.  Every time you have him attack the press, they give it back to him in spades. He's become the most hated man in America.
No, you didn't, Bob.
I don't know, I don't know ... I just know we've made too many enemies.
No, you're not!  You're going to claim executive privilege and you're going to stonewall it all the way -- plead the Fifth Amendment.  I don't give a shit.  They can't force the President's people to testify.
... Y'know Al, if Hoover was alive none of this would've happened.  He would've protected the President.
At least Mitchell stood up to it.
No, sir, you did not.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Three days before, on the June twentieth tape -- the one with the eighteen-minute gap --
"National security priority restricted and controlled secret."
Should we talk to Trini about paying these guys?  Or maybe Chotiner?
We've got to turn off the FBI.  You just go to the CIA, Bob, and tell Helms that Howard Hunt is blackmailing the President.  Tell him that Hunt and his Cuban friends know too damn much, and if he goes public, it would be a fiasco for the CIA.  He'll know what I'm talking about.
Just do what I say, Bob.
He'll need a pretext.  He'll never figure one out for himself.
This isn't a "moral" issue, Bob.  We have to keep our enemies at bay or our whole program is gonna go down the tubes.  The FBI is filled with people who are pissed that I put Gray in and not one of their own.  Vietnam, China, the Soviet Union: when you look at the big picture, Bob, you'll see we're doing a hell of a lotta good in this world.  Let's not screw it up with some shit-ass, third-rate burglary.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
... he'd just found out about Track 2.
Sir?
Get that little fucker!  Great tackle! Reminds me of my days at Whittier. Most of these kids are useless.
Sir?
We could leverage Helms.
Helms wants Iran or there might be problems.  All of his old CIA buddies are over there making a fortune off the Shah.
Did he have to die for me to get it?!
What'd you say?
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
My friends call me "Mister President."
Robert Cushman is a lieutenant general in the Marine Corps, the Deputy Director of the CIA ... and this is what you use him for?
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
Is there something else that's bothering you, Mr. President?
Cuba would be a small price to pay.
Flowers are continual reminders of our mortality.  Do you appreciate flowers?
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
That was a mistake.  The White House was full of Kennedy people then.  It still is.
How the fuck did you know?
Why, you got a customer?
You're fucking me.
Dick, these boys want you to run.  They're serious.  They can deliver the South and they can put Texas in your column.  That would've done it in '60.
Because if you're uncomfortable with the EPA up your ass, try the IRS ...
Alright, Henry -- we're gonna go your way.  Crush this Ellsberg character the same way we did Hiss!
Finally someone who's noticed!  I'm a great admirer of yours, too, Mr. Nixon.  You are an unusual politician. We share a mutual idol -- "Six Crises" sounds like a page from Churchill.
Uh ... not really.  You mean on my knees?
That was Mr. Kennedy.
Did you cry when he died?
Looks can be deceiving ...
What are you going to do about this Allende fellow nationalizing our businesses in Chile?  You gonna send Kissinger down there?
It was illegal, what he did.
Let's get out of here; it's too painful.  I hate it.  We went bowling last weekend.  Next weekend we're going to the zoo. Whoever said there was life after politics was full of shit.
Jesus Christ!
... give me a break, Mary.
I like jazz ...
Mr. President, the press guys asked if you could come back for a minute.
That's right.
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
It is.  We know that.  And it's enough that we know.  Just think of the girls.  They're still young.  We never see them.  I lost my parents.  I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
My God -- divorce?  What about the girls?
De Gaulle's gonna be there.  And Macmillan.  And Adenauer. Nixon can't not be there.
Are you okay?
I do.  I do.  In my own way.
You.  What' you're doing --
You can't expect me to explain that to you.
Whatcha mean by that?
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash.
...I don't know what I do feel like.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
Carla Jean...
We goin' in?
What was the bullet?
Yessir. It was punched out.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
I thought it was a car afire.
I can't plan your day.
I got it Mama.
I ain't got the money.
What's in the satchel?
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
Llewelyn --
Why all the way to Del Rio?
Uh-huh.
No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you.
If you knew, you would have it with you.
Where does he work?
What's this about?
Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time.
Yeah. I know where you're going.
Sixty-nine cent.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
Will there be anything else?
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to close now --
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Sir?
Yes.
That's not an answer.
What do you want to know?
Yes?
I'm sorry.
You tell me the option.
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
It's called a transponder.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
...You didn't take the product, did you?
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
Yeah?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
Uhh, no, we haven't picked a date yet... well, once he dumps her we will.  He's out pricing banners... I don't expect him back.
No, I was just... How you doing?
Oh, yeah, he's got things up and running, alright...
Do you know who I am?
...I... I know what you are.
I am?
"Thirty-two?"
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Of course, I don't know every doctor who works here...
Well, I certainly would have heard about that.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Oh. Of course... sorry.
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
That's horrible!
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
God, that's awful!
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
Guess who I saw today.
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
...this is your sweater, right?
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Lonnie, it's a complex procedure. Why don't you observe?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy...  Who's birthday?
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
No...
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
I... I don't know...
Now, that's really stupid.
Well, why'd you shoot him?
What the hell was that, another statement?
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch.  What time're they coming?
Half.
I dunno... something.  Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
I need to get my goddamn head examined.  You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
If anyone had paid to have that husband of hers killed, it would have been me.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
Is there a problem, George?
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Uh-huh.
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Maybe we're suing him for malpractice. What's his name again?
Her show?
We ain't gonna make it walkin'.
NOW HOLD ON, BOYS-AINTCHA EVER HEARD OF A NEGOTIATION? MAYBE WE CAN TALK THIS THING OUT!
Gopher, Everett?
It's Tommy! They got Tommy!
I guess Vernon T. Waldrip is gonna be goin' on relief. Maybe I'll be able to throw a little patronage his way, get the man a job diggin' ditches or rounding up stray dogs.
Stokes is pullin' ah pants down.
Pappy gonna be sittin' there pants down and Stokes at the table soppin' up the gravy.
Wipin' little circles with his bread.
No, I believe he's a-gonna paddle it.
Pappy O'Daniel be laughing' then.
Now Penny, stop that!
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
McGill. No, the marriage'll take place as planned.
You said -
Don't I know it.
The preacher said it absolved us.
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Who's the honcho around here?
Yes, sir.
Great.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
You... in the Navy?
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I'm doing okay, sir.
Mayo, are those your friends?
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
I know.
What did you call me?
Before that.
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
Well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! You should be dating local boys.
Yes I do!
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
What do you mean?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
Are those for me?
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
What would you do differently?
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
What?
What if she called the cops?
There is not one thing funny here.
So what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
Me.  I am.
Th --
Okay, okay!  Okay.
Yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  You can wait a half hour, can't you?
She's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  She just killed her own kid!
That's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
Unless Daddy comes back later.
Asshole.
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Shut up.
Be quiet.
Nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  Think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  Huh?  We're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  The worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
Hey.
Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
We're not leaving.  I'm getting in that room, and I'm opening that safe.
You walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
Yeah?
Could the child please stop that?
I'm just saying, the man is a problem.  And he's your problem. Wasn't me idea to bring him along.
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
What if they get in here?
I don't know, why?
YOU CAN'T DO THAT!  YOU CAN'T FREAK OUT LIKE THAT!  YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH ME!
Got him!
He'll do something.
He won't even know who it was.
He's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
What?
Oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
Hey... Cy... what now you a righteous Panther man, you too uppity to drink with us?
I ain't gonna tell you no more. No pushing in the neighborhood, especially not on my fucking street. You're killing your own people asshole.
Motherfucker... you stay away...
Naw... I gotta...
Heh, bunch of shines running around in dark caps waving their fists about some streetlight. They're loud, but they aren't dangerous,
You want me to put a man on it?
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
Jesus...
Did you shoot the officers in question?
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
You were. infantry right?
I'd hoped I was finished with all that. But... 
Huey, you're losing me. What are you talking about?
I saw... but...
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
This cool the heat off you any?
Where is he?.
Ain't no one seen him.
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Excuse me?
You're surrendering.
Apology accepted.  Now, on the matter of the specific targeting of officers during engagements, this is absolutely unacceptable.
Colonel Tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.
Rioting both sides of the bay, in Chestertown they burned the Customs House and tar-and-feathered the Customs Agent.  He died of burns. In Wilmington they killed a Royal Magistrate and two Redcoats.
Father...
We'd cover more ground if we split up.
How old are you?
You learned her lessons better than I.
She said... she loves you and misses you but she understands why you can't be there with her.
Where?
He left us.
Thirteen years...
There are a thousand avenues, other than war, at our disposal...
That's five, keep going...
I'll see to it that he serves under me.
Where is he now?
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Who's in command?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
Long time.
Goodbye, Francis.
And congratulations on the birth of your son.
Margaret, take William and Susan to the river shed.  Hide there.  If we're not back by dawn, go up the river to the Richardson's house. They'll take you to your Aunt Charlotte's farm.  Nathan, Samuel, and I are going to get Gabriel.
Gray.
Seventeen.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Father?
Well, it still says some animal got laid down here after, don't it?
Yes, but the rope might be--
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
Yes...I guess so. He was sleeping on the front porch when I left.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
You believe in it.
I don't get it.
Yeah, sure.
No--not right out loud. Their stones speak...or their markers. Even if the marker ain't nothing but a tin can someone wrote on with a Magic Marker, it speaks. Ain't that so, Louis?
Well, there's a dead cat over here on the edge of my lawn, Louis. I think it might be your daughter's.
It's going to be dark before we even get where we're going, Louis. But we can do it...and we're going to.
Is there quicksand?
Whose burying ground?
Wouldn't wash?
They buried their dead and for a long time their dead stayed buried. Then something happened. Half the tribe died in a season. The rest moved on. They said a Wendigo had soured the ground.
Yes.
A little upset is all she was? Because I'll tell you, Jud, my brains feel a little like a nuclear reactor on the edge of a meltdown.
My father used to have a saying, Jud-- "God sees the truth, but waits."
The door must not be opened. The barrier must not be crossed.
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
She's finally asleep.
Thank you, Louis.
Elizabeth goes free!
I'll torture it out of you.
That so?
Now?
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
My apologies, miss.  As you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?
Dare I ask the fate of it previous owner?
It's a pirate medallion.
Commodore, you can't do that!
You're speaking up for him again?
What?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
If an adversary demands parlay, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete.
You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this.
Last time, I was here a grand total of three days.  Last time, the rumrunners who used this island as a cache came by, and I bartered passage off.  But from the looks of this, they've been out of business, and so that won't be happening again.  We probably have your friend Norrington to thank for that.
A month?  Will doesn't have a month!  We've got to do something to help him!
Drink up me hearties, yo ho ...
These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.
We're not going to just surrender!
Hands!  Come about!  Jackets off the cannons!  We are to fire on our own ship?
Fine by me.  We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound.
No ... somone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians.
Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed.
Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it?
Taking stock: you've got a pistol with only one shot, a compass that doesn't point north ... and no ship.  You are without a doubt the worst pirate I have ever heard of.
Funny, I was thinking along those lines.  How about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out to you.
Move!
Because you're a pirate.
How?  The key's run off.
I'd die for her.
It's still against the law.
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
'Bootstrap?'
Sure -- because he could always go pirating.
Wait -- what about the pistol?
What's that?
Do you have any idea where you're going?
Jack!
Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of.  You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can't betray his friends.  What kind of pirate is that?
Yes it is.  I've seen it.
You haven't seen it.
No.
A moment.
How long do you leave him in there?
Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I want you to understand that we are on the path.  The only difference is that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see where the path is going.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
What are you going to do to him?
I should kill you right now for what you did to me!
Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a bath just say so.
Icky!  What's happening?
And you still believe he's going to come here?
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
You have no idea what this is doing to your body.
What are you going to do?  Make me throw it out?
What are you going to do?
Argon is a lunatic!  I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him.  You heard what he said, Nigel.  He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O.  How can that not affect you?
Of course he is, but at least there isn't a security guard outside my door.
When did you...?
I've read they're using it to repair cancer cells.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up!  If you're gonna flip your wig --
Oh no, no, no!  You've got to be able to fix me!  Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!
Got it.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
That's right.
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized.  It's got to mean something.
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
Probably the caffeine.
What did you want my hair for?
Oh no.  They're trying to blame you for the accident.  That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
You didn't think I could just leave you?
Run, Daniel!  Get out of here!
You saved my life.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Mr. Sim?  Do you have him?  He's alive?
And you have him?
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
If this nutcase did take it and has half a brain, he'd use it right away, before we could invalidate it.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Indeed? How interesting.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
That's considerate of you.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me—
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Gallagher!
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane—  —goes out and counts the silverware.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
That's an excellent idea.
I'll tell Mr. Smith at once, sir. Have a seat.
Fine. Have a seat.
Is that so?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
It's all right. You can write your own ticket. A hundred and fifty bucks a week.
I gave you the breaks, didn't I? That hairy chest story!
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it!  Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work.  Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
Why not?
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
—Mr. Schuyler .
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
What play?
I'm not quitting!
No?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
Thanks, thanks.
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Who was that?
What other girl—?
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
You quit trying to stop anybody—
Holy jumping swordfish!
She did—?
Are the cars ready?
Smythe, you've been drinking.
About what? Your marriage to Anne!
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Found no skeletons?
It's haunted just the same.
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
You sir? Uh-uh. You could never be a putterer. Not a good putterer, sir.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
No she's not.
Oh, swell. You know, Mr. Connel said that if things keep going the way they are, I might be seeing that promotion sooner than I thought.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I'm gonna go now.
Oh yeah.
Anyhow ... I really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
You want to get out of here?
... Lover's Lane.
It's six-thirty ...
I don't believe it.
I didn't say that. It's just that right now ...
But it could happen.
Want some bridge mix?
I really don't know.  Ben Miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
No. Of course not.
I thought I was allowed to defend myself.
Hello Mr. Simpson.
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
Oh my God ...  Oh my God ...
Oh God.
Owns the hardware store.
One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
It's in your closet.
What do you mean?
It's okay.
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
Are you sure?
And you're sure about this?
How?
They just grow like that?
Holy cow. Look at that. Had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
McGinty's.
Like when Margaret Henderson makes her cookies for Whitey.  ... Those aren't your cookies Bud.
I had nothing to do with that.
Why?
No you're not.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm going to leave now.
Okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. Where's that remote control?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
Well--I always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then I make the french fries ...
Hi there. You took off so quick. I wasn't sure if you were okay.
Two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
Well ... I'm not sure I see the point anymore.
Well don't you?
Really?
Oh, well--you're just starting out. I mean, you can't do it ...
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
Cool.
Yeah but what are you doing?
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
This is "Fly With Us?"
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
I'm trying to be your friend.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
I have work, I can't leave.
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Yes.
This is Georgia.
...just talking to you....
I don't lie, Jack. I'm about 5'8, blonde 34,28,34. Pretty thin, I work out. My pussy's shaved. My friends say I'm pretty cute, so....
No.
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
Remember last night I was talking to you and I was telling you about my apartment, my rent -- ?  Do you remember?
This is really weird and really embarrassing for me but....uh....  I was wondering if you could help me out with a little bit of money.
You don't even know how much it is.
I know but I....how much is it?
Should I call back and talk to your girlfriend?
....what....?
Hello?
-- you said you did.
I know I did. But I don't.
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
There's a piano in the street.
Thank you.
Sure.
No, no. I did.
Yeah?
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
....No....
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
What?
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
That was good.
What do you mean?
I just wanted to make sure.
yeah.
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
For work.....
I'm fine are you ok?
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
It's fine. I can just get you at your office.
No.
No.
On my knife.
Hello, how are you?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
You do guaranteed sale? etc.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
Hi Walter.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Ok, sir....I'm gonna put you through to my supervisor.
I'm sorry.
Why you wearin' a suit?
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
Hi, Lance.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
How much money do you have in your pockets?
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
This is Barry.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
Seven o'clock.
You can't be late.
I know.
Ok.
Your expenses are your own.
That's it.
What did you say?
Nothing.
No, no. This is bad, something might have happened, we should just --
It's ok. That's alright.
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
You ready?
He did seem a little strange.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
We oughtn't be reading his nasty stories --
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
Has he hurt you?
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Free his mouth.
It's not even noon --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
A man after my own heart...
What on earth would that require?
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
Of course.
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Shut down?
And --?
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
Of course, Your Highness. Nevertheless... cure the Marquis de Sade... succeed, where countless physicians and priests have failed...
My darling, Eugenie, dainty morsel! Get on your back! Let's try it dorsal!
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Don't start --
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
"By the time you read this, we'll be long gone; bound for England or points beyond..."
You'd do that, rather than forsake our love?
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
I wonder. Do you have any idea what you have done?
Intimately. For every sin you have placed on my head I could give you a hundred others. I have been swimming in blood my entire life. But I retain a belief, perhaps you will think it old fashioned, undoubtedly you will, but I believe that private lives should not be public property.
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
He is a Bolshevik. He will have us at war by the end of the year. I think I'm going to run that wheelchair picture.
It's not really--
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
Miss Parsons, I have one additional question for you.
Showing life
Then you better get ready to be the youngest never- was in Hollywood history.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Who the hell's Manolete?
The man doesn't allow drinking or cigars? This is monstrous.
The old man has his own way of doing things
I don't have it anymore?!
I'll hire you  -- right now-
This girl on a dock. White dress. Never said a word to her.
It's 350 pages long.
No, AMERICAN is a blessed title directly sent from God's soul to your mind. We shall never change that! I mean the name of the publisher. Charles Foster Craig doesn't have the knives-out poetry I need. I was thinking about "Kane" -- you like that?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
I --um-- I don't know if I should. I ain't been drinking since I started on this--
Well, at least she's off KANE today
So they're Jews. . .
And they went to the stockholders in New York.
Please don't ask me to do this.
Do you every think for one second that you might have some responsibility for what you're doing?! For cutting and slashing everything in your way so you can have your goddamn movie?!
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
Orson, you wanna take five?
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
They wanna talk to you.
About what?
Tommy, thanks for coming over.
What who's been sayin'?
J.R., glad you could make it.
I saw you fight Bob Satterfield in '46, Jake. In Chicago. You were great.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Harder.  Take the towel off.
Jack! Enough!
Answer me when I talk to you.
Whadda ya mean, whadda I care? Who is she? What's a matter? You afraid I'm gonna take her on you?
Yeah, she's nice.
No, but Jake... how much abuse can you take.
Do you see her yet?
When I'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? Tell me the truth.
Stick out your hands, Jake.
C'mon, Joey.
Well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
So what?
What?
Should I hit it?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
You're not interested in him?
Huh?
Yeah, what?
I went out.
I am answering...
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
I promise I just gotta pick up one thing.
Never felt better.
I said, let's go.
What're you doin' with Salvy? You shouldn't be here with him. Jake's away killin' himself. Suppose he found out.
I'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. What's the matter with you? Aren't you happy? You got everything you want.
Try to understand, Vickie. Jake's got a lotta aggravation. He's been a top contender too long.
This is the baby sitter.
Jefferies?
Name me a better photographer.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
For instance?
His wife took a trip.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it.  Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
She never left the apartment --
Feel a little foolish?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
Ever get an answer?
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Like an old hambone?
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
I'll send you some comic books.
It's about time you got married -- before you turn into a lonesome and bitter old man.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
Lisa Fremont.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
She's just not the girl for me.
You're never going to marry?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
He and his wife splitting up?
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Huh?
What?
Not yet, Jeff.
Who's Thorwald?
Going on right here. It's a big night.
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
That's good news.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
Nothing, thank heaven.
Now, Lisa --
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
What's that?
Friend of yours?
What?
What?
Machismo?
Jim Stark.
You make any sandwiches?
It's just this get-up.  The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Shoot, Jimbo.
What would you do, Dad?
Go ahead.
You sure?
No!
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Hi there.
Jim.  What's yours?
Why don't you come home with me?  I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you?  I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Yeah?
Why?
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
I shot at one of them.
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.  They called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other.  We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  I got out okay but Buzz didn't.  He was killed.
Good Lord!
Do I have to spell it out?
And your folks didn't understand?
Chicken?
Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
Assault with a deadly weapon.
Hi.  I saw you before.
Bully for you.
Who lives?
Where's Dawson High School?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Where can we go?  I can't go back into that zoo.
Oh, Jim!
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Of course.  Drown them like puppies.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
Hi.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Why?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Do you think your father means that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Is this him!?
Don't hurt him...
He wants... your "sister"...
You can't find... what?
Yeah.
No, hey, I like your coat --
Do that again.
One more. Smile. One more.
Ash, you've gotten me enough --
We could live it up and --
NO!
He'll kill you.
You're in on this.
...maybe I die for Nick...
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
Get your own room, Ashley.
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
They'll have guns.
No.
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well.
No, you can't --
So you could get with my sister.
Yes!
Wish I had a brother like you.
A station wagon in Canada.
Wrong, Nick. It's drowning.
I did.
Bring back some memories, Nick?
Rather be back in the Mountain?
At least gimme video poker.
Don't tip.
A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain.
Nnn... nothing...
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
We got five. Putting Ashley outside.
You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six.  Six is me.
No, you're not.
Well. What you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. Running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
What. We all gonna dress up like cowboys?
Ash?
Here ya go, convict. We cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. What you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
I'm putting liquor in the drinks, I'm giving 10-times odds on craps, I got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! Show me another buffet's gonna offer you Coke and Pepsi! Whaddya want me to do?!
That motherfucker --
I got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
My what?!
Merlin, I didn't know --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
Gonna walk out of this shitstorm and right into her arms.
I'm just talking.
What if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. You just don't do it for her.
Oh.
No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going.
Rudy, don't move --
Alamo...
I... sorry, Mister...
Who?
Where was she from, Compton?
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
Bullshit.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
How can you tell?
What's this?
But what is this?
I gotta memorize all this shit?
Sure.
How is he?
Yeah, Mr. Pink sounds like Mr. Pussy. Tell you what, let me be Mr. Purple. That sounds good to me, I'm Mr. Purple.
Not a problem, got guys waitin' for it. But what happened to Marsellus Spivey? Didn't he always move your ice?
Bad luck. What's the exposure like?
How many employees?
Don't ask me that.
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
It's not good...
I can' take you to a hospital.
C'mon, throw in a buck.
I don't believe in it.
I'd go over twelve percent for that.
Dead.
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
That's not correct.
Don't tell me your name, I don't want to know! I sure as hell ain't gonna tell ya mine.
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
No shit?
Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous. I can say I definitely didn't do it, cause I know what I did or didn't do. But I can't definitely say that about anybody else, 'cause I don't definitely know. For all I know, you're the rat.
And I'm very sad about that. But some fellas are lucky, and some ain't.
We don't think this place is safe.
All I can get out of her is she don't care about livin'.
Thanks.
All right -- it's said!
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
Why?
I -- lost something.
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
Yes.
And meet him there.
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
I've got eleven horses.
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Go on, hit me.
You'll live.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
Don't act so -- crazy.
I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here where I belong.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
He certainly could. About a month.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
How about California?
Would they be good to eat?
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
You were supposed to be reading words.
Oh, sure.
No, I won't let you do it.
Alex, what are you doing?
And remember that trip we took to Africa? That safari was so wonderful. Me, you... best of friends... forever.
Help!
It's coming!
Oh my God, the ghost has Buddy! Brenda do something!
This house was built in 1898 by a man named Archibald Keaton as a gift to his wife, Cora.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
Shhh... It's okay.
Are you okay? I thought I heard screaming.
He's right. I should go first.
Hi Buddy.
Dude, somebody's on the rag.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Where the hell are we?
Yes...
Like, I've always wanted to walk on the moon.
He's here.
I know, but I've been thinking --
Listen to me I --
Stop it! I'm just trying to say I think we should take our friendship to the next level.
So, whatever happened to her?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
How about these buns?
Hanson, please.
It was you...
Someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
Cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  Nobody wants to go.
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
Alright, Cindy, what's so important?
What are you getting at, Professor?
Oh, my God. It happened right here. She came home. She saw them.
Good thinking, Dwight. Traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
Fantastic. These kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken Hell House.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
Would you please focus?
My God! Is she dead?
What?
I can do it myself.
Thanks, handyman.
Alright... I might need your help.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Would you like to see the girl?
Oh shit, you gonna take that?
Now you're being rude, Shorty.
Sorry, y'all. My bad.
Get out?! What does it say?
"Ray!"
What happened?
Mrs. Jensen, I've told you. You have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
Why?
Oh God, really!  This is the limit!
I know this sounds weird, Mr. Sutphin, but the Department of Motor Vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of Mr. Stubbins' pupils.
Chip, your ride is here.
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
We can be real quiet...
Ooh, honey, I'm ready! Now! Now!
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
What exactly does this sick individual say to you?
Alright, I'll try...  "Cocksucker". That's what she calls me.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
Dottie! Watch what you're doing!
Did you see her?! She just said "Fuck you" to me!
I'm stoodup! I'll kill that bastard!
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Beverly, are you alright?
I saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
And those were your scissors found sticking out of Mrs. Sterner's stomach, weren't they?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Man, that one made me puke!
Are we leaving?
SHE DID IT! Aimed the car right at Mr. Stubbins and mowed him down!
The name may not mean anything to you, young lady, but say the word and I'll have your sister for you in forty-eight hours.
Where?
Yes.
 I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.
Hello, Frances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
"The Dante?"
Do you know what this is, Frances?
What did she want to know?
She showed me a drawing.
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Weren't you afraid?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
Yes, of course —— but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Oh, I had business with a man... but I missed him -—
Any court in the land would understand. We'll wait a few days -- let you rest -- then we'll go to the police.
But I'm not joking.
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
Yes. And now that I've shown you that I know that much, and can guess more -- will you trust me to look for Jacqueline?
But you're always at the library.
My window - - through which I see the world.
I had begun to write again -—that's whet I was doing when you came in.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk, for you to get me these books?
I know the others -- Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns. But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
Unless what?
I never thought you did.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it —— your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
Your sister - - have you heard from her lately?
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Because I have something very important to do.
False alarm.
Television?
No. Why?
Oh. Well, I did. I was in a band once, and the music was always secondary to just flat out offending as many people as possible.
You mean like "time flies"?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
Does it bother you?
What?
Of course not.
It's a personal project I'm working on.
All of these are interviews?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Can't.
So you lied to her?
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
I... I can't answer that precisely.
No.
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
Graham...
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Yes. I just got busy.
Jesus Christ, where'd that come from? I have a late lunch by myself and now I'm fucking somebody?
Well, are you?
Always the lawyer.
I don't, either. I mean, Cynthia, of all people. She's so...
Isn't therapy helping at all?
I want out of this marriage.
Do you have any idea what triggered this concern?
This unexpected visit notwithstanding, how are things with John?
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you.  I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
No!
No, it's nothing like that.
Questions about sex.
Why did you do that?
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
She called you that, too. May I ask why you're here?
Nope.
Talking.
About what?
I just want to ask you questions.
I turn on the camera. You start talking.
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
No.
I am now recording. Tell me your name.
When I was fourteen.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Is that what he tells you?
Hello.
Okay.
I never do more than one. I'm sorry.
I can't talk you into it?
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Could be risky.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
Oh.  Well, when, then?
It's just so blatantly stupid, I have a hard time believing you did it.
I like the way he dresses.
Jesus. I could almost understand it if he was screwing these people, almost. Why doesn't he just buy some magazines or porno movies or something?
It just wasn't a smart thing to do. Did you sign any sort of paper, or did he have any contract with you saying he wouldn't broadcast these tapes?
I can't believe I let him stay in my house. Right under my nose. That deviant fucker was right under my nose and I didn't see him.
Plenty of room for two people.
What do you think the Greeks would make of that outfit you're wearing?
I wish I didn't have to live someplace.
One moment.
Mr. Millaney?
Mr. Forman would like to see you in his office.
OK, then. I'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
Dr. St. Luc? Detective-Sergeant Heller. I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Well? Supper at my place?
We live in 703.
It's Dr. St. Luc, Mr Spergazzi. Let me speak to the nurse, please.
Didn't seem worried about them.
Well, let's wait for the X-rays.
Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and...  ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
Rollo, you know me. Once a GP, always a GP.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
What?
I know he's boring but... Neuro-specialists!  That sounds pretty drastic.
Can I just 'peep in' on Brad before I go home?
Dear old Bert's settled everything.
Everyone loves the girl next door, particularly Farley.
With Fast Food Farley at the helm it'll be TV dinners from now on.
Now Betty, don't overreact.
Look.  Look at that.  Bert Schnick can see.  Why...he's...dancing.
I don't want to get up there.
I'M LOOKING FOR LOVE
I'VE TOOK AS MUCH OF YOU AS ANY MAN CAN
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR THEIR LOVERS
Well...maybe I could wear my black leather brogues?
Could I do that later?
Oh my poor baby.
They call it a new look at an old favourite I copied it from the 'Window on the World' show.  The Far East meets the Mid-West!
Just what the Doctor ordered.  I know.  Come on in, my favourite show's just started.
Poor Brad.
You shouldn't have said that.
Janet!  Where's that lovely dress I made you?
I'm sorry, Officer.
Thanks Officer Park...Vance.
No!  He's never done that before.
Flavors!
Fast!
OH ROMANCE IS NOT A CHILDREN'S GAME...
And you liked fucking him, didn't you, you fat little whore?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Don't dismiss me. I'm trying to include you in this decision. He's your friend.
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
And?
They're just leftovers.
Hey, guys. How's it going?
Stephanie.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
Anything I'd know?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
I'd rather have a knife.
How would you rate this one?
It's not even a mile.
Then it's a good thing.
Yeah. Tight.
You know her?
She is very hot.
Perfect.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
She what?  When?
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Aye-aye, captain.
Where is Stephanie?
What?
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Obsessively.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
We gotta slow down.  I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
Let me use your phone.
What's that supposed to mean?
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
No way. No way.
Please, Miles, please.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
What the fuck!
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
You want to join us?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Hey.
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Well...
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
Okay.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Victoria.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Hello?
I am.
I'm pregnant.
Should we get dessert?
So what are you up to today, Miles?
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
You talked to Wendy?
Only for pee or poop.
No.
Does it hurt?
You don't mean it. It's just for show.
Yes.
Chicken Teriyaki.
What are you doing?
How many died?
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
No.
Tell me something Morgan. In that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
What about Isabelle?
French toast... and mashed potatoes.
Don't call me Father.
What's that?
Sounds like a virus.
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Is anything missing?
Don't do it!
What book!
All I did was kiss a girl.
That's why they got you in jail?
Well, Kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but I think you'd have to say I killed old Murdo. I think that's definitely the word.
I almost didn't.
I just came out to say goodbye.
You must have known that before you came.
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
I've got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I haven't done anything.
Two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you're riding hung around.
Where's the pinto going?
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
You haven't got any money.
Yeah?
Cobb, I want you to meet Emmett. He's a friend of mine.  This is Sheriff Cobb.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
What happened?
Yeah, that's what happened with me too.
Get out of here, Jake.
You can't do this.
What's all this then?
I see you're prospering without me.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
I'm not thinking about your future, Paden. I'm worried about Stella.
What's she got to do with it?
The world is what you make of it, friend. If it doesn't fit, you make alterations.
My compliments to you, Miss Stella. This is what I call a saloon.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
So-called?
I've got a place I can hide her.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
-- Illuminate hearts and minds with a ray of truth.
Why isn't she with you?
Don't thank me.  It was entirely Simone's decision.  Do you have Simone's check?
Well, something has to be done about this budget.  It's completely unrealistic.  You allowed nothing for limousine service.
She'll drive herself.
-- I guarantee she won't gain an once.  She's very disciplined.
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor.  Is she really having your baby?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice.  It's strange.  I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows?  She certainly doesn't need you.  Some people even say you're holding her back.
Why stop at one character when you can have a whole cast?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart.  She was the most vital woman I ever met.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
Obviously, this can't last.  She's going to dump him.  Viktor won't be able to take that.  He's too sensitive.  It'll destroy him.
You look so, so...
You're with me to be close to her?
Because, you have to understand, Frank, these interviews -- none of this is real.  Who I am on screen and who I really am are two totally different people.
Let's talk about the work that you care so much about.
Viktor, Clyde simply has to get close to Simone in this scene!  He has to touch her.  He has to!
I've seen them all before.
You already do.  But my actor won't get old, fat, lazy or drunk -- won't throw tantrums, demand a body double, script changes or a bigger trailer.  The Disney Corporation has been using artificial actors for years.
Me too.
I know plenty of boys.
I do.
So that accounts for the lack of a shadow in reel six?
Really?  Too bad.
She thinks you're with Simone.
The old Viktor Taransky.  I liked you better before -- before all this.  You were a loser, Dad, but at least you had integrity.  I can't stand to see you like this -- clinging to Simone's coattails -- it used to be about the work, and now it's all about her.  And then she's not even grateful enough to thank you.
There you go again, blaming yourself.  Can't you see what she's done to you -- she's taking advantage, mocking you.  You deserve better than Simone.  I've got to go, Dad.
You certainly will if you go to trial -- a jury in this kind of ugly mood.  You've killed an icon, for God's sake.
Do I know you?
This is the story.
Nice boat, Taransky.
That won't be necessary.  Sooner or later I knew you'd crack this thing, Max.  You got me.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
Don't you?
Shutter bugs camped outside any place he goes, every concierge and maitre d' on the take.  But this Simone woman is good.
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
It's a hotel.
-- Nicola!  How was your massage?
-- Is this about the new pages? -- I made the changes you wanted, you're in virtually every scene --
You'd cosmetically alter Simone to look like me?
Good.
Hi.
I'll do anything to please you, Mr. Taransky.
Simone, are you there?
Let's take it down a notch.
A star is...
The only real truth is in the work.
You're a doctor. What kind?
We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything we wanted... I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma started crying.  I don't draw like that anymore.
He hates me.
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
What makes you think that?
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
Are you wigging out?
Yes! I think that's right!... I think they all want that. Even the scary ones...
What?
Someone got hurt.
That's not correct. Where'd you hear that?
Like what?
What are you talking about?
Could take a little while, though.
Bitch.
Slut.
Hey! Don't use all the hot water!
You have a strong unfufilled desire.
I could. You sucked.
Curt Cobain.
Are you crazy?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
How... was she "called?"
Was. You ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
Maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
Let it go.
Getting ready.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
Hell, Jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
That young lady heard you say 'squid.' She's gonna go out and create a Goddamn hysteria!
Sorry.
Pretty, ain't they?
Maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
Are you nodding?
Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Megan Halesy' little sister.
Hell, what am I holding back for? Why don't you just give me everything you got here?
It's just a work thing.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
And you said the worms are part of him. They're all linked, like one creature?
You know, you may think you're gonna get away, but I promise you, everytime you turn around, I'll be there, breathing down your neck.
Get your hands off my daughter!
What's he get if he wins here?
I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
I got a boy running in the Peach Tree Classic tomorrow and when he wins, I wanna celebrate in style.
Kate McConnell.
I give up.
What the hell's going on?
Shoot.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Jesus!!!
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
Kate...
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
What can I say?
Yes.
Order up!
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
What are you doin' now?
Bandit?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
What does the old Timex say?
I'm at marker eight-five.
Never mind. It's nothing.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Pop, a K-Whopper's worth seventy thou.
Have any trouble getting here?
You pass that funky Cobra on the highway?
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Where the hell are you?
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
And a very bad gamble.
What about the hotel staff obstructing us. Israel's obviously paid off the management.
Yeah. Have you been able to get through to the Nomad's security?
You're sure?
Yeah.
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Mmm-hmm.
If I needed your I.D. and your car and me and my brothers were wanted by the law, I woulda killed you to get 'em too.
Oh hell yeah. We's just in the wrong place at the wrong time. So don't feel so bad dude.
I've got concerns.
-- Forget about the tissue damage you're doing to the heart itself. Sustained cocaine abuse will segue you from a very painful ventricular fibrillation into full cardiac arrest.  Buddy, nobody knows about your condition, or your drug use. Why you lied to me, knowing that I'd find out anyway, I'll never know, but it imperative now that I see you.
What happened?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
It's the last place they'd look.
Here. Sit.   Please.
No... We're trying to save Heller.
...while Carruthers and a dozen others lie dying, you debate semantics. The Bureau's betrayed us...  The way they betrayed him...
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
You love her?
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
True?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
Forty-five apiece for you two, ten percent finders fee for me.
I can trust Rheya.
Where's Sartorius?
How much sleep do you need?
How long can you go without sleep?
Probably.
I wish you'd told me.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  Why now?
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
I need to see Snow.
I'll go with you.
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did she do it?
You don't want me.
What's happening to us?
Who are you, then?
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
I can't --
What are you taking?
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
It's terrific Win.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
I've never seen anyone killed before.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
Urdu and Hindi.
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew.  She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
No dog.
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
What about Neil?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
I can't open it.
Stop being nuts!
Do you?
I like your coat.
Say goodbye, Mike.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
My ass if falling.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
I had to follow her to a store.
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
What did you do tonight?
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all.  I'll talk to Garber about it.
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
I just sat and listened.
At my house...!
Bullshit!  Prove it.
Under the table.
God!  Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...!  God!
How about dinner tonight?
And Flash isn't?
S'funny.  When your mom and dad, uh, passed away, I had this idea. I wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
When you won that scholarship, I was proud of you.
A little bunny I saved from dissection.
Come on, that's pure luck!  The guy was in the right place at the right time--
Mr. Jameson--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Huh?
Eugene.  Admit it, Peter-- you'd do anything for a nickname like "Flash."
It's a lot of ground to cover. We'll try.  Funny coincidence, huh?
Ick.  And those foul chemicals in the pots--
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
I will finish what I've begun…
All right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we're all we've got.
Peter, what can I do for you?
Pretty lame for such a smart kid.
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
I don't think I'll be running into him.
Good. We'll make it oral for now. Meet me at Rockefeller Center at six tonight.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
You're sure you're all right.
A messianic complex is nothing new to Octavius. In  his universe, there's only one mind-- his own. It must be very lonely.
What's the match gag?
Ready?
There's only one pair left.
I grease the Kraut guards. With ten percent of the take.
Have a cigar.
Don't ask me. Price was elected Security.
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
Lieutenant Dunbar? It wouldn't be James Schuyler Dunbar? From Boston?
Twenty-five.
Shut off the moaning, or we'll have the dogs on us. Shut it off, Lieutenant. This is orders!
Sefton!
What are the chances busting out of here?
Quite a transportation jam we are having outside of Frankfurt! They are very angry in Berlin. They will be even angrier on the East Front, waiting for that ammunition train. Don't you think so, Lieutenant?
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Very well. If you insist on details. I have ways of finding out about that blasted time bomb. Good day, sir.  You will forgive me for receiving you like this?
Jawohl?
'We will remove the iron stove -- the one that was camouflaging the trap door.'
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
What d'ya think, jerko! You're the award!
Ain't that too bad! Tomorrow he'll have to suck a raw egg!
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar!
Cut it out. Animal! I'll fix you up with a couple of those Russian women!
She'll never forgive me!
You don't want to cry over a dame that doesn't even know you're alive! Snap out of it!
I've been crazy about you for years. I've seen every picture you've ever made six times. I'd just sit there and never even open that popcorn bag.
Yes, Sergeant Hoffman?
Anything else?
Good evening, Sergeants.  A bit dank in here, isn't it?... Where is the Baracken-Fuehrer?
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
You'd better cut out in back of the south latrine.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
You take it out. Only you're going to have a riot on your hands.
You taking Dunbar?
You could use a new one yourself.
Suppose you just sit down and keep your mouth shut.
Stop that, will you!  Those idiots! So they sprang Dunbar! So what good is it? He's still in the compound, isn't he? How long can he last? Where can they hide him?
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
How would you like to give Frau Schulz a pair of silk stockings for Christmas?
Talk what? I do not know anything!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Just get us a couple with big Glockenspiels.
Did I interrupt something, gentlemen?
Look at all that meat. Isn't she the bitter end!
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Are any of them inhabited?
Population?
I get it. I get it.
Guinan. It's important that you tell me what you know. We think Soran's developed a weapon...a terrible weapon. It might give him enough power to-
That ribbon isn't just some random energy phenomenon travelling through space. It's a doorway. It leads to another place- the Nexus. It doesn't exist in our universe and it doesn't play by the same rules either.
Soran may still be obsessed with getting back. And if he is, he'll do anything to find that doorway again.
All of us.
What makes you think things will be any different this time?
You left spacedock without a tractor beam?
Antonia?
Captain of the Enterprise, huh?
Did we do it? Did we make a difference?
I thought you might.
Hmm,  Inform Starfleet Command. This could indicate a new Romulan threat in this sector.
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Counselor. What can I do for you?
Doctor Soran?
Nothing for me.  I understand there's something urgent you need to discuss with me.
You must think I'm quite the madman.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The royal...studs?
Sensor records show a solar probe was launched from the observatory a few moments ago.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Aye, sir.
What's going on? When do we get paid off...?
I'd swear something was there sir, but I might have imagined it.
Sir, the shields... Non- responsive.
All right -- get your gear. I'll put you down next time around.
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
There <u>shouldn't</u> be any. Only plant forms were built into the Genesis matrix.
Saavik to Grissom. Request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
Logic indicates that is the case.
Why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
If I hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
Days... Maybe hours... Protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  I'm sorry.
If equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
As promised, she's all yours, sir. All systems automated and ready. A chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
... We have cleared Spacedoors.
Excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
Estimating Genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
If I read this right, sir, we have full power.
No, sir, no response.
Will you be able to handle that...?
Welcome aboard, Admiral.
Admiral, I don't understand. The Enterprise --
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
Out of the question! The Council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to Genesis!
But, why?
Spare me your human platitudes, Kirk. I have been to your Government. I have seen the Genesis information, and your own report.
He would not have spoken of it openly.
... No...! ` Kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. Sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. He touches Kirk with gentleness as Jim recovers, opens his eyes.
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
Perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
1,000 Kellicams, closing!
But surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
You amaze me, Commander.
It's new -- have you any idea what you're saying?
Physician, heal thyself.
But I'm allergic to Retlax.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Shore leave, Admiral.
<u>Will you please be quiet</u>!  Commander Chekov, this is completely irregular. Who gave the order you are quoting? Who gave the order?
Message breaking up, Carol. What's wrong? What's wrong?
Will you please be quiet! We must have order here.  This has to be some sort of mistake.
David --
I told you! I told you I saw a --
A criminal, Captain -- a product of the late 20th Century genetic engineering --
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Where's Dr. Marcus --
How soon --
But good words. That's where ideas begin. Maybe you should listen to them.
So am I. My friends were killed, too.
I was wrong about you. And <u>I'm</u> sorry.
They won't --
At them! At them! FIRE! FIRE! Why can't you?
Departing dark side, Regula.
You still remember, Admiral. I cannot help but be touched. Of course, I remember you.
Don't play with me, Kirk, my hand is on the phaser control --
Thirty seconds...
Listen to me -- you men and women --
Mr. Scott, the word is given.
So you said at the time. Speaking of which, your prot‚g‚'s first rare -- a trifle emotional --
The Enterprise. I must check in before your inspection. And you?
There's a first time for everything, Admiral.
I would not presume to debate you.
Twelve hours and forty-three minutes, present speed.
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Scanners and sensors still inoperative. There's no way to tell what's  inside the station.
Spock...!
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
Any suggestions, Admiral?
A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
I wish to thank you for the high efficiency rating.
That was a little joke.
Begging the Admiral's pardon: General Order 15: 'No  flag officer shall beam into a hazardous area without armed escort.'
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
I changed the conditions of the test. I received a commendation for original thinking.  I don't like to lose.
Regulation 46-A: 'If transmissions are being monitored during battle...'
Two minutes, ten seconds.
Admiral on the bridge!
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
We commend the soul of our brother departed. We love we commit his body to the depths of space.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
Back home, we call him the miracle worker.
We've done it before.
It doesn't look all that different.
Umm. Well, just wanted to say -- nice to have your katra back in your head, not mine.  I mean, I may have carried your soul, but I sure couldn't fill your shoes.
Angels and ministers of grace, defend us.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Fundoscopic examination --
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
Like what?
Yes, sir.
Can you protect us?
To hunt a species to extinction is not logical.
Thanks.
Go ahead.
You know, I could take those whales somewhere they wouldn't be hunted.
Hm?
What do you mean now?
Well, why didn't you say so? Why all the coy disguises?
So. There we are.
Steady, now. We need your help.
You tricked me.
A distinct possibility, Admiral. The President did say the transmission was directed at the Earth's Oceans
As suspected, the Probe's transmissions are the songs sung by whales.
The Humpback was indigenous to Earth. Earth of the past.
In progress, Admiral.
I see.
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
What else did you learn from your mind meld?
No word since beam-in. We can only wait for their call.
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
I have no control, sir!
Admiral, I am receiving whale songs.
I've found Chekov, sir: he's in emergency surgery right now.
Estimate range, ship to whales!
They're giving out. De-crystallizing.
I can't believe we've come this far only to be stopped by this!  Scotty, is there any way dilithium can be re-crystallized?
What is it? I thought I told you never to call me --
I'm ready Spock. Let's go find George and Gracie...
Mr. Scott, don't make jokes, we are in danger of -
It's under water! There's no way to reach it...
If you'll follow me, Professor --
I notice you're still working with polymers.
As I recall, I opposed your enlistment in Starfleet... It is possible that judgment was incorrect.  Your associates are people of good character.
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
There's an unusual metaphasic radiation coming from the planet's rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.
The craftsmanship is extraordinary.
Don't you ever get tired?
But you've never had adults telling you what to do all the time... or bedtimes... or having to eat food you don't like...
For what purpose?
Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
Tournel will take you the rest of the way...
Can he breathe under water?
The artificial lifeform was right?
They all have slightly elevated levels of endorphin production... probably the result of the environmental anomalies here...
Are they in any danger?
She's stabilizing.
Captain, Geordi...?
'his nose should pant and his lip should curl...'
It is clearly Federation in origin, Captain.
Incomplete, I might add.
Take us into a high orbit.  Lie down, Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face...
I'll order Riker to turn around.
I do not take orders from you.
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
You're not finished here?
There are six hundred people down there. We'll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to help billions.  The Son'a have developed a procedure to collect the metaphasic particles form the planets rings...
A planet in Federation space...
I wonder... which one of us will be facing that court-martial...
We're about to lose communications with Starfleet, Captain.
A photon torpedo.  Isn't that the universal greeting when communications are down?
Full impulse.
Options?
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
'Yew-cheen chef-faw.'
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba'ku relocation while they conduct a top-level review.
Worf, you must hurry...
The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
What...?
Initiate launch sequence.
We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
Yes...
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
It may not be that simple. This is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh?
There is a perimeter alert. A ship has entered sensor range.
Your diagnostics are in error. I need weapons.
The vortex is collapsing, sir.
Who are you?
What did you do to the batteries?
How serious is the damage?
I'm picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
Captain --
Solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
Ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
The inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... I don't think Cochrane built this thing for comfort.
Their com system must still be down.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Active.
Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force.  And you are?
Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now.
Yes.
What do you want?
The invasion plans.
Bed sheets.  I used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. Not the best material, but I haven't seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
"Money." So you can get dome money...
You're lying.
A key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
Captain...?
Hull integrity down to thirty percent...
Looks like they damaged the silo...
Just a little queasy...
No response.  I'm not reading any Starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
Mr. President.
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Sweet Jesus...! He's lost a lot of whatever this stuff is...
No!
- <U>Kobayashi Maru</U>...
Well, don't be too hard on yourself - we all felt exactly the same -
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
Stand...?
I was nervous -
I tried to save him! I was desperate to save him! He was the last best hope in the universe for real peace.
It takes a lot of effort.
I've always wanted to meet you, Captain.
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
Are those your words?
Yes...
For insubordination.
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I did not witness.
I am.
Now we go to Starfleet?
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
An accident wasn't good enough...
Fraid not. It wouldn't fit him, anyway.
We don't get many presidential assassins.
Sorry -
I gather you are not enthusiastic about the assignment... I don't think many on board are.
Saavik, you know anything about a neutron energy surge?
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
DON'T TRUST THEM. DON'T BELIEVE THEM -
What the -
Can we two have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?  Would that constitute a joke?
Captain, perhaps we're going about this the wrong way; our job is to get to the conference; HER job will be to stop us.
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Her own father...?
Very well. For twenty-four hours we'll agree that this conversation did not take place.
Sorry to wake you, sir, but Starfleet urgently requests any data we may have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
According to this we've completed our exploration of the entire sector.
That could take hours!
And if they're still in place?
They don't place the same value on life that we do, Spock - you know that... take my word: she didn't shed one bloody tear...
If another ship had been beneath us the Klingons would've seen her!
No, I have only activated your cognitive and communication subroutines.
Indefinitely.
Beverly, come in.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
Aside from slightly elevated adrenalin and serotonin levels, you're completely normal.
But the Romulans abandoned the plan.
So... To happy endings.
Will and Deanna joining the Titan. Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical...
Now, you make a toast.
Data!
It'll only work for one of us.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
How many of you did Dr. Soong make?
I can't believe the Captain went along with a memory download.
What purpose does this serve?
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
No.
If you wouldn't mind.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
I'm going to miss you.
How can you be certain?
I'm only half human.
It's going to take some time to find out -- the data stream was rerouted through substations all over the ship.
It's called a Cascading Bio- genic Pulse. The unique properties of Thalaron radiation allow the energy beam to expand almost without limits. Depending on the radiant intensity it could encompass a ship... or a planet.
What's he doing?
Aye, sir.
You have the bridge, Commander. Use all available power to move away from the Scimitar.  Now, Mister La Forge.

With or without the rest of the fleet?
Understood.
Praetor Shinzon, I'm pleased to...
Captain!
Thank you, sir...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Sir --
It's an old psychological strategy, Number One. To put him in a position of dominance and make us uneasy.
Praetor?
Yes. The eyes have it.
It amazes me how little you know yourself.
I know... you'll all gladly die to save your home world.
I know you as well as I know myself, Shinzon. There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
Not so long.
That's your life... not mine.
You can still make a choice! Make the right one now!
Praetor, we've received the transponder signal.
He's gentler than I thought. And he has a sense of humor.
Praetor. You have the whole fleet at your disposal. They supported the coup, they'll follow you.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
Do you have children?
Elmo's...
Where's that?
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
What's all this for?
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
Mrs. Haydn...
Ah... no...
What?
What?
Minneapolis... good.
No gas.
Go.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?  Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
No gas.
Who?
In your pocket, please...
I...
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
I need you.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
Well... I'm going to go now.
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
I am not a good singer.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
What are you saying?
Good morning.
Horses.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I understand.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Tell the baby about me.
Help me!!
Help me!!!
I don't know where he is.
What? No, of course not.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Is it for real?
You get that, Lyman?
Very beautiful country up here...
Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car.
You know that's impossible!
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
I made my choice, Lenny.
And then she said, 'Since we're going to be spending so much time together--'
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
I have a gun.  It's under my bed.
Yeah... he figured out what to do all right.
See, if you packed your piece you could've made the guy see sense.
You alright?  Y'okay?
He's been cooked-off
You just did.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Lookit, you see the peak period ratios there?  Could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. Some kind of trauma  This is not good.  I don't like this at all...
Who was just here?
Nero.
Sure.  Whatever.  See, since you shitcanned my career, I don't even have to call you sir.  One of life's small pleasures.
No, wrong... I sell experiences. Sex is only part of it.
Everybody needs to take a walk to the dark end of the street sometime, it's what we are.  But now the risks are outa line.  The streets are a war zone.  And sex can kill you.  So you slip on the trodes, you get what you need and it keeps you from jumping your tracks.
Hey, careful on the jacket.  This is Armani.  You angry?
I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really.
Jesus, Lenny.
She's my destiny.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Shit!
Uh unh.  I won't do it.
We got to make another copy of this. Little life insurance.
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One.  Jesus.  Maybe they ought to see.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
He's totally cut off from the outer world.
Kinda guy you can count on in a pinch.
Okay, we gotta get over there.  Can you borrow a dress from Cecile or something--
I guess.
You never told me.
Mace... you're a girl.
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen?  It happened!  The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America!  Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Besides that.
Pacific Northwest is a hotbed for serials.
Agent Duncan, there's an interstate issue up on 54, run out there.
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
What?
There seems to be a discrepancy.
The man who was with him, he was a construction worker?
Its called insubordination.
Pretty embarrassed, to be honest. I had him.
This time, sir, if I may be so bold, would it be possible to set up my equipment outside CIIAC, perhaps in military housing at Quantico? I didn't get along very well with the other members of the Division. We thought differently.
You feeling okay, Agent Mackelway?
I spoke with Lloyd Daitz.
Watch out for Dick Low, he's a liar; he has his own world. There was a Junior Agent in Seattle, not unlike you, an Agent who fell under Dick's spell. He'd have done anything for Agent Low. Richard got this Agent to take a suspect to the crime scene, beat him up, force a confession -- all unauthorized, all illegal.  The Agent died that night, killed by the suspect. Richard Low got him killed. Worst of all, we had to hush it up, let the suspect go. The suspect was George Sheldon, the second man Richard killed.
You better hope the Director doesn't stop abruptly one day, David, you might break your nose.
Setting up. Technically, anyone in a chat room can be traced back to a screen address. But, by using punters, a correspondent literally punts his address around the world, through computers in countries that have no communication treaties. The correspondent becomes "ghosted," invisible.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
Chat jargon for moving from fantasy to real victims: "I went live last month."
This is some serious shit.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
And one other thing.
He thinks he looks young.
When you were his student? Did he come on to you?
I know.
We got an UNSUB walking around with four feet?
The tattoo?
Maybe we should back off a bit.
That's true.
Hello?
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
You okay?
You're a smart guy. Tell me what it says.
After my hiatus, after I got my priorities readjusted, I drifted online, started tracking porn chat rooms, looking for Zero. Got accepted, came across these boys swapping stories, pictures, downloads. Never found Zero, but I did come across some Class A scumbags.
You? You went by the book?
Is he dead?
[Lionheart, what happened?]
Lead the way, Murman.
[The address is 147 South Rane. It's a lively address. You got a problem with dark meat?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
I've located the Suspect Zero file. Did you know there was one? Koessler ordered it as part of your evaluation.
Thomas Mackelway.
I'm Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI. There is no way you will escape. Assistant Deputy Director Richard Low is en route with another Agent.  You may know Low by another name. You may know him by the name Murman. I am Lionheart.
I know, I know.
Don't do it, Mike.
I'm sorry?
Are you sure? Maybe...
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
I like quiche.
What else?
No... Maybe that's not the case. Maybe she shouldn't be such a smug little shit because she'd be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it's been a long time and he doesn't know if he's ready to...
I haven't heard an official "no" yet.
You haven't told then, huh?
Oh my God.
...And she's with someone else.
Wait here, I'll get you that martini.
You have to lay it on the table.
Huh?
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
Yeah, hold on.
Fine... I guess. You?
Yeah.
I heard you might be moving back...
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
So the only difference is if I forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
Right... or more likely the opposite.
Unless she comes back first.
There's the rub.
...It's just that you've been there. Your advice really helps.
I didn't want to say anything.
I don't talk about her that much.
The only reason I mentioned her at all is to say that I'm not going to talk about her anymore. I thought you'd appreciate that.
What'd you get?
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I think I'm gonna move Back East.
How am I doing well? I host an open mike and I played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. Big fuckin' deal. I'm with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. How good am I doing?
What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
S'up Trent?
What?
Okay Bugsy. Twenty minutes.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
That's not cool.
...but that's two hundred dollars. This is blood money...
Yeah? Well obviously not always!
Don't give me that shit. You know exactly how much you lost. What'd you drop?
Baby, this is what we came for. We met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
She likes you.
You gotta get that girl out of your head. It's time to move on. You're a stylish, successful, good looking cat. The ladies want to love you, you just gotta let them.
...gotta...
Nice, baby.
Baby, you did fine.
You did fine. Don't sweat her. We're meeting our honeys soon. You know Christy's friend is going to be money.
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
We didn't do so bad after all.
What was the part?
"Big Brother", "Little Brother"?
She really didn't do it for me, baby. How'd you like Dorothy?
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
I was younger... It was college. You didn't go to college, you don't know what it's like. You screw chicks you have no business being with. They're young, they don't know any better.
Which one?
We got the digits, baby.
You were off your ass back there! Where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
It's on.
...double diamond...
Baby, don't talk that way, baby...
...And you're just looking at your claws like "How do I kill this bunny?"...
...Anaheim...
...Shut up, Sue...
Sorry man.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Be smart about it.
This is Tom Hagen; I'm calling for Don Corleone, at his request.
No.  You ask for too much.
But your daughter is still alive.
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
What was that?
Yeah.
Go get Paulie, I don't care how sick he is.  Pick him up yourself, and bring him to my father's house.
Clemenza.  You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
I'll think about it.
Thirty per cent.  In the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.
Should I bring him in.
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
What miracles you do for strangers.
I'll need him.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Yes.
Why didn't Moe Green meet us at the airport?
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
Part of the deal: Bruno cancels out what they did to my father.
And when they shot me father...
I found out about this Captain McCluskey who broke Mike's jaw. He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll, and for big money. McCluskey's agreed to be the Turk's bodyguard.  What you have to understand is that while Sollozzo is guarded like this, he's invulnerable.  Nobody has ever gunned down a New York Police Captain.  Never.  It would be disastrous.  All the five families would come after you Sonny; the Corleone family would be outcasts; even the old man's political protection would run for cover.  So just...take that into consideration.
One of Tattaglia's people?
Even Sonny won't be able to call off Luca Brasi.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Michael, what are those men doing?
You know I love spaghetti.
My Father sent Luca Brasi after them.  He tied the two Capone men hand and foot, and stuffed small bath towels into their mouths. Then he took an ax, and chopped one man's feet off...
Then the thighs where they joined the torso.
Michael, I love you.
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
What will your father say?
Shhh, you be the long distance operator.  Here.
I'm thinking about it.
When will I see you again?
Tell me!
You cannot stay here...I'm sorry.
Good.  She's been through it before. Me too.  You were too young to know about it.  You better wait outside; there're some things you shouldn't hear.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
How can you be sure?
Christ, if I could only contact Luca.
Where are you going?
Send some bodyguards.
Mikey, you look beautiful!
Cut it out.
Go on Mike.
I do renounce him.
And all his works?
Barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it.  Pretty soon there won't be one place in Brooklyn I can hang my hat.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Hi Tom.
It's vile.
I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
I hope it wasn't cheap.
Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me.
It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for -- ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! -- it's got nothing to do with my mother.
I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
This is so good of you.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
I'm suddenly quite happy to be going back.
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Oh God, I don't think so.
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
What evening?
Do you think you can steer this thing?
You should watch that!
Hardly.
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Frances?
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Did he kill Freddie?
I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't.
We passed it a few blocks back, where the police were. The Palazzo Gioia. They don't even know I'm in Rome and I'm not going to incriminate Dickie --
Look at me what?
Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
Marge? Where are you going?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Will we see you later?
Sorry, sorry. Had to renew my papers. Italian bureaucracy -- never one stamp when they can make you line up for three. Have you been waiting long?
My God.
What rumour?
In Rome, about three weeks ago.  I knew that one.
He wants to know if you killed Freddie Miles and then killed Dickie Greenleaf?
He's already angry, I don't think --
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
Dickie and Peter, that's just too good gossip, isn't it?
Well that would be even better gossip.
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car.
And when did you last see Signor Ripley?
That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood.
Thank you.
Sorry. No one has seen Signor Ripley since San --
That's an expensive gun.
The .32's $150 -- and you're really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. Hell, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal -- a good one.
I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box.
Is that so?  But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Where do you live?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
That's really something.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ.
The DMZ?
You'd be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. People have patterns. They do more or less the same things every day. I can tell.
What's wrong?
My God!
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
You forgot "sexy".
Just didn't get around to it, huh?
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Is he Italian?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
That's fine.
Not rouge. Blush-On, they call it.
You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Fuckin' One-Ball.
I have.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
I don't want to make it. I came here to get you out.
Listen...
Well, you want to or not?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
I'll give you the money to go. I don't want you to take any from those guys.
I want to -- what else can I do with my money?  You may not see me again -- for a while.
The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie?
There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know.
Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
Also clean.
Some. Here and there.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
So I hear.
Oh?
My name is Henry Krinkle -- that's with a "K." K-R-I-N-K-L-E. I live at 13 1/2 Hopper Avenue, Fair Lawn, New Jersey. Zip code 07410.  Got that?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
Travis.
It happens.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Hey!  Now there's some good news.
What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed.
Well yes I suppose ...
Surprise, surprise.
Partners?
Mason, uhm, John, I have something to tell you.  You know that pardon= contract you signed?
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Whoa.
Do you have the...
What?
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
When did you start smoking?
Your dancing's very good.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
We see it.  For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom."  What's the point of this?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Yes?
Any idea how you got here, son?
I guess I did.
What is it?
Call me... Ishmael?
It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down.
You think he's drunk somewhere?
Take a hike.  Am-scray.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life?
We thought you was dead, you know.  It's okay that I live here?
Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
Please, sit.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Now that you remember who you are, were you planning on telling anyone your true identity?
Who?
Yes?
Yes.
Yes?
If you have some, I'd...
I despise it.
They're beautiful! They're just what I wanted! Is there a man and a woman? I can't tell which is which.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
Mitch, let's turn back.
The little Brenner girl.
See where I'm pointing?
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
It's a surprise, you see.
What name?
The little Brenner girl?
I need her exact name, you see.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Yes?
I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash.
Gulls!
Are you finished here, Sebastian?
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Mother, where did you go to law school?
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Not now.  Not while they're massing out there.
Mitch...
They're gone. The same pattern.
We have to try it.  We can't stay here.  Melanie needs help.  Mother, the house won't take another attack.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Did you close the door?
Yes. I don't think you should leave them in the hall, do you?
Lovebirds.
I don't know you.
Ahhh, but I know you.
We never met in court or anyplace else.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
What kind of law?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
Why... 
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
Yes.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
What?
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
No.
You were lying.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
What?
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Growing a beard...
I'm frightened, Mitch.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
The bay doesn't.
Yes.
That... that... who was that?
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Birds?
Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth.
The ones that've been raising the devil with my fishing boats.
I'm going out that way, lady. You can follow me.
I'm very pleased to know you, Master Fettes.
I want you to help my little girl.
I'm only a student.
Ask this one favor --
-- pain -- and shock.  She's brave enough, but I don't know about myself.  Now that it seems so close, I wonder if I dare trust my child into any but God's hands. Maybe He knows best.
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
Excuse me, Dr. MacFarlane --
Dr. MacFarlane --
I remember her.
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But I -- well, you see, sir, I met Mrs. Marsh and told her.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
I'll have no more to do with it. I'll not put my neck into the noose, not even for your sake, Dr. MacFarlane.
Glencorse -- that's a lonely cemetery, Fettes, not a soul around for miles.
Tosh!  Fettes!  It's not their grief I'm worrying about -- I'm talking of our own end --
No.
The white horse.  The horse that is going to greet me when he sees me.
A doctor?
Then you can understand that the backbone is a lot of little blocks and those little blocks are all held together, so that it works like that whip of yours. You know that, don't you?
What are you going here? Have I not told you --
What I was going to say is this -- wouldn't you be more comfortable at Leith in a neat little house?
Well then -- I beg you -- I beseech you --
But why, Gray? Why?
You're welcome to my little nest, Joseph -- is it not? That's right -- you have something to say to  me -- something very private.
Can anyone hear what we say?
Yes, Doctor.
Child seems to take to the lad. What sort of an accident was it, Ma'am?
But, Doctor, surely in a case like this -- a child -- a little child who can never walk or run --
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
You're not going to Gray.
How many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
You sent them. I had no choice.
Fuck! What do you want?
Where the fuck did you come from?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
What did they give you?
What Scar? What fucking scar?
I heard you were looking for this.
This tree. Here's where it happened.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
Just don't believe everything you see.
Maybe we had a case of that here.  Get me my kit.
Do you believe in ghosts, Nathan? Because there's a ghost threatening us.
Anything wrong?
You wrote this?
It was my intention to discuss this officially -- with all the nations of the Earth -- but I was not allowed the Opportunity. I have come to realize since that your mutual fears and suspicions are merely the normal reactions of a primitive society.  We know from scientific observation that you have discovered a rudimentary kind of atomic energy. We also know that you are experimenting with rockets.
Would you be willing to meet with the group of scientists I am calling together?. Perhaps you could explain your mission to them, and they in turn could present it to their various peoples.
Why don't you leave it to me? I'll think of something.
Hi Mom!
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
Mom -- is there something wrong with Mr. Carpenter?
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Yes, dear. Come on now.  Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
You're just kidding, aren't you?
Well, sure I would, but --  Aw, I'll bet you'd be scared.
Bet he's the only one in the world knows the answer.
Why not, Bobby?
He told me this morning when I examined him. He's seventy-eight.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I -- I'm not sure I understand--
You must have a rather strange impression of us.
You still haven't answered my question.
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
May I see you for a minute?
We'll be stuck here for a little while -- about thirty minutes.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I.  He won't have anyone to play with.
That's what I wanted you to tell me.
They would have killed this man?
Think of this more as a survival manual... there's our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
They're gaining on us!
Did you see that sucker burn?!
Two down and two to go.
So how do you like those maggots, Michael?
Don't!  Stop!
Where's Star, David?!
What is this, David?
Where you going?
Leave him alone.
Where the hell are you from, Kryton???
Get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
Oh, no...
Of course not!
Are we havin' fun or what?
You like Michael.
He's just a deep sleeper.
I'll hitch.
Michael, are you still in bed?
Smells like something died.
I thought we were poor.
He met a girl.
Sam.  Is everything all right?
Can I sleep in here with you tonight?
Ah... I didn't know you were having guests...
I'm not looking for a tape.  What I need is --
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
Something the matter?
Will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
How about a little Parmesan cheese on that?
But you passed the test!
I guess you're new around here.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Now you and David...
That night in the cave -- that wasn't wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  David's blood.  I'm one of them, Star!  I'm just like them!
It's not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
Take laddie.
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
This room is mine.
Do I have to do this?
What did <u>you</u> do last night?  You look wasted.
You don't suppose Grandpa's an alien, do you?
Did you spill something?
What do you want from us?
Look, I know it's hard to believe...
What you doin'?
Fuchs...?  No, it's not Fuchs... You must let me back in... I won't harm anyone... I promise...
Auxiliary light cables...?  Been cut.
You catch anything he was saying?
I suppose... well, it's possible someone might have lifted it from me.  But...
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
Now how's this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
MacReady!
Could be important work.  Might as well bring it back.
Nothing we can do about that.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
Ah... no one... I give it to Copper when he needs it...
Looks good.
Oh, I got you.  Not too long.
How's that Thing get to the dogs?  I though we stopped it in time.
Somebody definitely messed with it.
We going to make it?
Where were the flashlights?
He might just wait us out.
That thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, MacReady.
It's the generator I think!  No power.
The Hall of Books.
What kind of stories?
I know you -- you're an automaton of some sort that --
Please, we need your help.  The Morlocks have taken --
But you escaped.
When was his mother taken?
It frightens you.
Vox?
Alexander... Listen to me, it was wrong to bring you.  You're not going to find what you're looking for.
End...?
You came underground when the world was ending above.  And you evolved. Some into the Morlocks and others --
Say I just come back again?
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
So you take their best...
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
Now will you go?
But you've earned a reward for your valor.  I think you should become. You'll like it here.  Once you get used to the darkness.
I don't think that's going to happen.
Thanks.  Old Nell's my girl all right.  Al least when she decides to move, stubborn beast.
You promised me flowers.
You know I can't.
All right...
Let them.
Alex, this is your first year as an associate professor.  You might want to play things a little more conservatively.
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
Do you have a romantic bone in your body?
Hiding?
I live with it every minute of every day.
I can't leave when I'm so close.
Couldn't help but overhearing.  Two fine young people starting out on the road of life.  I wish you the very best.
We don't have anything like this. Or the machine where Kalen found you.  And I doubt they do beyond the valley... Now where do you come from?
I might find the truth rather hard to understand?... Can you go back?
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
Mara, I had a strange dream last night.  I was here, walking through a forest very much like this, and then...
Yes... After her death, it was intolerable for me here... The future had to be better.
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Well, just as I thought.  Surely it's all been a terrible mistake. This parent actually suggested that your freshman course in applied mathematics has somehow become a seminar on theoretical physics!
No, sir --
Well, I guess you'd call us... New Yorkers.
No...
I am the oldest.
We have to go after them, find where -- !
You know that's not true.
And you've no idea where he went?
I think I might be.  But there'll be some changes made.  I run a tight house.
But... what about Starks?
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I know. [Beat] I knew that when you came out.
I don't understand...
He died because he bled to death from a blow to his head. Someone had to have given him it.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter!
I think I can remember what's on them.
I looked it up.
Do you really believe me?
Yes.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
How long do we have?
Of course it makes me mad. It makes me more than mad. Just like remembering the face of the man who killed that officer and knowing nothing more about him. But what's it gonna do for me to find them now? I can't fix everything in three days.
I might not be able to.
If everything hadn't happened the way it has, then I wouldn't be here right now, sitting in a car with you, touching your face.
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
No. I don't want it to.
How'd he get it?
Well... [beat] let me know how your search turns out.
You have no idea what's going on.
You don't understand.
I don't know. [Frustrated] Remember?
[Beat] I've seen a time that's not this time. And I'm only able to see it when I'm in the Jacket.
It doesn't look all that different.
Why don't you help me?
Because I don't have time.
You told me this was how it happened.
I do believe you...
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I don't know when it'll happen but soon I think, you'll shock the boy and it'll wake him up.
You know how to get there?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Don't you go to jail for that?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
I know you need one when it's really cold.
[Beat] How do you know?
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
I'm not sure.
Well, how'd you get here?
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
[Beat] Why?
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
They told me I joined the army when I was seventeen. That's when my father died and, before that, it was apparently just me and him since I was born 'cause my mom split.
On what?
In the leg.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive?  I don't know. Let us think about that.
A .38.
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
Ask me no questions, I'll tell you no lies.
Well, come on, gal, I got you a room.  You can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
You're in Oklahoma?!
Is that how you answer the phone?
What?
Stop it!  Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now.  I'm not kiddin'!
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Oh my God.
Which part?
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
I'm cash poor.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I wish we could've brought him with us.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  Did you see his butt?  Darryl doesn't have a cute butt.  You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
That's puttin' it mildly.
So what are you gonna tell him?
Put a lid on it, Thelma!  It's hard enough as it is.  Just let me get this part over with.  Now stay here and guard the money.  If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Oh, Thelma.  Oh, no.
Don't worry about it.  You want anything?
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
You think you've found your calling?
Idaho?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Yeah.
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I can see that.
I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity.
Harlan.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Shit.  I'm gettin' tired.
Nobody would believe us.  We'd still get in trouble.  We'd still have our lives ruined.  And you know what else?
Louise?
You awake?
Good.
We can change our names.
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
Where?!
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I mean since then.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
Uh-huh.
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
Here's the info you asked for.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
Nepal? Have you been?
I already know it, Mary.
No, I mean
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
No.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Jai alai?
Good good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
Thanks for picking me up.
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
Bundt cake?
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
An old flame?
What's up, Doc?
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
Hm?
So you're a writer?
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Teddy, hon, are you okay?  OH HEAVENS TO PETE!
No! I was pissing!
Uh-huh.
How are you doing, Warren?
Yes, sir.
Yes.
Tomorrow...
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
I'll do it.
You can't take him out this late in the game.
We're getting everyone together as fast as we can.
Yeah?
What's it about?
Yeah.
I am instructed to tell you that the American Government would respond favorably to an offer along the lines you have discussed. If this solution were raised at the U.N. by Ambassador Zorin, he would find a favorable reply from Ambassador Stevenson.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
This is from the Highest Authority?
Well. There is a new civil rights initiative he wants to talk about.
Tell you what. We're in Connecticut tomorrow for Ribicoff. I'll get you up front with him during the flight.
He was.
Why don't you ask him yourself? You can have him on the way home.
Get back out there, kid. Remember to hit 'em hard.
Have you canceled Chicago and the rest of the weekend yet?
It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
You're sure...
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
Hey. Nice tie.
You're my hero, Carl.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
I thought we were staying on the reservation.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
They're going to kill me next. That's what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are a quiet people.
James Looks Twice?
It's not the first. There's been several. And our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
Who are you?
You crashed my file?
Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn their dead or something?
Water. Worth killing for out here, I'd think.
Who is he?
Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now: remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don't hesitate to empty that sucker.
I'm not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I've just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
Thanks, Cooch.
And it was full of water when I drove by here three days ago. Full. I mean... a river.
Never turn your radio off! I thought I was gonna find you scalped! Damn it!
-- what the hell is Red Deer Table?
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
Come on, Ray. Come forward.
No. Not just a track. You gotta listen to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI's kicked all up. You gotta listen to the earth.
No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get him, I just want him. Shit's been goin' on too long.
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
That's not solid.
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
Red Deer Table, Ray.
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Ray --
You're right about the old man. His power's long dried up. He's supposed to be a medicine man but he won't go see the people. He says we changed, and we don't listen. Well, he don't go out and talk no more. I haven't had a drink in three years but I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this Hoss is gettin' watered.
Do they come in dreams, these visions?
Where was this?
Sorry.
Jesus. Oil?
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or can one take classes?
Mister Tully.
What do you know about spirits? You ain't no In'dn.
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
Well, it is. It is that, too.
Two.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
Um. You.
There you go with those moves again.
I can't.
Harmless!
How about anything, anything you want to do.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
I'm different.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
Lucky charm.
Where'd you get it.
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
You don't have to do this.
How do you play reality.
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
Want to play the game?
Take something off.
Off me or off you?
Well... What   is   it?
Remember one thing.
Sir?
What is he doing?
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
You go. I'm staying with it.
You're not supposed to...
Why do you all have such funny names?
Well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
A plaque?
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
We did it.
He's seat of the pants... Completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. All over the sky. But I don't know, Skip, he's really got something.
Helping him in.
Yes sir.
I can take care of myself.
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
My wife's house.
You may not think so, but you are.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Why not?
Shut up and drive!
Who are you?
There you go, Mr. Brubaker.  Suite 610 in the East Wing.
He wasn't in on it.  You set him off by going to Rekall.
That's now.  In an hour, he could have total recall.
Richter, do you know why I'm such a happy person?
Blonde, brunette, redhead?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
Hey, hey Tony.  Give the big guy a break.
On his way.
Why not?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
Yeah, you did.  I told you not to but you did anyway.
Harry, what the hell is this?
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Is that better?
Mmmm.....
It's not funny, Doug.  You dream about her every night.
Let's do it.
Just think about it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Mars?  You've never even been to Mars.
Let me finish!
I'm not your wife.
O.K. then.  If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
Now help me out here, Doug.  You were interested in a memory of...
As real as any memory in your head.
Go on.
Blondes.
He said there's enough in here to nail Cohaagen for good.
By the way...ever heard of a company names Rekall?
Not bad, for a hooker.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
Are you all right?  Are you still you?
Where are you going?!
You sure about this?
The whole core of Mars is ice.  The reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
I gave you?
Wait!
Ready as we'll ever be.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Burt, can you hear me now?
Burt!  This is Val!  Get out of your basement!!  Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof!  Then we'll talk, okay?!
Let's go you two.  We're headed for the mountains.
Well, we'll ask around.  Let you know if we hear of anything.
We're not going over there, right?
Did it yesterday.  Franks and beans.
How many cows does it take to make a stampede?  Is it like three or more?  Is there a minimum speed?
Handymen, Earl.  We're handymen.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
What the hell do we know about seismographs?
So what if we just did it...today. Pack up.  Drive straight down to Bixby.  Get serious.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
What keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  I was up for going to Bixby.  I was getting excited.
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
You're full of shit.
Slick as snot and I'm not lying.
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
Here's the plan...We don't <u>even</u> stop.  Ride like hell.  Tonight we keep right on going.  We'll walk the horses.
Shut up!  They got wind of something they don't like!
I don't know.  If this one's any faster than that other one...
Son of a god<u>damned</u> bitch!  Been waiting there all this time.  How the hell's it even know we're still here?
I'm gonna kick his ass!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Like hell you are.
Come on, everybody!  We gotta run for those rocks over there!
Sell the movie rights.  We're going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
Somebody paying you to do this?
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
We're here, Val.  Just tell us what you need.  Come back.
Yeah, geography.
Ready?
You paying attention?  This oughta hurt like hell.
Absolutely not. No more than seven percent.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Of course.
-- an angel dust dealer --
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
At the trial, you said you were at your apartment that night. Alone.
I feel like I've been mugged... Guy scared the shit out of me. You made your point, Eddie... I'm relieved we're not taking the case.
...What do you mean?
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
...I'm dying out there.
...You told the Desk Sergeant you were certain Mr. Kim wasn't the killer?  You left your telephone number?
No, s-sir.
You won't remember this, but in '72 I was one of several prosecutors assigned to the Black Panther-Police Shootout.  We had a whole team, and you walked into court by yourself and kicked our collective butt.  So what've you been up to since then?
Back in the Seventies I spent years putting away gangsters in a Colombian syndicate called "the Ochoa". These guys are very dangerous, Ed. When I hear that a small-time dope lawyer is conniving to spring one of these guys, I see red.
What am I looking for? You're the one talking deal.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
But I'm a quick study. Tell your Deputy D.A. -- Rabin? -- that I'll see him in court.
You don't speak any Chinese dialects? Then you get your intelligence from snitches?
-- Objection, your Honor! This case has no connection with any subsequent act my client may be charged with!
I'll take odds on Cecil Number Two.
I followed you here from court.
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
Do the rival gangs compete for control of the prison drug trade?
Chinatown. Sounded pretty cold...
I'm nearly out.
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
Did you know Teresa Banks?
HE'S GONE.
Anything else?
Agent Chet wouldn't tell me what the Blue Rose meant.
And neither will I.
Sheriff Cable's already asked me a few questions about Teresa Banks. She worked nights for a month. That's it.
Do you take cocaine, Irene?
Code. If you work with Gordon you learn that right away.
Shorthand. Really?
A blue rose.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
Maybe, later we could take a look.
It's late, Sam.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Are you going to see James tonight?
But I love you, Laura.
Yep. You're right. That's why I'm here.
Bob.
What does Bob say?
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
Laura, you didn't come and see me today.
Did you make me a tape?
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
Where were you last night? We were supposed to get together. You didn't show up.
This afternoon?
Everything, but everything.
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
Eating?
Sex?
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Fish eyes?
I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
What were you doing in my room?
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. Ever. You can tell me anything. I'll understand.
No, you haven't met him. Have you met him?
Did you come home during the day last week?
I always thought you knew it was me.
That's one thing you are going to learn, Shelly, -- HOW TO CLEAN. It takes scrubbing, Shelly. There is no easy way. THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE, SHELLY.
Abrams. Yes. How are you today?
Good.  You ever been inside a hospital?
Well, of course, it's always dangerous...
...that was a Dr. David Gruber's office...
What does it mean?
You would not...?
Engaged to render an opinion. For a price. Is that correct? You're being paid to be here today?
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
No, actually, she was referred to me. She was Dr. Hagman's patient...
Yes.
Yes.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
...and her heart stopped and she wasn't getting oxygen.
Yes.
You reached down into death. Now, isn't that right?
...that's all right.
No, you did fine.
No. No thank you, Doctor. You go home.
I... in that small context I would have... I would have to say 'no.'
I am seventy-four years old.
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Yes.
Thank you.
Who told you that?
I used to be a nurse.
Why is that?
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
...things change.
Ready, your Honor.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
D'you find an apartment?
Why?
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists. The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh? But to give them a chance at justice.
They might. Yes. That's the point... is that they might... you see, the jury wants to believe. They're all cynics, sure, because they want to believe. I have to go in there tomorrow to find twelve people to hear this case. I'm going to see a hundred people and pick twelve. And every one of them it's written on their face, 'This is a sham. There is no justice...' but in their heart they're saying, 'Maybe... maybe...'
Would you like me to leave...?  Is this a bad time -- ?
What...?
You're talking like a drunk.
I... do you want me to leave?
Who told you that?
Not if you don't grow up...
Is it over?
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
Pardon?
I've got nothing to say to you.
Then why don't you testify?
Fuck you. I got a call today from Sally Doneghy...
Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up.
The broad has disappeared...
Hello. This is Mr. Dorchester in Records. We're looking for Kathy Costello...
She told me.
I just saw her.
Yes, that's correct.
You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
What's he like?
Didn't you have something to do with this?  I know you sent word to the Sixth Army Command!
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
Is it possible to go in right after the explosion?
I could wear it longer -- but it's less trouble this way.
Yes ...  Fits better in a football helmet.
What is that gizmo?!
No.  I thought you had them.
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
But they're not human!  Dr. Forrester says they're some kind of an advanced civilization --
We're getting this under control. Won't need any more help.  Over.
They'll understand us, all right!
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Yes, but...
What's up?
Diabetes?
It was an earthquake and it was dark.  I have no idea.
no.
You going away?
Tomorrow night.
"Then their father covered them with kisses and they were safe."
Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted.  I just can't believe it's him.  I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.  Or is that how denial works?
Really?
You got it.  What's happening?
Heather Langenkamp?
Hi.  This is Heather Langenkamp.
Yeah, Julie, I'm sorry.  I just thought...there was an earthquake, I think.  Little one, but...
What's that?
Then what is he doing?
Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.  You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.
Black's fine.
Do you remember the last time you and I danced under the stars?
Yes, Sir.
Raise the inner jib!  Raise the forestaysail!
Come in.
Well, that's all part of it.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
Fine.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
What was that?
Why then.
Hey, shut up will ya?
God damn it man.  I think he broke my nose!
Is it true Phil?
You think Skipper and Alice do it?
How do you know?  They might.
Who told you that?
Who?
Jesus, you never told them?
Shouldn't we turn away?
But you invited is aboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Then what do you think he was trying to do.
And, of course, we are.
Oh, really?
I think you were too hard on Weathers.
Spirits have a way of bringing that out.
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
We'll think of something.
How would you know?
They tell you that?
Why, man?
Much have I traveled in realms of gold/ And many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ Round many western islands have I been/ Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold/ Oft of one wide expanse had I been told/ That deep-browed Homer ruled as his demesne.
What do you think?
We've got a problem.
What are we supposed to talk about?
No way Phil.  Not like this.
He climbed when he was ready.
No.
I can't be sure.
Do you think this is funny?  Some kind of joke?  You lost six people out there.
How'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as Francis Boutillier?
I don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
Don't mind him, Chucky.  You're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of Vaseline.
Everybody knows why she went over Tod.  You jibed the boat.
I didn't hate me so much, I'd feel better wishin' you luck.
So you're gonna be needin' the "blue- bird" pretty soon?
What's Cao Ben?
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Sorry to hear it.
You an indian?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Everythin's relative. Where's that Marietta Pace Fortune? You two didn't split up, I hope.
So who you out sleuthin' for now?... Can I help ya?
That's what I mean... Always looked like you was just knocked out in love... Was real nice to see.
That is my permiso.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's authorized to carry a .45.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
Grandmama said how Sailor murdered a man.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
Sailor?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
What happened to him?
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
So?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
Huh?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
More'n likely.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Lula, you there?
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
One bad car accident...
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
And no AC.
Sailor?
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Oughta make 'em happy.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Uh-huh?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
LULA!!!!
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
Shoot him.
Yes.
Yes.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
What?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
What he means is, it's difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. It lives in the mind.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
Tripp!
Lay off Pittsburgh. It's one of the great cities.
It's fine. It's done. Basically. I'm just sort of... tinkering with it.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Is that just beer?
I know. He started it Fall semester.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
Yes.
Sometimes we have to improvise.
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
So sensitive.
So what's the problem?
Kind of a sign, you're saying.
Walter Gaskell isn't going to send James Leer to jail, Crabs. I know that.
No. But I don't think that matters.
Oh, Professor Tripp? You know, last semester, what I said that time in office hours -- I hope there's no hard feelings.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
Excuse me?
You did.
How long have you been having them?
That's probably not the problem, then. What about your lifestyle. Any major changes recently?
I've been trying to finish a book...
Better luck next time.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
'Fraid so.
Sure.
It's very convincing.
You're not like my other students, James. So what was the movie you two saw?
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
Sounds like a good one.
Listen, James, about this afternoon. In workshop. I'm sorry. I think I let things get a bit out of control.
You cold, James?
Really?
They're glass. The buttons.
Pretty good. I'm friends with Dr. Gaskell, too.
Do you have a mirror? It's the best way to see if someone's breathing.
Professor Tripp? Can I ask you a question?
You?
Oh.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
Afraid so.
That's a big book you're writing.
How did I get here last night?
And... and before that. Did I do anything? Anything bad?
I can't help myself. I don't know what's the matter with me.
It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years.
I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
Okay, James, I wish you hadn't shot my girlfriend's dog. Even though Poe and I weren't exactly what you'd call simpatico, that's no reason for him to take two in the chest. Still, the fact remains that I'm the one who took you up into the Chancellor's bedroom. I'm the one who has to take the blame. I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
That's why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
Because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. Not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
The hell I am.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
You coming?
I eat.
You just worry about yourself, James. Okay?
James. Listen. Things -- things are a little weird with me right now and I -- well --I have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. And if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. That's why I need you to go home. Understand?
Don't worry, James, I'll figure something out.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
He's going with me. You take Crabtree. And his friend. All right?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
I thank you.
Look, Hannah. When you get him home... make sure he's all right. Before you leave. Okay?
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
All right. Take him to my place. He can crash on the sofa.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
Easy there.
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
I don't think I really have a choice in, that. Emily left me.
I heard.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
About the baby.
James Leer.
Grady.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
I know.
I guess you have to go on faith.
Tony. I'm sorry if things didn't work out so well for you tonight. With Terry.
What's that?
Jesus. Is that what he told you?
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
And?
Are you riding with me, James?
I doubt it, darling.
Yeah, you still with Northland?
Beautiful. How's business?
Living across the street from a grade school. Jesus.
I was just thinking of... the noise.
I don't know. She won't talk about it.
How old is Anna?
Cherry.
Huh?
You always carry these?
How does it sound?
Hiya, Walter.
I would.
You going to take me on a nature walk?
Know what?
I was asleep.
Yes.
You sure you don't know nothing about this?
It gives me headaches.
Why's that?
No you're not.
Walter.
Do you have many friends?
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Ms. Kramer.
You said you couldn't make the sound of a solitary vireo. But you did. Beautifully. I heard you.
What will happen if I do?
Can't I stay a little longer?
It was just an idea.
You think reflection is good.
But you don't like coming here. Be honest, Walter.
Then why are you talking about this?
Is that what you are angry about?
I don't.
I know --
You don't know!
I want to talk about it now.
I'd like you to close your eyes.
Why?
Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
In my bedroom, sleeping.
In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
But roughly, how old?
And what are you doing?
What the hell are you doing there?
Did you touch her? Did you take off her clothes? Did you take off your clothes?
I'm only asking questions.
Is that a school?
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Why do you want to know?
So, you're not a dyke.
You're still here.
No you're not.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
Sorry.
How young?
I never hurt them. Never.
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
All three -- in chronological order.
You must hate your brothers.
What?
I don't even know how to live with myself.
Who doesn't?
Sneak up behind me like that.
How you guys doing?
You got it?!  You got it?
What's goin' on, Boss?
Deep and slow, big guy.  Deep and slow.  Just breathe easy.
Okay, Jammer.  No problem.  You stay right here. I have to go there to the end... you'll see my lights.  We'll stay in voice contact.  Just hold onto the rope.  Five more minutes.  Okay?
Not good enough.  We still gotta catch Big Geek.
I don't know how!
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Don't argue, goddamnit, just--
It is insane.
Oh God, Lins... I--
We'll take reading as we go.  If the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we'll back away.  Simple.
Hey, you come on my rig, you don't talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  It won't work.  You gotta know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
Why bring it here?
Is that it?  Is this right?
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Cab One, do you see it yet?
Roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  We're on a tight timeline.
1840... 50... 60... 70...
No.  Just you and me.  We get some proof, then tell them.  Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
How deep?
He can still make it.
Would we see the flash?
There will be plenty of time to talk about it later.  We'll  get married  soon.  That way we'll have more time...
This one is gorgeous.
Say, Claudia, wouldn't you like to climb up with me and take a look over there?
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
I'm sorry. I didn't want to sound cynical. But isn't it better to look things squarely in the eye?
And what about you?
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
Claudia, let's get married?
Then I'll see you later.
Why?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Tell me once more.
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
To do what?
It's as smooth and slick as oil.
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
Goffredo is the Princess' nephew. He's eighteen years old, the lucky boy. And, what do you know -- he paints.
Don't you ever paint men?
Yes, sir. Three times.
And who is she? Does she work in Catania?
Unfortunately, no.
Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
Are you the owner of this place?
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
And here's Sandro.  Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Your mother?
Here I am, Patrizia. I'm always here.
I read one of your articles regarding the disappearance of a girl. I'm that girl's fianc‚.
Is that possible?
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
I'm not hungry.
I'm being punished.
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets?  Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
No.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
I just heard you.
First thing that comes to your mind?
Did it hurt?
Down... there.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
No.
No... do you?
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Why not?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
What the child?
Agnes...
No...
She says my whole body's a mistake.
I'm afraid.
As much as Mother Miriam does?
Of telling you.
Did you want it to come out?
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
Sister Marguerite I think.
Do you know who put it there?
What do you do?
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
Is someone in the room with you?
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three...  It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
Yes.
It was dead.
I remember when you was a little girl Marie. You come back from the movies and you'd say - Mama that ending was so sad... and I'd tell you they had all the happy endings locked away in a vault in Hollywood.  And you believed me.
And you had a sister who died in the convent.
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
You were a smoker?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
And what happened?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
What?
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
What sheets?
Fine thanks...
Pipe!
Right...
Right.  What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
How?  How?  She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Who is he?
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
That's what I have to believe...
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Did you know she was pregnant?
She didn't want any help.
Of course, John.
Well! A boy of your age bowling <U>"hoop"</U> at people. How old are you anyway?
Y'what?
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Leave them drums alone.
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
Ever seen one of these before?
Are you going in?
Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
Yeah, grotesque.
I don't care.
A butcher?
Now what's that supposed to mean?
Is he?
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Is it ... is it, really?
Aye, the big hammer, smashing!
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Aye, I knew you were.
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Aye well, actresses aren't like real people, are they?
They ought to be.
I'm in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Me? Oh, I don't have the time, I'm always running about with the lads ... no, we don't have the time.
Ah.
Will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
Any old where ... but not our little Richard ... oh no! When you're not thumping them pagan skins, you're tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
Well, I <U>am</U> living, aren't I?
And that lot's never happier than when they're jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I'd like to know.
Yeah ... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?
Ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
Hello.
That'll keep you busy.
Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time ... and who's paying for all this?
Why do you always use your left hand?
Give 'em a pull.
Behave...
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Tonight? We can't make it ...
What?
I'm not, no.
Oh yes.
And my nose...
Look after him.
But...
He's been gone a long time.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
I feel like shit...
... I don't know...
Except it will take 75 years to get a reply back.  Don't forget how far we are from the Colonies, Martin.
What's the terrain down there?
Looks like a derelict.
This is Chaz.
No, it's too small, only room enough for one person.
Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back!
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
Computer, what language was that?
Unknown!  What do you mean?
Yes!
Hello, Faust!
What?
Yes?  What is it?
The computer's translated the alien signal, and it's kind of alarming.
Don't know -- Broussard got hurt somehow.
Oh it's okay.  I've had better cag than this, but I've had worse too, if you know what I mean.
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
It's a crude symbolic language -- looks primitive.
Boy, that's terrific.
Hey now, what is this?
I've got 'em!  They're back on my screens!
I keep my mouth pretty much shut, but I don't like hitting.
What is it -- I can't tell anything --
Well... I suppose that star-shaped thing could be the parasite that got on Broussard.  Is that what you mean?
What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold?  That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all.  We'd be broke.
We can use the flamethrower.
This should do it.
If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
Sandy, you want to give us some vision?
What's the frequency?
Doesn't seem much doubt about it, does there?
What'd he say?
What is it?
It's stopped?
Too primitive.  It's a pre- technological construction.  That slab was engineered by an Iron-Age culture at best.
Well, I kind of hate to point it out, but all our supplies are based on us spending a strictly limited amount of time out of suspended animation... and as you know, we used up most of that time in harvesting.
No.  It's just too small to support fauna as big as the parasites.  If there were a native ecology, it would have to be microscopic.
All right, tycoons, let's stop spending our credit and start worrying about the job at hand.
Not a one.  It's dead.
Still worried?
Well... it's obviously intentional... some kind of attempt at communication... maybe it's a symbol that means something to them...
We won't need it then.
That next thing there -- six legs, tentacles -- that's the thing we saw in the food locker.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
That'll blow the ship up.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
What did it do to you?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
God, I hope that thing didn't bring down a virus.
Minh...
Seal everything now!
How many of them are there?
Where is she?
You win some, you loose some.
The door's sealed from inside.  Doc Revna's in there, and it sounds like Ackland's going nuts.
Not yet.
Oh, man...
What?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Communications to auto-shop go through an F.O. link off the main trunk. That's down with the other feeds.
Okay, I'm out of here!
Not too much of the socializing type, then?
How long you been out here for now, anyway?  Three months?
Six month stint on Datus.
Any luck raising Ackland's party?
Don't worry about it.  If the Network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a Marine gunboat from Powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  They can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  All we've gotta do is sit tight.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
Agreed.
Hurry it up.
They...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  I don't...remember what happened next.
Phoebe.
May I come in?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
You're more than modest.
We all come into this world with our little egos equipped with individual horns. If we don't blow them - who will?
- perhaps more than one. There's so much I want to know. I've heard your story in bits and pieces... your home in Wisconsin, your tragic marriage, your financial attachment to Margo - it started in San Francisco, didn't it?  I say - your idolatry of Margo started in San Francisco, didn't it?
That's right.
Yes. I do.
I can wait. Where would you like to go? We'll make this a special night...
Just some coffee.
And tomorrow morning you will have won your beachhead on the shores of Immortality...
All paved with diamonds and gold?
Almost four.
Also with the reluctant compliments of Max Fabian.
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
I never intended you to be.
- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
That's not true!
No-no-no...
I won't play tonight.  I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Let's go sit by the piano.
Of course I knew.
In time she'll be what you are.
Eve was incredibly modest. She insisted that no credit was due her, that Lloyd felt as he did only because she read lines exactly as he had written them.
Huh?
You've already met.
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Sing it?
It's a good thought.
You've heard it. About when I looked through the wrong end of a camera finder.
She's a girl of so many interests.
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
Thank you.
Then without feeling, your guests were also wondering whether the music couldn't be a shade more on the - shall we say, happier side?
No heart to burn.
The audition.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Now don't get carried away-
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
Bill...  ... where are you going? To find Eve?
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
Why?
Why what?
Is it the money?
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
Ah...
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
Find out.
Well?
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
There was nothing he didn't know.  There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
Late for what?
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
How did you get in here?
You were just looking around...
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
Oh, no. I see the play.
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Mrs. Richards.
Karen...  ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
They certainly don't waste much time.
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
I've got it.
Hi.  Hello, darling-
Harrington.
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
What about Bill?
Well...
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Where'd you get all that information?
Eve did mention the play, you know. But just in passing - she's never ask to play a part like "Cora," she'd never have the nerve...
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
You knew when you came in that the audition was over, that Eve was your understudy! Playing that childish game of cat and mouse...
You know, she probably means well, after all...
That depends.
Play it again.
But that was the fourth straight time.
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--I'm smart enough to know my story was solid--
All right, what do we know?
That was fun.  What now?
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
I never scared anyone before.
--you believe in the President, you wouldn't ever want to do anything disloyal.
When?
How do you want to handle Sloan?
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
So maybe Watergate wasn't really about Watergate--maybe that was just a piece--
--Mitchell, Stans, Magruder, Kalmbach--
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
What was the mistake? Do you think it's been rigged, all along the way, leading us on so they could slip it to us when it mattered? They couldn't have set us up better; after all these months our credibility's gone, you know what that means?
What does it say?
--fund that was used to gather information against the Democrats--
--jeeeeeeesus--
Night.
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
I'd really like to see Mr. Dardis.
Well of course.
On the orders of Haldeman?
I thought you guys were supposed to be working on this story--  --you think I like being aced out?
Five hundred; six maybe.
I think.
I thought you had to get to Miami.
Anyplace really public, they'd know about it--they know everything at the Committee, Carl--
So tell me about the Times article.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
Do you think the truth will come out at the trial?
--this'll only take one second--
I don't know titles.
Anything else from Mr. Throat?
--I'm not here.
It was really nice of you to come, since you'd only met him once.
The twenty-five thousand dollar one.  The one with your name on it.  In Bernard Barker's Florida account.  Bernard Barker, the Watergate burglar--
Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Go on.
What's the whole thing about--do you know?
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
Why did they do all this for Chrissakes?--what were they after?
Talk about Segretti--
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
Nationwide--my God, they were frightened of Muskie and look who got destroyed--they wanted to run against McGovern, and look who they're running against. They bugged, they followed people, false press leaks, fake letters, they canceled Democratic campaign rallies, they investigated Democratic private lives, they planted spies, stole documents, on and on-- don't tell me you think this was all the work of little Don Segretti.
Hi, I'm Bob Woodward of the Post and--
I was just kind of wondering why your name and phone number were in the address books of two of the men arrested at Watergate?
Your name, please.
I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
--correction--when you were drinking your lunch at the bar of the Sans Souci--
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
--in other words, you got nothing, you're thumbsucking.
--listen, we didn't make them do these things--once they did, it's our job to report it--
And as treasurer, you could release those funds?
You work there, Miss Abbott.
No, it was good.
Thanks coach.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
All right, I got some scotch.
Single malt?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Why is this?
Me too.  For the most part.
You can call me Ostreicher.
Neither will I.
Why are you doing this?
How did you know I was here?
You talked to Stifler?
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Onions?
Well, you're not.  Oil and vinegar?
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
...I've never tried it.
No.
Gotta go.
Hold on.  You have no idea why I'm angry?
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Well...uh...
Tonight?
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
Victoria...I love you.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?
Uh -- forget that.  Look, is that all you're interested in?  Ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
I'm such a loser.
Dude, prom sucks.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Just like sex with my wife.
Merde! I can't believe this!
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Sure. I can follow that.
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Hello?
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Didn't even have to ask.
God. I can't believe it.
What does it say?
Whoa...
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better.  This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
Merde.
Here.
Two more nights in this lunar cycle.
Why were you so late tonight
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
Providing travel papers is illeagal!  I know Dmitri well - perhaps I can help you.  Providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
I was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
Come on up!
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [THIS SECTION ALSO NOT LEDGABLE]
What a beautiful ship!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! You're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- I never had much, but what I did have -- I lost.
Oh! I'm sorry...
I'm glad you found what you were looking for.
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
You can't go back to find your home. Your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
This is who you were. Exactly who you are is up to you.
Get to the point sometime tonight.. I'm late for a wenching.
Hey, she's just a kid. And she's going to Paris outta sight, outta mind, outta Russia.
I'm getting a chest cold..
So where will you go?
No. Empress, you --
You are the boy ...
That last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. You were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  Please, is there nothing I can do to repay you?
And tell me that she's happy.
I had nothing to do with it!
Then, you'll take her to see Tatiana?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
You don't want my autograph.
What?
Well, you take a meeting with him, I'll take a meeting with you if you'll take a meeting with Freddy.
It's okay.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
The alarm clock.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
You? You kiddin'?  If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Oooh! Here! Here!
Talk to him. You speak shellfish!  Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Don't be funny.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
You sure?
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
Yeah.
What?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Oh, all right.
Good? I was-
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
big subject with me, yeah.
M'hm.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
I have a tiny apartment.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Really?
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass  because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
M'hm.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Who cares? Who cares?
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
M'm.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
Will it change your wife?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Oh, yeah, really?  Really?  How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Yeah?
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, I had the radio on.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know?  Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
yes, we had, uh...
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
Yeah.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
What'd I do?
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
Oh, you got a headache!
I have a headache.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
Charlie Chaplin.
May I see your license, please?
Don't give me your life story  just pick up the license.
You're crazy!
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Oh, Jesus.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
The one with the V.P.L.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
I'll have the usual trouble with Annie in bed tonight. Whatta I need this?
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
Now, don't let it be so long, now.
You think so? Do you really?
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Oh, gosh.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
I was a great beauty.
So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
Oh yes.
Absolutely not.
Leo?
I have a small window of time.
Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy.
I'm not.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  You know it could be disaster.  He's so allergic.  It's terrifying.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Don't you miss it?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
He's gonna miss his flight.
It's not a contest.
I'm the hired help.
Fuck you.
I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million.
So?
Excuse me?
Ya Vhol.  What are you, a fucking Nazi?
Go.
Hey.  Thanks, buddy.
Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing.
What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city.
Just do what I say, alright?
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
What did you get me?
I mean, you're really back.
Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come...
I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really.
Dolphins.  Great.
What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here.
That is not true.
Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway.
Don't push me away.
What?!  You aborted our child?!
I wasn't part of that picture at all, was I?  I wasn't part of that decision.  Did I occur to you at all?  It's a fucking farce.  It's a fucking farce.  How long did you think you could keep it going. You're amazing.  Do you have any idea what you've done to us?
Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now?
Me too.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
And I you.
I meant Sally.
In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing.
Oh.
Elitism?
Easy tiger.
Scout's honor.
Eight years, though.  That's quite an accomplishment.
That's very nice.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair.  But the moment was exactly the same.  The same, you know, dynamic.  And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh?
How's he doing?
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Sally?
Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
Set to the poem of Yetveshenko!
How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Very.
Panes is here!
Fuck you, Panes.
You see, that's worse.
Like the last time.
"We can't stand seeing you like this, Panes.  I hate you being alone.  Why don't you stay with us for a while?" "I'd love to, thanks."
It's our anniversary, Panes.
"Otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
No.  Not something new.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
We're going to have to go back out there.
Oh my God, sorry.  I'm interrupting.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
She's such a great photographer.
Sorry Azteca.  Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt!  Alley oop!  Shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  Boy am I hungry.  I'm so hungry I'm seeing double.  It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  When's lunch?  Tomorrow, or the day after?
He's...he's dead.  You don't have to look for him anymore.  He was eaten by a praying mantis.
I'm Princess Bala.
Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
I've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
Ha!  Don't make me laugh.  You're crazy about me!  That's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
Princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
The Club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  I want to try someplace different.
Who is that idiot?
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life!
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
Well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
What's this?  A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
You have to help me.  Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
I can't think of any.
You're a real buddy.
What do I do?
Yeah, but I hate drowning more!  Now <u>dig</u>!
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
So I see.
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
How come?
How many of those drinks did you have?
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Here. How about some breakfast?
Who?
I mean -- her apartment.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
Yeah -- I know what you mean.  Queen.
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
You really think so?
Why not?
I don't want to talk to him.
A what?
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
So who did you think it was -- Kris Kringle? What was going on here last night?
What for?
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Oh, you don't have to worry --
To me?
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
No I didn't.
Okay, get your clothes on. I got the cab downstairs.
You?
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby.  You still owe me for the last two bottles --
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Quite an office -- name on the door -- rug on the floor -- the whole schmear.
Sometimes,  there's a twi-night double-header.  A nebbish like you!
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
Something like that.
Any of that coffee left?
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
Say, this is Snugsville.
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
Who?
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
Do you know who this is?  Look at him.
What's with you, Fran -- did you forget where you live?
That's right.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
I wasn't trying.
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
Stop that, Fran.
Coming?
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Stay with it, Buddy-boy!  Come on, Sylvia.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Yeah.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Dreadful.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Delta ?
Thirty -- sometimes fifty.
I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel --
No shit.
Probably is.
There's some bad holes, man, and the cracks -- water's coming through the cracks. Food's shot to hell.
Elevate Lance, in the tree. No, I saw another.
I met the P.B.R. crew; they were pretty much all kids, except for Phillips, the Chief -- Gunner's Mate Third Class L. Johnson -- Lance Johnson; Gunner's Mate Third Class J. Hicks -- The Chef -- Radio Operator Second Class T. Miller; they called him Mr. Clean.
Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge.
If you're B.L. Willard, 4th Recon Group, we'd like you to come with us.
Touchy.
Terminate ?
Do me a favor buddy, please.
Captain B.L. Willard, G-4 Headquarters, reporting as ordered, sir.
But we civilized it. A place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.
What?
The wind --
It's still pretty hairy, sir.
Hell's Angels Four to Big Duke Six -- we'll need green smoke -- suggest you have the FAC mark it.
This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left.
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I met him.
And I don't intend to get some of them chewed up just to get your tub put in the mouth of the goddman Nung River. You say you don't know Kurtz?
Music?
I'm Kurtz.
We were attacked -- down river. We need supplies and medical help.
How's yours?
Oh Captain, that is so true.
You knew him best.
Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater.
Now I can get out a here -- if I can find a way out.
This boat's a mess.
Who are you?
I just follow my footsteps, one at a time, trying to answer the little questions and staying away from the big ones.
Relax.  I got a nervous man here with a magnum up my nose.
48   CONTINUED:
Let's go.
113  CONTINUED:
A certain sonofabitch bastard -more-
Had?
I have not, but I very much want to.  What do you know about the trouble in Devil's Cauldron?
I'll go into town with you.
Here.  A transport plane is due at eleven.  Once I put him on it, it's all over.
You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
Ben Corbett?
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
I needed a pilot's license to take the job here, so I got one in six weeks.
Still quite a hike to Devil's Cauldron.  Days.  A long stretch to go without sleep, my friend.  You can hide behind that pistol for now, but take your eyes off me long enough to sneeze --
Forget it.  It would take days.
Damn lucky this storm didn't blow down when we were on those baldheaded mountains.  It continues, we better stay put.
How many do you see?
Don't push me..!
Talk to that good-looking girl of yours?
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
-- Here?!  Where's Wilder?
What's wrong?
Look, Mr. Desmond, I didn't count on it turning this ugly.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
Thought that door was open last night...
You hear me?  Ben?
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Uh, Udall?
I'm not kidding.
So you'll be at work?
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
The stiff one eye?
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
I was going to do that for you.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Stop asking everyone.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't.
That seems like a good choice.
The two might go together.
Were you asleep?
Because...
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
Was this supposed to be your room?
Good night.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
If you want to see me you will not do this. You will make an appointment...
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
How's Verdell doing?
It's been five weeks...  another few won't kill me.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Yes, we do... And I can give you a tie and jacket.
No. Please, don't force him.
Frank's idea. He thought I should have notes so I did this right... maintained focus, didn't get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
Frank loves you. You know that... but I've spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
Absolutely.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there!  Have you seen Verdell?
No, I didn't.
Thank you. Verdell...  sweetheart?  By the way, thanks for saving me.
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
The fact that you haven't said, "hold it" means I haven't done it right...  is that correct? I haven't done it right?
Why are you doing this?
So you're from around here?
Where you from?
What are you doing?
Tachlinkov.
We go around once.
I knew the same way in ten years you're going to know.
What?
Why don't you tell me.
I'm on the scent.
Why?
What I'm trying to say is that -- I'm not sure I can do this, help you, unless I know more about you.
It looks like white's game.
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Jesus -- why?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
They didn't give you a choice, did they?
They are very good at what they do. It's very seductive.  The training, the weapons, the travel --
The same reason everyone does.  You hear your name on C-SPAN and you realize you're a skeleton in someone's closet and they're coming to bury you.
Then you went freelance?
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
It.  Tell it.  For all I know it could be a machine.
Good.
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
He won't be looking for you.  Just be careful.  Buy a book.  Keep your sunglasses on.
You should knock.
I'll be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  You'll have the gun and I'll drive the car.
Ten years ago.
What happened?
How do you know they're not?
I went into their room this afternoon.
Isn't it interesting though?  I mean, look at us, in this room.  Or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  I mean, we look like just another couple.  But what are we?  Doesn't it seem so crazy?
Honestly?
That doesn't sound normal.
I'm taking off my mike.
Okay.
For what?
Then, I'll sail alone.
How much farther?
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
Sure.
You're pretty famous aren't you?
It's a common question.
Don't know.  That's how it works.
I thought that I would be thinking about Margaret, or work, or that I'd be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I'm not.  I'm trying to think really profound thoughts, but I can't. It seems very funny to me.
Can I ask you a question?
This will take some time.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Just two things. What do I use to shift the stuff and where in hell am I gonna put it all?
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
I'll settle for a pardon. You gotta drill?
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
What's that, five instead of ten years jail.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
So why didn't we?
Fancy some lunch after we_re through with this Meccano shit?
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
It just happened.
What are you on about?
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
You capitalist pig!
Does Jahn's thing have a name?
I don't want to ruin your day.
So I hear.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
What about me?
I can't go with him.
I made a deal with Josh.
That one?
Jesus Holly, we got enough time.
Your home address is 18 Thornton Avenue, Coventry.
That's my mum's.
No!
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
But I don't want to go, I am enjoying it.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No, it's not true, you're lying.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
You mean it's started?
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
That's right.
You will wish you hadn't.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
A kind of freedom.
What is it you want?
And the students?
Would you like your things now?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
I decided to help out at the Asylum.
I think we should be going honey.
Yes, if you can get him free.
The University cannot do this. Is the room safe?
I'm sorry about how we --
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
-- This your idea of small talk?
Can't you have a normal conversation?
This play -- ?
What the -- ?!
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
The world of the dead?
In ten words or less?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
He okay?
You were great the other night.
It's not.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
And why would that scare me?
It's only 7:30.
Assholes. This happen to you?
So what do you want to see?
Can you locate XXI5639I?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
Pull over.
Jamie --
What are you thinking?
I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman.
Boys like him have -- expectations.
I'm not tired.
You know about this stuff?
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
For Jefferson High. For books.
Uh, yes, sir...
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
Huh?
Now, George! Dinner's ready now!
By the way, that reminds me...  Saturday night we're taking Grandma Stella out for Chinese food.
Learn anything?
The sunrise? What for?
How many times do I have to explain it to you?... We know you're not a fighter. You know it, I know it... but she doesn't know it. That's why we gotta make you look like a fighter, somebody who'll stand up for her, somebody who isn't chicken. And you're not gonna look like a fighter if you can't hit me in the stomach.
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
You mean, you're gonna --
What, am I radioactive or something?
Okay, Martin. You have a good evening now.
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
Eight thirty.
AM or PM?
Oh, right, right... 
Catch you later! 
A mall?
4200 rads...  That certainly can't be generated under controlled conditions in this day and age.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
I don't recall ever seeing it before.
Your 'mother' wanted me to tell you that she was very impressed by what you did this afternoon, and that if you were interested in going to the dance Saturday, she's available.
Look. I'm a little worried about this -- this whole thing with my mother, he admitted to the Professor. I mean, I don't know if I can do it -- I mean, hitting on my own mother, that's pretty heavy.
That's exactly what I said! I mean, a guy and his mother -- that's illegal, isn't it?
What year is this?
You see, I never rebuilt the time machine after it was destroyed in 1952. I decided that experimenting with time and possibly changing history was too risky. Anyway, experiments in time travel were banned in all 87 states after the governor of Cuba caught Dr. Felstien fooling around in the Bermuda Triangle -- that was back in '64.
Pretty, isn't it?
Can you imagine your parents in bed together?
Gone?... Where?
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Catch!
Yeah, I guess.
Okay.
What do you feed him?
What kind of work do you think you would be qualified for?
We did it, Ray.
Thanks.
Hi.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Can I be honest?
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
There you go.
You're a redhead.
Yeah.
You said that once already... Too late now.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Positive?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Well, I'd like to leave a message, if that's okay.
Yes?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
New Jersey?
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Forgive the butterfingers, Buckaroo.  Casper Lindley, Knight of the Blue Shield, at your disposal.  And my son, Scooter.
Not me. No way.
See 'em?  They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
You're a welcome sight...
Hey, any lock can be picked.  So what's he up to?
They're arachtoids, Buckaroo, from Planet 10!
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled Orson Welles into covering it up!  And then they founded Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems and hid there for...
Just their side.  What're we gonna do with these people?  They're illegal aliens, the way I figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
Did you say..."Peggy"?
This song's for Peggy.  And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
I gotta go.  We're on borrowed time.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Doctor Lizardo. Wasn't he on TV once?
So where's Buckaroo?
Now twenty seconds downrange...Perfect Tommy, how on earth is Buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Audrey, listen, I need help. I know it's late and I shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me I wouldn't have if I could see any other alternative, but I – I'm sorry - listen, how are you – I'm sorry. You doing okay?
What do you mean so to speak?! Audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
If I close m'eyes I can almost smell the live oak.
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
How long you been up there, Fink?
...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink?
No son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. No, I'm usin' it to build somethin'.
He's a great writer –
A souse!
...What is it Barton? Are you okay?
Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
Can be. Not easy, but –
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
Sure you could!  And yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, I'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
Thanks, I'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. You married, Bart?
...What's the expression – me myself and I.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...Probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for Wallace Beery.
I hope these are your shoes.
Jesus, what a day I've had. Ever had one of those days?
You're leaving?
What do you mean?
...Jesus, Barton, what the hell is this?  What're we gonna do?
Hold on –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Hold on. I said hold on, so hold on.
Jesus... They can tell that...
...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey?
It's okay... It's okay...
You'll be back?
I apologize, Barton.
...I gotta tell you, Fink. It won't wash.
Rez. That'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. Checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. If you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. My name is Chet.
...Okay
Is this multiple choice?
What did... What did he –
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Big fuckin' deal.
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Second one of your friends to end up dead.
He teach you to do it?
Hell, I could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but I won't insult your intelligence. Well all right, first of all: This is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. They don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. Too much of it and they head for exits and I don't blame 'em. There's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, Fink. Look at "Hell Ten Feet Square".
We got a call from Berkeley P.D. There was a killing.  A professor. Icepick.  In his bed.  Multiple stab wounds.  1977.
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
No.
No?
Who?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
How long were you having sex with him?
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
Even though you were fucking him.
How's your new book?
Did you think it was so special?
No.
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
No.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever tie him up?
Before your time, pop.  Mid-sixties.  Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I don't know.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
Why not?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
I'm going with you.
He left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  That's the last time anybody saw him.
Gus -- go over to Berkeley. Harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  Andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. Carbon Beth on everything.  I want some psychological input on this Andrews and Harrigan go; Nick is left there with Gus.
I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
She killed him.
It was an accident.
On what basis?
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I'd take some of them out.  I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
That's good. At least they're interested.
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Do you still love her?
Piss painting?
I'd love to see some more of your work... Where's your studio?
Tom and Cynthia Kruger.
Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.
OK. One last thing. Is there any anger in you? Any anger in your work?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
Paint it out.
Get up. She won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
Hey – Willie Mays.
You're shattering all my myths.
Who's John Henry?
Check you later, man.
I guess it was a long time ago.
I guess you did.
Don't you think he's using you?
Is that the best quality you have?
I'll take the whole tin.
Come on.
Oh. I didn't know. I'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  You'll miss a great meal and I'll keep the scarf, anyway. What's your name?
Life doesn't... make... sense. This city's k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a star.
That one's for you.
A what?
You're selling and ending the culture. Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
It's vichyssoise, sir.
Mr. Wayne ... a reminder:  Tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious Mr. Shreck.  May we RSVP in the resoundingly negative?
I can't sleep either, lately.  A little link, between us.  But bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I'm dying to disturb it.  That could put a strain on our relationship.
I tried to grab you -- save you --
Admiring your handiwork?
Selina.  Hi.  Didn't mean to --
You almost sound enthusiastic.
You've got a dark side, Selina Kyle.
I, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
What happened?
I am the light of this city.  <u>And</u> I am its mean, twisted soul.  Does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
It does to me.
My blood?  I ... I gave at the office.
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
I have but one pet cause, today: Ban The Bat.
I oughta have you spayed!  You sent out all the signals!
She jumped.  She'd been depressed.
You buy this "blurry" business?
Actually this is all just a bad dream.  You're home in bed. Heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. Tragic irony or poetic justice? You tell me.
What, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
He didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
Selina?!  Selina ... Selina ...
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
Too late for what, dear child?
Don't tell me you're on his side. Again.
Attending to heroes?  No sir.  My Only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.
Their new computer sciences division.  How did you know?
I could have made it, you know.  I didn't need your help.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Keep it.
Alfred has supported me my whole life.  Now I'm going to pay him back. I'm going to liberate him from his dismal life of servitude.
Damn?  Damn is not good.
You were a great scientist once. Don't squander your genius on evil.
Mr. Freeze.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
I can't believe we were fighting over a  bad guy.
Me too.  Great stems, though.
I see you knew him.
Physical perfection, charm and wealth tossed over for a dowdy spinster. How do you explain your behavior?
You're not even listening to me.
You just called me Ivy.  Who's Ivy?
I got the diamond.  Quell problemo, Bruce?
But he's never said a word-
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Yes.  But Alfred's condition is less severe.  Freeze's research says he cured a case like Alfred's.  It just doesn't say how.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego.  What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
Give it up.  If you threw yourself-
I want us to be together.  But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf.  I need a sign.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
You're too late.  Say bye-bye birdie.
If I misinterpreted your interest in the lady, I humbly apologize--
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
He ran away?
Actually, he took the car.
Maybe they're right.
Which `they' might that be, sir?
There's one other thing. I feel..
I remember a bat. A monster. A demon. Chasing me.  Oh my God, Alfred.
Why's that?
Try a fireman. Less to take off.
No insights here, doc. Just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  Oops. Times up.
Look, I'm rock climbing Sunday. How about coming along?
Why do I feel like the other man, here?
Why do you do that?
I'm not-
The last entry read, Bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  Bruce insists. I made them go out. I made them take me to the movie. To that theater...  It was my fault. I killed them.
Where will you go? The circus is halfway to Metropolis by now.
I need to be part of this.
You can't-.
Paranoid? The psychotic?
_We_ sure are.
...You gonna kill me?
A-14.
B-12.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Take me. Let the boy go.
... Murderer...
How much do you weigh?
All right, I'll develop the photos. Anything I don't want is yours.
Quite a while. I took the scenic route.
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
Great.  Give me a grant.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
All street mimes should be executed.
I'm sorry I had to stand you up today. I'd like to make it up to you.
Ohhhh... You don't mean that.
We'll raid the Ace the moment we get a warrant.
Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
Boss! Jesus! They've --
I missed you, Lieutenant.
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
Let's beat it, man.  I don't like it up here.
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
You shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  You shouldn'ta --
And what happens if we say no?
Joker here. Can we talk?
All right, then. Here's the deal. Total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Rich.  Reclusive.  Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
I bet they like him for his big charity balls.
Oh.  Sorry.  I was thinking.
You are on drugs.
Yeah. Deja vu.
Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?!
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
And what did you say?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
Go ahead.
Meaning?
Everything's gonna be fine.
shhh...
Here, let me do that.
Two dollars please.
Oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
Ah, Mr Bean ...
And howls Alison?
And that's where you introduce me to the Governor.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
No!
And a car.
Honey, calm down now... it's okay...
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Nope.
What?
Uh, B...A...U... No, uh, V...
Uh... Hey baby. Are we like, doing it?
Me first.
This is it, Beavis. Huh huh. We're finally gonna score.
Damn, huh huh.
Huh huh huh. Hey Beavis. We're on a bus with chicks.
This sucks. It's all hot and stuff.
Hey Butt-Head, look. A jack. Heh heh.
Heh heh. Fire. Heh heh Aaaaeeehhhhg!!!
Yeah, and um, he used to hit me too.
Bunghole...
Um, uh, butt... um, hole. Butt-hole...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Beavis.
I hope to score big there myself. I'm mostly going to be doing the slots.
Does that say Xanax?
Talk ta me, Bork.
Well, I'll be a blue-nosed gopher.
She's holed up in a hotel room in Las Veags. Your flight leaves in a couple of hours. Now c'mon, I'll drive you to the airport.
You were a roadie for Motley Crue?
Really? That's where we're from.
She's ready.
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.
Adam, your Bozman Building is a beauty.
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I don't think we survived that crash.
Two hours.
That's how long you were gone.
Anything happen while I was away?
I don't like situations like this. I hate it when I'm not in control. So just tell me the basics.
I guess... if I'm going to be dead, I'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
Is this a punishment for something we did in life?  What can we do?
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
Of course I did.
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Maybe they'll leave now.  That snake was a pretty nasty customer.
You know, I've been thinking.  I could teach Lydia to sew.
Nobody else can.
We want to frighten you away.  So that you'll move out.
What is going on?
Wait for who?
All right.  Who are you?
Are you Juno, our case worker?
No.
What about Betelgeuse?
I hate you!  I can't trust anybody!
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
No, I mean they've gone. Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.
Where'd they go?
That's right.  They treat you like scum I bet?
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
W... What is it?

He's your cousin.
Lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  Charles, we need to call that awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  Can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
Stepmother.  She's out torturing the movers.
Dad.  Do you believe me?
Are they suffering?
<u>I know</u>... I read your book, <u>The</u> <u>Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf</u>.
Is there much more of this torture?
Oh, Delia, lighten up!
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
<u>Adam</u>!  <u>Adam</u>!
You were wrong, it did hurt.
An attorney?
There's no need for a claim, the garden is a healthy one.
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
I'll send Wilson up to take you for X-rays, Mr. Gardiner. Feel free to use the telephone, and please let me know if you have any discomfort.
Chauncey, there you are. What are you doing on that leg?
Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
... He's gone, Chauncey.
It's not good, Ben - I'm sure you can feel it.
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days.  ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Do you know Raphael?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
My name is Chance.
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
I like Ben very much... He reminds me of the Old Man...
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Yes. I liked Louise very much. She was his maid.
Oh, I like that very much.
... I'm...  ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey...  ... With us ...
Chauncey...
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Yes, Eve. Ben is very wise.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
... Are you sure you like it?
Do you need a doctor? I could call Robert...
... Mr. Gardiner, I wish to be quite candid - considering the gravity of your economic situation, shouldn't we, the diplomats, and you, the businessman - get together more often?
To exchange our thoughts - what does a Russian know about business? On the other hand, what does an American know about diplomacy?
Yes, I understand.
So you know your Krylov in Russian, do you? Mr. Gardiner, I must confess I had suspected as much all along - I know an educated man when I meet one!
Oh, good.
Ho! Ho! A dash of American humor! Vladimar Skrapinov!
Yes, Eve. That would be good.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
No, thank you. My house has been closed.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
It's a very pleasant room, Ben.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
A flower...
Watch? You mean just watch me? Doing it alone?
Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
What about money?
... Yes. You can take me.
... My suitcase.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
... Well, your anonymity will be a thing of the past from now on.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
I live here.
I have no need for a doctor or dentist. I have never been ill. I have never been allowed outside of this house, and, except for Joe, I have never had any visitors.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
But you won't sign, correct?
... Nothing.
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
I can certainly understand that...
Good night.
Yes, Mr. President, we attempted to contact Mr. Rand, but he was too ill to...
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
I just wondered if you had gone over my speech, Ben.
Take care of yourself, Ben.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
Say, aren't you that actor guy?
Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thousand times, thank you!
Morning.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Hi.
I want to try.
Now?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
What about Maxine?
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
My God!
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
My name is Schwartz.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I’m in love with somebody else.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Moving story.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
You married?
That's the usual?
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
You're evil, Maxine.
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Well that's perfect. My second choice. Ah, this is wonderful. Too good to be true! You see, I'm a sad man. Sad and fat and alone. Oh, I've tried all the diets, my friends. Lived for a year on nothing but imitation mayonnaise. Did it work? You be the judge. But Malkovich! King of New York! Man about town! Most eligible bachelor! Bon Vivant! The Schopenhauer of the 20th century! Thin man extraordinaire!
I suppose I could come to him in a dream. I don't know. That's the best I can think of right now.
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Yes, my dear?
Do you?
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But of course.
Oh, be still my heart.
But now we've lost access to Craig.
No, I didn't know that.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
I love you, Lotte.
We have to meet.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!  What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Come on in.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
I'm getting better all the time.
No! Please!  Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here.  It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Aye. Speak then if ye must.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
You saying nothing counts?
Not like He punished me.
I don't know. Maybe we should have moved.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
YES.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
You on your way home?
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
You grown.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
Ya think?
Be here. In case.
Extra?
He's sleeping in the church.
The church!
Aw, no, Ella.
I told him...Showed him the newspaper. About Sethe. Read it to him. He left that very day.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Don't talk to me, Mr. Sawyer. Don't say nothing to me this morning.
Fuck.
Where'd she been?
I know my rights.
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
The Gundersons.
Fuck, man!  That's terrible!
Hey man, don't you have something else you could put it in?
Yes, so we were informed.  However, we must of course transmit the remains to you in a receptacle.
Fuckin' A.
He peed on the Dude's rug--
Shut the fuck up, Donny!  V.I. Lenin! Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov!
Donny, shut the f--when do we play?
It's already posted.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Oh yeah, how'd it go?
Are you gonna split hairs?
Am I wrong?
Who's in pyjamas, Walter?
I pull over and kick your ass out, man!
Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?
Does the Pope shit in the woods?
In a sense, yes.  Elfranco, my robe. My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal.  Which bothers some men.  The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.  Vagina.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
Sex.  The physical act of love. Coitus.  Do you like it?
Well--sure, I could do that--
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
She most certainly was not!
Dieter Hauff?
Uh-huh.
I keep telling you, it's the Foundation's money.  Father doesn't have any.
Well...no, of course not--
So who--
What the fuck're you talking about? The carrier.  What's in the fucking carrier?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Hey Walter--
Huh.  I did not know that.  Well, it's water under the bridge.  And we do enter the next round-robin, am I wrong?
That's your answer to everything, Dude.  And let me point out--pacifism is not--look at our current situation with that camelfucker in Iraq-- pacifism is not something to hide behind.
Yeah, but he's a fucking pervert, Dude.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
I don't see any connection to Vietnam, Walter.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Thaaaat's right, Dude.  The weight. The ringer can't look empty.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Yes you're wrong.  This isn't a fucking game, Walter--
Easy, Dude.
Yeah.  So as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. And we keep the baksheesh.
There is no fucking hand-off, Walter! At a wooden bridge we throw the money out  of the car!
Huh?  The problem is--what do you mean what's the--there's no--we didn't-- they're gonna kill that poor woman--
Walter, what'm I gonna tell Lebowski?
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
Fine, Dude.  As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
No, I'm--
Yeah.
Yeah yeah, I know the fucking show Walter, so what?
Dude, please!. . .  Is this your homework, Larry?
Oh, for Christ's sake, Walter!
I understand.  That's why I picked up the phone.
I'm saying if he knows I'm a fuck- up, then why does he still leave me in charge of getting back his wife? Because he fucking doesn't want her back, man!  He's had enough!  He no longer digs her!  It's all a show! But then, why didn't he give a shit about his million bucks?  I mean, he knew we didn't hand off his briefcase, but he never asked for it back.
And you were divorced five fucking years ago.
Sure you'll see some tank battles. But fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.
Yeah.
What's mine is mine.
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
I'll say it again, all right?  You told Brandt.  He told me.  I know what happened. Yes?  Yes?
You don't go out and make a living dressed like that in the middle of a weekday.
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?
We know the briefcase was empty, man.  We know you kept the million bucks yourself.
Put me down, you son of a bitch!
This guy fucking walks.  I've never been more certain of anything in my life!
He's half yours, partner.
You've been training two years to take me out.  Here I am, the big, bad vampire hunter.  So do it.
What about Nomak?
Blade.  We've got six Reapers.  They're all dead.
Each day is a little life.
Anyone else make it?
You don't want to go there.
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Yes?
No.  This is a dangerous game, you're playing, Damaskinos.
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
The pimp-mobile?  Just made a few after market modifications.  Nitrous-oxide injection system, forged aluminum pistons and crankshaft, higher flowing fuel pump.
Pretty.
Maybe not. I did some checking, she's a hematologist. Knowledge like that might come in handy.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
You're wrong -- a few minutes more, and my transition will be complete. Even your sword won't be able to affect me then.
Is something wrong, my friend?
Hold out your hands.
And you honestly expect me to believe all this?
I can go to the police. I have blood samples back at the hospital. I can show them.
Looks like we hit pay-dirt. This place is crawling with them.  See the valets over there? They're vampires. So is the doorman.
How can you tell?
I've been better --
Is it bad?
I never imagined I'd be so happy to see the sun rise --  It's over, isn't it?
I was afraid that might happen.
Blade --
He killed them?
And now you're using Blade to exact your revenge?
You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
Where they found the backpacks and all the film a year later.
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
Your parents didn't have a <u>bigger</u> one?
Could we take this up later--like indoors, without half the world listening?
--now c'mon!
Then I'm going--
--like you hurt the baby--
--Christ, they find out I let you have it for the weekend--
You want a hand?
Beer and weed is what I've got.
--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.
This is a little nuts.
There, what? I didn't see anything.
And let it be known--before we even get to Burkittsville--it's gonna be an eighteen thousand times better movie--for half the cost--
I take it back--she <u>wasn't</u> an actor. She's a nutjob.
Nice tent.
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
No sense at all.  I'm a little stressed.
What're you, crazy??
Get <u>out</u> of here!
Get inside quick, they'll stop.
Too busy eating us?
Where's Domini?
You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
What the fuck--??
Yeah. Me too.
I'd strongly advise you to join us--
--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
--who?
What?
Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
Let's get inside.
You wanna keep it down, she's trying to sleep.
Chrissake: why <u>any</u> of this?
Oooh. Oooh.
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
Finally got her back to sleep.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
She's far from "fine."
Anna--
Yes! I need to speak to Sheriff Von Teer.
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
...Ray stole a shitload of money from Marty. Until both of 'em calm down I'm not getting involved.
Yeah.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Abby... you all right?
Why didn't you get into bed?
...Where is everything?
...So?
You won't have to. I'll explain what a palate is.
See, Wednesday's the special on RC Cola. I don't know if I explained about the TV option. If there's a TV in the room, you got to pay the option.
What's the matter?
Back where?
Am I fired? You wanna hit me? What?
I didn't say that.  Well?
Well what?
I want you to go fishing.
Ya catch any fish?
...What did you do with the bodies?
What's this?
You said the usual--
Red Label.
...I thought you were dead. Going home?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Will you tell Mom when she gets home from the hospital that I've gone to dinner at Sandy Williams' house?
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
Got it. Thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
What color is it?
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
No. not at all.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Alright, suit yourself.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey nothing.
Shit. You better tell me something.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
. I. uh.
What do you want to do?
Men are crazy. then they put their craziness into me. then it makes me crazy. then they aren't so crazy for awhile. then they put their craziness in me again.  . it's burning me. but I love you. I do, I do. Did you know that? Did you know that I love you?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell. it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Don?. Where is he?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue. blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yes.
There ya go.
Yeah I did. treasurer. Shouldn't you be studying or something.
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long . the police are watching.
I've gotta go in.
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I'd like to talk to you about something.
I'm here, aren't I?
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
There are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it's necessary to take a risk. I got to thinking. I'll bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Now, how are you going to do that?
Now. we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window .alright?
Yes and no. Did you recognize him?
So. what's next?
Yes. I do.
It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
Leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
. I wish you wouldn't do this.  It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
Look. it can wait till Sunday.
Okay. thanks.
What did you see?
What's with Mike?
He got a little jealous.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
You better not, Jeffrey.
Okay. okay.
That's what makes it so good. You wanta hear what I saw today?
You worry about me really?
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
It's okay.
Really. you want to dance with someone else?
Dorothy Vallens?
Probably not. no. Why?
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Can I use the car tonight?
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Yeah, I know.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
The word is that soon he is to be king of the middle empire.  He is doing multiple runs right now and using the island as a jump-off point.
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua.  Como lo va a matar con un picahielo.  Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
This is it for me.
Honey, your nose!
I know it's not the greatest.  It's commercial.
Man.  Fuck you guys.  I have this great idea and you guys have to be all skeptical.
Do you have any agreement or understanding whatsoever with the United States government in regards to your testimony?
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Excuse me?
I know what you want.  But, first of all, are you cops?
Goodness.
What did I tell you?
Look, I'm sorry about everything.  I feel like an idiot.  You were right.  I did fuck you.  And then Diego fucked me. Cut me out, too.
You?
George?  You better get yourself a good lawyer this time.  We're gonna nail your ass to the wall on this one.
I don't like a lot of conversation, Diego.
What kind of project?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Getting it here is no problem.  Trust me.  I'll fly it in myself if I have to. What about supply?  How much can we get?
How are we doing?
But you must.  It's the only way.
Please, continue.
Thirty-six hours.  I can't believe it. Everything is gone in thirty-six hours.
There's no room.
Are you comfortable with this?
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah, layaway.
Mexico.
Yes, Barbara.  She was very pretty.
I just can't get over the size of that ring.  I just love it.  Fred, look at it.  Tell me you don't love that ring.
Freedom.
Yeah, maybe.
Money.
I see.  I'm sorry about this, George. I'm not happy about this situation. It's bad.  You now know who your Brutus is.
May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face...
Yeah.  Listen.  I'm going to be going away for awhile.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Don't be stupid, George.  We've got him. We've got him dead to rights.  But like I said, this is top priority so we're handing out free passes on this one. And the first one's got your name on it. Cut your sentence in half, maybe more.
I don't know.  My name is George.
No, that's alright.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
What do you want?
Mirtha, what's going on?  Everything okay with Kristina?
Kristina's fine.
Well, here I am.  See?
Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry.  I'm going to make this right.  I've got a few things going on...
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
What is it?  A Disneyland thing?
It's alright, Dad.
I didn't mean to...
Not today, George.  Time to go back.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
I don't need a little.  I need a lot.
No shit, Kevin?
Second district ...
Third group.
I don't even know your name yet ...
You weren't able to. But what's important is that you tried.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
I don't do that kind of thing.
No ...
Good evening ... Can we pass?
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
All right. See you tomorrow, Corbiere.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
That proves that I was wrong. Evidently I credited you with an advantage greater than I should have.
We'll lower a basket from the window ...
You got something on the coke?
Take some time off.
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
That's what my report will read.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
What induced it?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to someone in Mr. Marsh's condition?
What did they argue about?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of Miss Lawson's.
Can you?
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Aren't they all?
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine.  I would like to play it now.
You've been following me?
Objection.  The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
A little after eleven.
No -- never.
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Yes -- he stopped smoking and drinking and exercised regularly.
Why did she say she was leaving?
What would she do that made it hard to resist?
She was.
Why?
Don't you see what she's doing?  She needs you to kill me.  She's planned it that way from the start.  That's why she phoned me tonight.
That's enough.
No.
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
October twenty-seventh.
He laughed -- and basically said he would decide when it was over.
What happened?
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
What changed?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Is it against the law?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
Hi, Frank.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
Sugar or honey?
He was only doing what he thought was right.
You're a monster.
Hello?
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
No -- he's lying.
I love you.
Michael -- get off the phone.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
Sharon, it's late.  Can we get to the point?
No.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
You think that's the answer?  Sex? Is that what you want?  You want me to make love to you?
That's too bad.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
It's not that long.
How bizarre!
Mom's orders.
Lawyer here?
Yeah.
What?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Bar across the street.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I'd kill him. Him and that Redfield woman. Together. First one then the other. And then I'd laugh.
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Well, nobody put a gun to his head.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
And how long are you here for?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
Then what happened?
You sound like an artist.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
What?
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Francesca?
What?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
No. But I love them just the same.
My mistake. I apologize.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
Oh, how is he?
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Sleep all right?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Stop it!
WHY?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
I don't know. Please...
No. Don't do this.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
What about his engagement to Dyan Cannon?
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
'Bout 4:30.
Franny?
What's she like?
It clearly states in the will --
Well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a Mrs. Lucy Delaney. Maybe you can ask her.
Yeah?
You didn't hear that?  "Take him... " Something.  "Bury him" or...
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
Boys and girls, Moms and Dads.  Children of all ages, I'd like you to meet... Jimmy Bones.
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Is this Hell?
Yeah, but I ain't talking horse.  I'm talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven. And the fools keep coming back for more.
My mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
But.
'Sup Jimmy B. Shotgun.  Get back on the curb!  Now!
Have you ever been inside?
Are they on the radio?
Careful.  That's bad luck.
That place is already bad luck.
No, I want to stay with you guys.  But I can't.  I mean I'm not ready.
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
No one'll ever come here.  Shut it down. Don't worry, the bank'll buy it back. I'll take care of it.
Sure, son.  I went down there and torched the place myself.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
Just a visit with my old pal, Jay-bird.
You certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  Nice lookin'.
Look, even if anyone found anything there, it's twenty years ago.  They could never connect it to us.
What it is?  What it will be, muthafucka.
I'm on my way home.  Can you handle it yourself?
Then how'd you hear it, fool?
He was a local legend back in the '70's. There was a song, Stagolee kinda deal: "This is the ballad of Jimmy Bones/Black as night and hard as stone..."
You gotta use your imagination.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
That's right, I know.  I fucking know.
You don't think I'll do it, do you?
The next one blows off your dick.
No!
I can't.  I can't.
Where the hell's the laundry detergent?
I hate that little fuck!  I hate him!  I hate him!  I should've done him!
But you know he did it.
No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back.
If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me.
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Don't tell him --
I had to.  You made me.
Try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes.  Thanks, though.
Another time.
No, Cease.  There was no answer.
Me?  Why?
It's Gino!  It's Gino!
We had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
See?  We're for real.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, look, forget it.  I shouldn't have called...
No.
They took over a club I was working at.  Caesar started managing it.
What's wrong?
Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you.
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
What you heard wasn't sex.
No.  Shelly knows what I am.  He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Yes.
I want out.  I want a new life.  I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
That's why I need your help.  You said you were good.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Like each other?  They hate each other.
Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
Has Caesar ever seen him?
He does it right in front of him.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
He'll have to run.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
okay, all right.
I'm still here.
No, Johnnie.  No goddamned phones. Not now.
Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
No.  Pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
Yes.
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
<u>What did you do to me</u>?
I know you've been trying to kill me.
Yes.
His brother.  You know his brother?
You swear?  That's great.  I feel so much better now.
I don't know.
-- which was okay for a while, I was okay with it...  But then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things I know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  I think something bad happened.
What are you talking about?
Okay, so...
He came to kill us.
You knew he was coming.
-- I don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane. 
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
Stop where you are.
xxxxxx
-- what do I? -- I put the name of the person I came to see? --
What?
What the fuck is he doing?
Abbott.  He knows about the embassy. He's coming down for a show and tell.
-- what're you talking about? --
You're American.  I thought so. From your teeth -- the dental work --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
...Be back.
Machines don't fix themselves.
He's tampered with it, Dowser.
Ah ha ... there you are, Sam.
What? How do you know my name?
Er ... Thanks ...
Aren't you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
Yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
Thank you very much, Deputy Minister.
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
You are late.
SAM! What a surprise!
OK. OK. Let's not fence around ... This is the situation. Some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, B58/732 and T47/215.
Christ! You do know it all!
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Get her out of circulation - I've put her on the detention list.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
But, I've already put her on the search and detain list.
Come off it, Jack! Of course you can check to see if she's been arrested.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
Tell that to the wives of the Security men she blew up this afternoon. Listen, we've also had a report just in from Central Services that Tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent Central Services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I'd keep my eyes open if I were you, Sam. Bye.
It could all be coincidental.
Jack, she's innocent!
How do you think I feel? You shit!
Is it stamped?
Where do I get it stamped?
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
Alright! Alright! Alright! I'm Information Retrieval Officer -  DZ/015, and I'm arresting you for - your own good! Now start up and get moving before I hand you back to them! 
Where are you taking me?
What?
OK. What's in the parcel?
Really.
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, all wars do -
Every day?
You're joking.
What?
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
But if they did promote you
We've got to get rid of it! There's been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they'll jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
Is it all right about Mrs Buttle's cheque?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
It's what you wanted isn't it?
What?
You remember Samuel, my son.
What have you done with his body?
Between you and me, Madam, today the number two.
Hello - Central Services - I'm at 579B Block l9, Northwestern Section D - that's exit 1 on Green Pastures Highway at the Orange Blossom Flyover - and I've got trouble with the air- conditioning
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
Put the phone down and your hands up.
But I could be anybody.
what? ... Oh ... 
My friends call me Harry. Information Retrieval, eh? Interesting!
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
She say she in great pain.
Is this what you gave Mary?
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Twelve Young, I don't have time for your games. Now answer me or do I have to come out there myself?
Okay, what happened?
Here, you try.
Sure, sure, give go.
What?
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
Yes.
Sleeping.
Be tough to get a taxi here. We can give you a ride if you like.
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
I need to sit down a minute.
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I think the worst is over.
I ever tell you about the time years ago I was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
I'm hungry too. We gotta get some food after this.
It's coming.  Hold her down.
What's that, Frank?
He coded. They shocked him one too many times. I'm sorry.
These are hard times, Tom.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, Tom, pick up a job.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
Mr. Oh.
You take things too seriously. Look at us, we're cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. We've got a good job here.
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
What did I do to you?
I'm not buying into any of that.  I have a load to learn.  I'm not going to act as if...
Okay.  Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
No.  No.
No?
What did they do with you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Yes.
Which would you prefer?
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now.  But he's not ever gonna change.  He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie.  He feels no different.  He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Sure.
Did you bring your grey suit?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Anyway.  I want you to think of this as...
Goodbye, Paul.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Bad manners.
Oh, please.  So they were really impressed with you at work.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
How's it going?
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
Yes.
No.  Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
Oh, good.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Maybe I haven't been here long enough.  But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
I knew what you meant.
How come you're not chasing it down yourself?
It's a...full length life-size figure!
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
Let's see it.
Where where...
I mean, you look so pretty.
Because...  We're just friends.  That's all. Just friends. WALTER I get it.  I see the whole thing now. No one knows if Walter Paisley is born!
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
I'm sorry about what I said before.
Forget it.
It was.
I've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  Well, what's your opinion, Leonard?
It will take years to make that many statues.  But your work would be featured.
It's our road kill series.  I take the pictures.
Man that's a trippy name, kinda like the Warhol mayhem series...
Man look at that get up !
Well I brought something, I wanted to show you.
Did you hear that Mr. De Santis? Everyone's really crazy about Dead Cat.
H-have a seat?
The question is what are you going to make next, Walter?  Did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  How about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
You better hold off on the bubbly.
Hello Leonard!  Beautiful morning, isn't it?
Whatsamatter Leonard?
Yes, you have.  Can I come in?
Who do think you're dealing with, huh?  I'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
I- don't know what you're talking about!
What are ya, deaf?  Turn around!
I know that - I know that! I also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
Maxwell.
I thought you didn't respect money!
I get it Walter.  I get it.
With Dead Cat.  Like a breath of fresh air.  I could just - babble on about it for hours.
That's really nice of you Mayolia.
Hello Walter.  I want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
What's got into that cat?  Well if you do see him, tell him I've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
Straightening up indeed!  Are you sure you're not alone?
I don't think this is gold.
I look horrible.
It's coffee.
You think?  Split?
Wheels?
He doesn't look fifty.
What show is this?
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Hey, baby, how ya doing?  You look beat.
I can't get sick.  You know -- training and all.  I'm gonna be late.
Buffy, what are you doing here?
Hi there.
You want some water or something?
You sure?
Yeah?
I'm going shopping.  Don't try to stop me.
That's me.
Are you okay?
Like what?
Let's meet tonight, okay?
Why?
You must believe me.  You must come with me while there's still time.
China.
Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
Meet me at this address after school.
There's a great deal I have to show you, I'm not even sure where to start  There's so little time.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
I still don't get how they happened to come to my town.  I mean, was I born here because... because they were coming here?  That Lothos guy, and his buddies?
Great.  First I have a birthright, now I've got a fate.  Hey, do I have to take notes on this?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Same one.
Fine.
You'll get used to it.  I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
Buffy...
There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born.  My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs.  There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger...  I'm sorry.  I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
I'm curious, is all.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
Vampires of the world, beware.
But it's in the back.  Why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
I'm pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  Come on, Merrick.  Football.  Afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
No THX.
Hi.
So very much.
What... are you?
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
I don't understand.
Got that.
Well, I hope so.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
Buffy!
If we don't invite all the seniors we can't use the school funds, you know that.
I really was way way too too.
Like you've got a grip.
And the January Semi-formal --
I am.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
That's my leg.
Fundamentals?
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me.  I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
He' s confused--
I want to be had.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
What's it say?
Hum, babe, hum, babe, fire it in here, hum babe--
Ninety-three miles an hour.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Ebby's told me a lot about you.
Yes.  A switch hitting witch. Very common in Puerto Rico.
Hey!  What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
I'm having a blast.  God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
You been in the Majors?
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
"Naw"?  There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
What's wrong?
Settle what?
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you.  Let's have a drink and forget this--
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
Nuke...tell me something.  Did you hit me with your right or your left?
No.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
Step outside, pal.
We fight, she gets the clown-- how's that happen?
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
We'll pray anyway.
It's a league record.
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers...
Liar.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that?
What do you propose?
Yeah, I don't want her in there more than a few more minutes.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Yeah, yeah. I know that.
M- Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Rothstein?
Hello.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
I'll call you right back.
Yeah, sure I do. Why?
Oh. Have a good day at school.
Hello? Hello! Ginger.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved.
What's that? You hear? You hear a little girl, Frankie? You hear a little girl, Ace? Is that a little fuckin' girl?!  What happened to the fuckin' tough guy?  Told my friend stick it up his fuckin' ass?! Huh?! Huh?!
...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim.
You mean, I have your permission?
I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there.  Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home.
Okay.
I'm just tellin' you. Don't say I didn't warn you.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is.
A fuckin' pink robe and a fuckin'...
Yeah.
That's right, yeah.
Why?
Where the fuck you get off talkin' to people about me behind my back? Goin' over my head?
I'm only on TV because I gotta be able to hang around the casino. You understand that. You know that. Come on.
Oh, sure. Now you want to blame your fuckin' license on me, is that it?
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker.
I just told you. She called me.
She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
No, I'm not okay.
Yeah, she's here.
Okay, thanks.  Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry.
Okay. You come by the house?
Because Nicky enjoyed being a gangster, and he didn't give a damn who knew it.
Hello.
You've got to stop her.
Well, sir, I was just...
L'chaim. [Yiddish for 'to life']
No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down.
Yeah, I know all that.
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
It's all right. That part of your life is over with. Right?
Right?
It's nice isn't it?
What do you need?
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
If not for me, at least for Amy.
I don't need one.
Uh,  I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
...under?
It's under...
He wanted a watch, too.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What did Jennifer have?
I mean, you tie up our kid and you lock the fuckin' door?  Are...
You fuckin' whore!
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Not gonna let me in?
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
...stunned commissioners into the hallway, where he continued his harangue until his own lawyers and friends urged him to leave.
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Four reels, sevens across, three fifteen-thousand-dollar jackpots? Do you have any idea what the odds are?
Three fuckin' jackpots in twenty minutes? Why didn't you pull the machines? Why didn't you call me?
The probability on one-four-reel machine is a million and a half to one. On three machines in a row, it's in the billions.  It cannot happen... would not happen, you fuckin' momo! What's the matter with you!  Didn't you see you were bein' set up on the second win?
I really think you're -
I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake.
Mm.
No, no? You didn't?
I didn't give 'em the m-
I don't want to go to Europe.
You know where she gets this from!
You need to understand, and I - I'm sure you do... that in a venture of this kind, you have to be prepared to take some kind of loss.
Yes.
Can I go in?
Go get a bag, man.
There's nothing we can do. She had the key.
You know who you're fuckin' with?! Huh? Do you?!
I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me.
He's not here?
Hey, Nicky, how are you? What are you doin' here?
Carmine left?
Artie!
For what?
How are you?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
It's in all the papers.
Frankie... the little guy, he wouldn't be fuckin' the Jew's wife, would he? Because if he is... it's a problem.
Because there's one thing about these old timers: They don't like any fuckin' around with the other guy's wives. It's bad for business.
Not like your fuckin' friends out there, that... without brains.  Okay?
Mm, you want to steal it? 
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more. 
I understand that. But, you know, I think you should try to make the best of it now. Go slow, you know. See what happens.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Yes, you are.
It's what you want?
I told you this was fuckin' dangerous. Remember I said, 'Ginger, this is a dangerous situation. Be very careful.' You fuckin' yessed me to death.
I'm not gonna kill him. Shut the fuck up. What, do you know what you're talkin' about? I'm not killing anyb-
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Get lost?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
Lester - he called you here.
You're done yakkin', okay? You're done yakkin' now?
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Get up.
What's takin' so long over there?
Give all the guys in your crew a piece of that?
Fine. Everything's goin' good.
You know what I want you to do? Get a couple of guys to dig a hole in the desert, then let 'em show you where it's at.
And when I'm ready, I'll say the words, 'Go see the Jew.'
No, no, no, no!
Fuck you!
Charlie M.
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
How you doin'?
Hey! Oh!
That's enough.
...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
Have we reached the epi-center?
I thought we were going to take it easy until the Mission...
You know, nobody likes you...
You say that like an amnesia victim.
What's the matter...
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I despise these kind of winds. Sorry, I guess I'm a little on edge. Seems this Catwoman has everyone, men and women, on edge. Don't you feel Catwoman says something about the duality of all men and women...
Oh now, you put up a good fight. Let's change the subject. Where do people who live in Oasisburg go to get away from it all?
Oh, how long have you had your own route?
You're right, I wasn't looking to fall in love with a casino worker. I'd given up trying to find anyone. But there was a fire in your eyes that cut right through the air conditioning and through the coldness of my heart.
I've been looking for you.
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Hey, speaking of Wrong Place, Wrong Time.  Lewis Lane to the rescue!
Boss, we better roll if we're going to hit this place, blow it up, and make that flight..
Catwomen. Lots of them!
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
The "skylight?" Fool!  It's too high for anybody to climb out the damn skylight...
Cactus, sometimes you don't deserve to wear our logo.
Cactus--shooting a man in the back is not very noble.
Sorry man, I didn't mean that personally...
You like them, don't you, Boss.
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
Hasn't anyone ever taught you that fighting violence with violence solves nothing.
Oh no, not a computer disc. A computer disc?  Oh man, come on, what do I look like?  I'm not a crime- fighter, I'm not a detective, what, I'm supposed to find some "clues" on this disc. I can't...
"Save the City?" I don't want to save the city, I want to move!  Listen, I'm sure the computer disc is pretty fascinating and I can't thank you enough for the little weird gold thingie, but..
Stop.
How much?
Next time, call...
Nothing. How's your hand?
I'm having a hard time picking up your signal this morning--What did you say?
You're late.
I'll take your abuse, but it's way too early for the sanctimonious Cult of Gag...
I don't know if I can do it alone.
I'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
Say something ...
We've already got an ambulance on the way.  Don't try to get out.
I got to get going.  An agent is showing me a house up on Broad Beach in ten minutes.
Lady, don't let him do it!
It took you long enough to get my ass out.
We have never worked a gig together but I am a firm believer in preparation.  So let's go over this again step by step.
Just hand up on the bitch!  Fuck you, madam.  And goodbye!
Nels?
Who smashed the phone?
I realize you don't want to be involved.
You won't disconnect.
Oh won't I?
Where'd they take you to?
Oh man.  These people mean business.
Forget who I am.  Where's this school located?
I kind of dropped them off.  They were getting on my nerves.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Hey drop it, okay?
It never healed.  I called her a lying bitch and everything else and I hung up on her.  "Click." You don't exist.
I sure as hell got my wish.  She doesn't exist.  So maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
Our house always needs touching up.
Pictures.
What's happening?
They'll recognize it's not your husband.
How come everybody turns out to be a crook?
It won't be him.
Why tell me this?
You can't give up.
Did you jiggle the phone?
No.
I'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  And I'm in a position to negotiate.  What about your husband and your child?
Lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  We're almost there.  Simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
Don't start thinking about it.  Is the tape off?
The guy with the transplant.
Absolutely.  And Topanga Canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if I recall.
I guess I ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
Plus names, addresses and I.D. for the lot of you.  We're in this together and I need to know who my partners are.  In case I ever need to roll over on somebody.
That's where this Chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  I could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
That's not good enough.
Took preparation.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Thank God -- thank God I've got you.
There are no guarantees in this life.
Be careful in disposing of them. You'll have to discount 'em. You'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
And they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
Intelligent question, Nels.  I believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
You could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
I'm in awe.
Hold on.
See what, Dil?
What would you call it?
Hi.
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
Everybody wants something.
He was different.
As different as it's possible to be.
No --
What would he think?
Depends what it is.
See, I was always best looking after someone. Must be something in the genes.
Do you care, Jimmy?
Made me feel all funny inside.
So I'm sorry.
Probably.
Kind of wish I didn't.
Come on.
What pills?
I got the order to shoot him. Before I could do it he ran. Ran into a tank and died.
In a manner of speaking.
Don't leave me tonight. Might kill me, too.
Love you, Dil.
What was that she called you, Jimmy?
Will I see you again?
I've got to keep you healthy, Jimmy. I'm counting the days. Two thousand three hundred and thirty-four left.
Do you now.
Poke him or something. See if he's still alive.
Tough work, that.
Leave us, Judie.
Leave me alone, Jude.
And what happens then?
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
What?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
And who is she?
This is a farce, man.
How did you know it was her?
What's that?
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
What makes you think that?
No.
Don't you think of it, fucker.
What the fuck am I doing here.
"Go back to your banana tree, nigger." No use telling them I came from Tottenham.
Best game in the world.
That game where a bunch of paddies whack sticks at each other?
Having a pint in the Rock.
We don't look on it like that.
I didn't.
Dil wasn't trouble. No trouble at all.
How can I?
And the scorpion. No. Tell me anything.
When I was a child...
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
You didn't?
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
You greenhorn -- you half-witted, thick-skulled, hare-brained, greenhorn! They wuz both too smart for us!
Oh!
What about it?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Adam --
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
With whom? Where?
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
Have some, please. I've got...  ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job! 
I believe you.
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
Me? Why me?
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
The envelope -- imagine that.  Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
It's Charles!
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
Then how do I know this is your office?
No.
My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to --  What happened?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
Maybe.
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie.  Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
Shut the door!
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
It's a start, anyway.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
What do you mean?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
In money.
And if it is?
I don't know anything.
He was American?
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed."  Not very much, is it?
Did you?
Oh, la.
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
I found it! I found it!
Oh, forgive me.  Is this yours?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
I'm not sure I --
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
How do you know?
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
Are you in the book?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
I don't know where to go.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
How do you shave in there?
What?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
Go on.
That's all.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Because I don't love him.
I never fucked Rod.
I get all your CDs.
Ok not your imports. All your other CDS and your K2 snowboard.
But I am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
It's almost ten o'clock.
Hi honey.
I'm fine. I've just never had someone my age die before. It's so weird.
I want you to head right home after school.
She was murdered?
I know where you're going.
We just found another body.
Ok. Should I put my bike in the back of your car?
Of course I'm scared.
Yes.
He says he loves me.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
FINE. Are you?
Ok.
I can't right now.
Twenty eight years ago.
Why?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I heard you got attacked.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
I feel like I NEED YOU DAD'S permission just to kiss you. Jody, it's time to assert yourself To be a big girl. An individual. I'm going to this party tonight. Jimmy's my ride. Come over to my house after school. We'll go together.
Just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Please don't go. Please. Stay, We'll just talk. Then go to the party.
Mom?
I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
She was raped. At least that's what she claimed.
No, I believed her. She was in pretty bad shape. Inside and out. But the boys were never formally charged.
Who?
THAT'S why he called Mr. Sisler first. He was one of them.
You ok?
Dylan's been telling people that Annette gave him a blow job.
Hi Mark, Cindy, Ben.
So are you.
Ok.
I said no.
Rod!


Shit!
...yeah.  Tryin' to get most of my day done before it hits nine-...
...-ty.
That's my business.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Why don't I--?
For cryin' out loud.
I need your help.
...truck.
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
What did you do that for?  It makes him mean as a snake.
No, no, no.
Yeah, borrowed!
 
...I'm not the psycho.
...-cho and a hijack-...
 Yeah...
I did not steal the truck.
...man!
Oh, shit.
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
...we can make it.
Eight and a half feet wide!  Weighs over five tons!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
...do we?
 I should've had that dog bite me.  I would've gotten rabies! Could've went to the hospital, had a pretty nurse!
Come on!
Left, left, left!
...Pete!  Come on.
...Pete.  Come on.
Come on...
Shit.  You gotta pass him. 
...ho!
 


 Okay.  Okay. 
Yeah...
...to him!  You don't know who...
You're--?  What?!

...piece of shit was worth.
We were nationally  ranked.
Split?  I wouldn't get ten...



They're movin'.
We're gonna die!
Put your hand in my pants.
 Okay.
 Okay.
We!
And Brynner's right on...
Okay...
What the hell?
Oh.
...-ta get outta here!
Got it?   Come on, darlin'.  I gotcha.
Who put the big hurt on...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
Yeah.
Be cool.  Be--
Well, that just about figures for today.
...take my sorry old truck.
Well, why don't they talk to the sage of Jerome here?!
Your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
Whoo-hoo-hoo!  Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Is it--?
...-lar.
Damn you, Long!  My people are out there! Your people are out there!
...I wish they would've let me say something...
No, go--
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Grateful?
Went away? 
All right.  After they put you away...
And let me guess.  You failed.
So far, ye-yes.
 Move.  This is already affecting our schedule.
And so Missoula's prodigal son returns.
Check the immediate area.
I wanna patch in from...
...here!
Get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
Mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
...-fall.
 But...
Jesus Chri--  We're on a very slippery slope here, Sam.  A covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...out here, captain.  Don't you think the guys deserve a break?
...and a rifle.  You, on the other hand...
Doc...
Contrary to what Dr. Long may have told you, this is neither...

...and unharmed, de-...
Where's Elvis?!
Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
Goddamn it, Ma-...
...it.
Oh.  Well, I have got to get to the dentist be-...
Be sure you feed Bosco.
Oh, caught a few, lost a few.
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...somehow. 
Uh, we both like to fish.
Rangers.
Hit it...
...tight!
Gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  Now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  Brynner's next move is gonna be to get Elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  To do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  That's where we intercept him.  That's where we make our play.  Now you and your men back off.

Deputy Art Lewis, Jerome County Sheriff's Department.
Mason?  No, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...-time. 
And I'm good at this.  Been doing it since I was a kid.  But you, I don't know.  Somehow you think...
...fishin'.
So reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
Mason.  Mason!
So, Mason, last Wednesday night, uh...were you out...
Nope.  Is there a prob-...
So you don't remember...
...hands!
Yeah, asshole.  I'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
 Listen, Pappas...
  All right.
I'll lead 'em out.

It's too late, Mason. I've...
Honest?
Mr. Gittes!  You're dealing with a disturbed woman who's lost her husband. I don't want her taken advantage of. Sit down.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yeah.
If Mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
No.
Hollis Mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... We were a lot closer than Evelyn realized.
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
I'd like you to look at something, Mr. Cross.
What is it?
What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
Call me Jake. How is everything?
I don't know...
I've been wanting to meet you.
Where did you get this material?
The apple core?
Thanks, Lou.
You've done well by yourself.
Yeah?
You accusing me of extortion?
I don't think I need a day or two. You're even dumber than you think I think you are. Not only that, I'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where I draw the line, Escobar.
What's the maid's address?
Do you know where she might be?
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
What are you having?
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Why?... What on earth for?  Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
How did you find out?
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
K... Cross.
No, not for that one.
Of course I'm sure.
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
We got it. We got it, baby.
...No. Why was it.
I know.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
Including the death of your husband?
I am not!
What about?
Yes.
What did you do that for?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
Stop it!  I'll make it easy. You were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. It was an accident, but his girl is a witness. You've had to pay her off. You don't have the stomach to harm her, but you've got the money to shut her up. Yes or no?
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Sophie... is Walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, Escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I'll tell you. Wait in the office for two hours. If you don't hear from me, you and Duffy meet me at 1712 Alameda.
No, Mr. Gittes. Just look in the obituary column of today's Times...
Perhaps if we could meet your father.
I'm sorry. We don't.
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
Yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
That's like saying they're in Arizona.
Hard working, have a wife and kids...
Jake, what're you doin' here?
That's a long fall.
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
Gittes?... Gittes?
No, really?
But...
This type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, Mrs. Mulwray. It takes time.
This?
No, no. She said not to call, her husband might answer.
Yeah. What's wrong with you guys? Think ahead. We find 'em, sue 'em. We'll make a killing.  We'll have dinner at Chasen's twice a week, we'll be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
She ran away?
That's for sure.
But you don't have any kids!!!
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
Hi. Why are you running?
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
You're still beautiful...
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
He sure did, Mr. Kane.
Mr. Kane -
Three cents.
All right, but I'll keep these figures, too, just in case.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"!  This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists -  Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
You and Leland and Mr. Kane - you were great friends back in the old days, I understand.
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
In case you'd like to know, Mr. Bernstein, he's at the Huntington Memorial Hospital on 180th Street.
Do you, Mr. Leland?
Certainly not.  So what's that got to do with it?  Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Ask them to sit down.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
I'm going to live right here.  As long as I have to.
I'm still hungry, Brad.  Let's go to Rector's and get something decent.  The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter.  Why haven't we?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
Yes - Mr. Kane.
Has he said when he'll finish?
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story.  You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
What's the matter with you?
Oh!
Who am I?  Well, let's see.  Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six -  I run a couple of newspapers.  How about you?
Half past eleven.
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to.  You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
I won't let you go.
You're making a bigger fool of yourself than I thought you would, Mr. Kane.  You're licked.  Why don't you -
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me.  However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
You see!  There hasn't been a true word -
Close the door, Raymond.
Yes, Mr. Kane.
No, I don't, Mr. Kane.
I mean I've got a job for you.
Good.
Why not?
What lesson?  Not to expose fraud when I see it?  Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property?  Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
First of all - 
I'm drunk.
That's all right.  What are you going to do about Emily?
I know you will.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
Maybe you could remember something that -
Was he in love?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Well, thanks a lot.
I'd say you're about nineteen, twenty, am I right?
Well, if it's already too late...
Randal Graves-scourge of the video renter.
Dick.
Hey Caitlin...  Break his heart again this time, and I'll kill you. Nothing personal.
Territoriality. He was mine first.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
Nobody! I swear!
When did you get back?
Is that what they teach you at that school of yours? Kind of, sort of? Everyone knows about this except me! Do you know how humiliating that is?
How do you know that?
The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
I can't believe this! I feel faint...
Wait a second? Who was working here today?
Was he alive when... Caitlin...
Excuse me?
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Did you tell Veronica?
I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.
Oh, my God.
You think things would be any different now?
What about Veronica?
The Emperor.
How do you mean?
Yeah.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
Why doesn't he just mix and match?
Let's hear it.
No.
Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call.
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
I heard you apologize. Why? You have every right in the world to be mad.
The fact that I'm right about your buckling?
See? There you go again.
You know what Sanford told me? 
No, you're not.
You've gotta watch the store. I have to go to this.
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
She meant nothing to you!
An embarrassing way to die.
I don't want to talk to you.
Why should I loan you my car?
And this is what you rented?
No way!
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out.
Maybe the Asian design major slipped her some opium?
You just fucked a total stranger?
This life?
That's all bullshit. You know what the real problem here is?
Fuck you.
Oh, like your life's any better?
It's the same thing with Veronica.
What don't you do?  Randal, sometimes it seems like the only reason you come to work is to make my life miserable.
Like ten after.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
I threw out the stuff that got broken. The floor looks clean.
Get the fuck outta here already.
Are you open?
Yeah?
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
No, she's getting married.
Noinch, noinch, noinch-smoking weed, smoking weed! Doing coke!  Drinking beers!  A pack of wraps, my good man. It's time to kick back, drink some beers, and smoke some weed!
With you? I don't think so.
How do you figure... HEY! You can't roll a joint in here!
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
You used to go out with her?
I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
Oh... Can I help you?
Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties.
All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
I hate this fucking place.
What? What is that?
How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
Do you think anyone can see us down here?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
I touched a nerve.
What the hell was that for?
Vegetable meaning paraplegic.
Shit! Why are we getting up?
Because I did only sleep with three guys! That doesn't mean I didn't just go with people.
All right! Shut up a second and I'll tell you! Jesus! I didn't freak like this when you told me how many girls you fucked.
I love you. Don't feel sick.
I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective.
And that made you feel better?
...it isn't there. Yes.
Would you let me explain...
Randal...?
No way.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Holy shit! She told you about that!  Buddy of mine worked there. Said he watched the whole thing. They used to film people at that hotel; nobody knew about it.
You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie?
I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall.
Twenty bucks.
Willam!
"It's a perfect day for a monster jump."  Hey man, can you like do me a favor?
Hey, let's get something straight. If I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
A monkey?
Go on, fetch.
Tucker?
Rescue One -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
You're gone now!  I don't climb with people I can't trust.  Why'd you come up, to prove something?
Can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
She's tough.
You can stop right there.
The winds are picking up.
After the funeral I just had to leave.
I can't blame anything on Hal. It was me.  I play it back in my mind everyday.
You couldn't.
Y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
A flare up...
I can't.  Not here.  If you want, I'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
You know where everything is...  I'm late for my shift.
Gabe!?
Call me sentimental.
Gabe!  Are you alright?
Gabe are you alright?
Never
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Crockett River is where the last of the money fell.
Forget it.  You're in no shape to climb alone. I stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so I owe you. C'mon, let's go.  Hurry up, time is money.
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
The "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
Where's the helicopter?
Travers, you're not running things.
Rescue One -- please be advised Ranger Walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
Go after her.
You're looking at him.
Man against nature, right Travers.
Is it set?
We've been working hard too. Takes glass.
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no more and wouldn't want to be.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
No. She's dead!
Thank you very much, sir.
Do you still feel suicidal?
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
What crime did you commit.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the middle of the night with my pain.
Surprise?
Keeping fit then?
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.
What about Basil? Where's my snake?
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
You are now in H.M. Prison Parkmoor and from this moment you will address all prison officers as sir! Name?
Yes, sir.
Yes sir.
C of E, sir.
Fair hair, sir.
Crabs?
No, sir.
Fine... fine.
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.
I hope so, Missus. She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Good. I'm glad
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live anyway, not in a stinking world like this.
Indeed.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental stage at this moment.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
One pair of trousers - blue pinstriped.
Enough is remembered though, little Alex. Dim and Georgie laugh. They drag Alex to a low water through.
How many to a cell?
Keep it.  Go wild.  Have a party.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
You never answered my question.  You like what you do?
Like you, I'm good at it.  But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
Annie...it's Max.
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
This your current address?
You still carrying passengers?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
Tell me Vincent.  Tell me what you think.
Federal?
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
...yeah, I'm still at Bellevue.  The John Doe didn't pan out, but you'll never guess who's lying up in the meat locker.
Not our call, Phil.
Quite an achievement...
Try?
Max?  Maaax.  Pick up, dipshit.
Uh, yeah?  Lenny?  It's me.
Yeah?  So?
You mean like benefits?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
I'm gonna roll him off the hood. Always lift with your legs...
I tried it.
The thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
What?
I should only kill people after I get to know 'em?  Six billion people on the planet, you're getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
Why?
Who's that?
Pull your head out of your ass.  Get your thinking straight.  You wanna die?
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Don't be.  I never saw him after I was 15.  Went into the military early.  So all this talk about "my job's temporary, I got big plans," it's all bullshit.
I've always been good.  Ever since I started.  Gave up piano.  Easy money. I'm putting a stake together, get something started.  Go figure it all out...
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
What, no insurance?
I don't get it.
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
I shoulda saved him 'cause he <u>believed</u> you?
Head towards Union Station.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
You're too good.  We're in this together.  Fates intertwined.  Cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
They said send you downstairs.
Geronimo?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
She must be some girl.
Flip.  You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here.  Tell me something.  You think I'm crazy?
I don't see the connection.
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
I can't promise you anything.
You think I'm crazy.
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy <u>against yourself</u>.  I can't lie to me, Liza.  And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on?  You want to go out sometime?
What is?
You switched the charts; you tell me.
What took so long?  You were in there all day.
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
You're certifiable.
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
Never heard of him.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
Not this again.
Johnny Dancer, right?  You don't ride him anymore, do you?  Not since your dad died.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind.  You'd think I was making it up.
Realized what?
Murdered?
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore?  If I was normal.
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
I don't know what it was.  All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it.  If that's love, it's not so bad.  I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Walters was their fall guy.  Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear.  Don't you see?  Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison.  He was looking into getting him out.  He didn't believe the official story.
You think it's a conspiracy?
I love you, too.
You're welcome.  Where's my partner?
You're here because you figured I might show up.
You've asked me that one three times.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
The truth shall make you free.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed.  How's Jerry feeling this morning?
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
You do recognize it then?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
Agent Lowry.
He's why I watch Jerry.  Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Where do you think Jerry is?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
Pull the plug.  Get her out of there.
There's no plug to pull.
Yes, sir.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Now I remember why I went into theoretical work.  Kent.
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
I'm willing to take that risk.
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
What?  Why?
I want you to listen to me, carefully.  The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
David --
You...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
I'll come right to the point, Doctor.  Your sending this message all over the world may well be a breach of National Security.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Could we hear to China?
Oh, we didn't build it.  The transit system has been in place for billions of years; we're just its... caretakers.
The scale... it's just...  So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
No more stalling, Captain.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
A page-break signal.  A period.
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But.  If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
Hokkaido Island.
Very well.  Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions.  Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us.  You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
What if I said I could get Drumlin to agree to sell you time in New Mexico?
This is a chance to be of enormous help to other people's research -- to have the power to be a real advocate where David's got blind spots --
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
It's too... elegant.  The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
Ellie --
So.  The final countdown.
What?
What are my other options?  In fifty years?  Never?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand?  I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point.  It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
... as have all attempts at internal analysis.  We've tried sonargrams, magnetic resonance, gamma rays; it's completely impenetrable.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
Nothin'. Ever'thing's cool's can be.
No.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
Yeah.
What's all this dirt in the yard?
It ain't my fault you don't know how to handle your dogs.
Maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. What was that?
Borrowin'.
You gotta mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
Pair'a nines.
Uh-huh. And he ain't got nothing showing. Raise his head off.
But there's still daylight left.
Oh lookit that brunette.
Dragline, lemme look at the picture.
Slow down, man. They ain't passing out medals for slinging dirt.
Hey, buddy. Take it easy. You're making me look bad.
Look at Him go. Bam! Bam!
Like I always do?
Thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
A bunch. Must be halfa dozen Newmeat.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Ace calls. Here we go.  King-five gets a tray for no help.  Paira ninas gets a Jack.  Ana man with the ace gets... slop in the face... Ninas up.
Oh no, man! Not on this hot muther.
Where were you?  Don't tell me. It's just under seventy, right?  The sun is strong but the air is dry and fresh...
I've told you:  I can't afford to garage it.
A little heavy breathing is what most of us yearn for.  <u>Forget</u> it.
I can't, Andy.
None of you know anything about it. Now go.  And Andy, if you persist in playing doctor, leave, with them.
Oh, God, I forget.  Yes.  Yes.  You go.  Poor thing, you ought to get out.
Sorry, Luv.  I've got a date.
She just got to sleep.  Do you have to tell her about it now?
You get me out first.
What Friday?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
We know...  Send the book to evidence...
Hello, Daryll Lee.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
Hi.  It's your worst student, Peter Foley -- how do you grade me now, Doctor?
You like that action?  Didn't that cop on TV look <u>solemn</u>?  The guy in the basement doesn't matter, anyway, just another lonely heart.
Mm-hmm.  I can't get to you.  You have to come to me.
I need her; she's a cop.  I have to kill a cop, and then...
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
I think this is number three...
You don't admire me.  No police admire me.  I got one of you killed.  Why don't you say right out what you're here for?
Oh, my God, no!  I'm a clinical hysteric, with panic syndrome, and anxiety neurosis, agoraphobic, I'm afraid of everything, real and imaginary.  I never leave this apartment now.  Nobody ever comes here.  I just wanted to get your attention.  I write and I used to lecture on these crimes, but... I'm not competent.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
He's going home.  He slept over because I was a little anxious...
That's no surprise.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
This one, yes.  I was always curious about these twisted little souls, but this is the first one I've felt personally terrified of. He's something new and unheard of. I don't know what he wants.
Why should I trust you?
Helen, hang up, let Ruben get on with his work...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
It's a game they like to play. Berkowitz -- "Son of Sam" -- hung around the crime scene, talking to the cops.  This one's probably watching <u>you</u>, laughing at you.
You and MaryJane aren't lovers.
She takes tranquilizers her doctor prescribes.
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
If this is just the dump site, where did he do the job?  Where did he pick her up?
Sure.  She likes <u>you</u>, Rube.  She likes the way you move.  She sure as hell isn't in love with me.
Is Niccoletti <u>assigned</u> here?
Ruben, my God, I ought to put you on report.
She wants me to check the phone booth for a note.
You messed with the scene.
Sergeant?
So what have we got?
Give me Ruben back...
...confirm this third murder adds up to a pattern?  Do we have a serial killer on the loose in the city?
She knows I'm Catholic!  She never mentioned divorce!  Not once!
Not a lot of action here.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
You should have gone to the funeral.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
He's very pale. Covered with scars.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
The traffic... where is everyone? They've all gone away.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital.  I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
The airport? Why? Are you leaving?
No.
A complimentary ticket for a special stunt-driving exhibition. Definitely not part of the big auto show. There's a map in the packet and a note requesting you be discrete about the location.
You're kidding.
What exactly is your project, Vaughan? ~ book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic?
It's the future, Ballard, and you're already part of it. For the first time, a benevolent psychopathology beckons towards us. For example, the car crash is a fertilizing rather than a destructive event - a liberation of sexual energy that mediates the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity impossible in any other form. To fully understand that, and to live that... that is my project.
Do we have to talk about this?
What about Michael? Do you know the extent of his...
OK, good. That's good. Thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
Please, Letty.
Everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
Letty, dinner's almost ready.   The souffle...
Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
Ecru.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
And my class. It'll be hard to find a good substitute. And what about my math program?
You too, Mom.
I'm so thankful you'll be leaving next week. If you want me to pick you up, I will.
I don't know why you feel you have to lie, Letty.
I don't mean to go on and on like this.
It's no big deal.   We all compare.
What are you looking to read?
The lady knows this is a dandelion.
I had to sneak by the guards to get here. They say you're highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
I do.
Michael, I...
Tell me all.
I love the pillows.
It's TV heaven.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Hey.
I'm supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
Sounds grim.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
I guess so.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
But that wasn't me.    I didn't mean to do that.
It's not another one. It's my sister.  Aren't you happy for her?
Can I put these here for tonight?
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
What are you doing?    You're going to be late.
It doesn't matter who.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
Shhh. They're coming to the cubic zirconium.
What are you doing?
Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
It's me...
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
You've already robbed the safe?
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
I'm good.   Really.
Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
Half the tapes.
Thank you.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
He said to go fuck yourself.
Bring me the scissors.
Turn on the flashlight.
The deal is whatever Mr. Bastaldi says it is.
Do I?
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
After the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
They'll be waiting for us at the airport.
It's not your fault, Daniel.
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
What?
Does it really matter what I say?
I will.
Man, I can get anything.
I just thought that--
There has to be.
What do we do?
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
This is bad. This is really fuckin' bad. Am I the only one who sees how bad this is?
Maybe I'm missing the obvious, but why aren't we leaving town? Any place has to be safer for us than Chicago.
What the hell is he talking about?
No.   How much?
No.   It's mine.
The hell it is.
I understand. The person who sent me wishes to help you.
You ask a lot of questions.
I don't remember.    I was drunk.
No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
What's this?
Oh really? Thanks. I thought it was a sewing machine. What the hell is it doing here?
I don't care about your sword.
Stop talking like a monk!  Just fight!
On guard!
I'm just playing around.
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
This spells trouble.
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
You're not married, are you?
No!  You couldn't roam around freely if you were.
You're doing calligraphy?
Do you think so?  Let me tell you a story.
No, really?
Don't distance us.  From now on, let's be like sisters.
You know about Lo?
Don't touch it!  That's Li Mu Bai's sword.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
You've got quite a temper.  It's better this way.
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
Your father's men are still looking for you.  They're still out there, circling closer.
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
It has.  How's business?
Yes.
Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
Come with me to Peking.  You can give the sword to Sir Te yourself. It'll be just like old times.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
It was Bo, Sir Te's man.  I hear he followed the thief to the Yus'.
My job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  I wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.
We're close to your headquarters. Go home and check in.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
Mu Bai, hold on.  Give me some hope...
I'm sorry she's not feeling well enough to receive you today.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
Maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
You're mistaken.  We're just street performers.  We were rehearsing.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
Please do not be such a stranger. You'll stay the night as my guest. Now, Shu Lien... tell me something. And forgive me for prying.  Your father was a great friend to me, and I think of you as my own daughter.
This is a delicate matter.
No onions though, okay?
Well, hello there...chocolate,
You don't say.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened.
Yeah, among others.  Hey, man -- you're hit.
It's just the dope, don't worry
My mom works over there.  I'm waiting for her, but she's probably with him, right now.
Does she have a name?
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
I don't know if I can.  But you have this... and you know where to come.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face!
You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away.  I don't have any power for you to take.
Like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.
No shooting.
I don't think so.
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
Thank you.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You didn't show it to anybody?
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
I sincerely doubt it.
You implied it.
Thank you.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Who?
Doing what?
Okay?
Of Human Bondage.
I do.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
Why aren't you understanding?
German.
What do you mean?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
I'll see you tomorrow.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
No.
Okay.
You'd do that for me?
If that's what you call it.
But I thought high school is only four years.
You think he'll like it?
I'm taking a shower.
Same time next week?
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
Yes!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Ronald?
What do you mean?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
He doesn't scare me. I'll kick his ass in.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
I see your point... though why should I care?
What's wrong with you?
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
Shut up.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Excuse me?
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
Get off me!
And if I don't?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Annette! Annette!
Right after we played backgammon.
We played backgammon?
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
I didn't know Mr. Reed had been married before.
What are saying, darling?
Sometimes.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
What's her name?
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
I'm never unfair.
You're shouting at me.
It's your play.
Where did you get it?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
But...
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
But there's no one here, darling.
Daddy?
What'd you get for Christmas?
But where do you come from?
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong — warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
May I pet the deer?
Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
Who is she?
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I'll quit someday. Doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
Wow your body's really hot.
A bite... Where'd you get bitten?
I mean where on your body?
How's the rest of your health?
It's hard to describe. I get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
How have you been feeling?
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
I get a little bloated sometimes.
Gross, so this is Mark's flesh? When did you see him?
Well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
What did he say?
Bag means condom now? I can't keep up with the word "bag." It used to be "No, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. But now "my bag" means "my fault."
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have than you!
Maybe the blood was from your period like before.
Frida, Carlton's dead.
DON'T call the police.
Let's do some research. I'll check the libraries. You surf the web.
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
The weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
We were -- I was just so tempted... It was sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
I'm not really hungry after all.
You're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
What, you got a date or somethin'?
You do though. You look really... is that a wonderbra?
OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do with my back like this?
Frida? I hear you talking. I know you're in there. Let me in.
My bra is my biggest supporter.
Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was talking about?
No?
I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
My mom used to get PMS too.
You know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? Well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
No, why?
What's with the squirt guns?
They do? Oh no...
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
I don't think you would. No matter what form you take.
What about... those guys... I might have...
Cause I'm a fucking werewolf!!
We can get a warrant if you like.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
So I asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. It's like the "bagger" system. You know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger...
Come on, I've been working with Frida. Carlton won't even recognize her now. She's really coming out of her shell.
You want her sheets?
I didn't trust her. All that blood on the sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. Something's weird.
Seems he's stolen money from them. He's desperate and our only lead.
You think mafia hit?
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
Did we get those DNA tests back?
Thanks.  Just some pills.
Not really...
Jesus.  Small world.  Where's the photographer?
Itís extremely important to my investigation...
Iím your new assistant.
How can I submit this?
Won't say.  Says he must talk to you.
Go on.
What?  Who has?
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
Yes.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
You remember nothing?  Who you are? What you've done?
Can I get my life back?
What are you doing?
No, it's the truth.
Not that again...
Please!  Don't be foolish!  Time is short.  Let me show you something. Look at this syringe.
It's the truth...  I need you.  I know you're innocent.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Right and don't embellish.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  Alan has put together sort of a training program
The Washington Post.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
I'm... not... nobody...
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
You mean we get `Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I was a senator, you know.
Oh.  Excuse me.
Do we have anything on the budget today?
Bob...
I'll lock him away for good.
Are you threatening me?
Dave -- I'm working.
Choices?
Yeah.  That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
This is wrong, Alan!
Wrong...
We'd like to hire you.
You mean with you and everything?
You're kidding.
I care about the homeless.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
That was quite a thing you did today.
Just souvenirs.  Towels and stuff.
How were you gonna get home?
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
Yeah.  And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
Please....shoot me.
The mainland...is dead...a dead place...nobody there...
Help me get him to the boat.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
He was a pirate who sailed these waters long ago. His name is bein' borrowed these days by the long lost Henry Dickerson.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
We got a boat.
It won't work. That's pure nitro you're dealin' with there. That stuff can blow if you look at is funny. What're you gonna do, walk into the Cave carryin' those tubes on feather pillows? You don't have a complete layout of the place. Even if you manage to avoid a fight you won't know where to go.
That entrance is closest to the labs and the Bee cages.
One day a dead man will refuse to return, and that man will be a saint. The first saint of our century. That's a prayer, too. A catechism. Something the priests tell us to believe.
Oh, I have no doubt.
I'll have somebody's ass for this. I'll have your ass, soldier. I'm not gonna stand here and...
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Actually I don't really know Mutt.
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Can you believe it?  She was gonna call me!  She invited me to a party with her!
At Chet Danburry's house.
How'd it go?  Did you read it to her?
Don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  Don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the Dead Poets Society is?   Charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
Damn it, Nuwanda.  You idiot.
Anything else you'd care to rifle through, Mr. Dalton?
I told you, that's a secret.
That's right, it's Nuwanda.
You know what really excites me about you?
Every guy that I meet wants me for one thing my body.  You're not like that.
But...
Welcome. back, Mr. Dalton.  How's your father?
Well, Meeks aced Latin and I didn't quite flunk English so if you want, we've got our study group.
All right.  I'll second that.
What good will that do?
Stop what?
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
I didn't mean to make a fool of you.
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Dead Poets honor.
They perpetuate mechanical living, sir. They limit your mind.
Meeks.
Your reprimand made quite an impression I'm sure.
I always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Mr. Keating? Sir? Oh Captain My Captain.  What was the Dead Poets Society?
I gotta get to the tryouts.  Wish me luck.
Weird.
My parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  I had to go to Balincrest to pull them up.
Yes.  But
Found what?
So?
Horseshit.  Nothing's impossible.
Listen Neil, I appreciate your interest in me but I'm not like you.  When you say things, people pay attention.  People follow you.  I'm not like that.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
what?
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
How do we get out of here?
They are...they are everywhere.
Did you clear this?
Who gives a shit about aft?
You trying to take over my show Finnegan, that what you trying to do?
What's that supposed to mean? You people.
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
How do you know that?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Hanover!! Hanover!!
Joey...it's okay...
Joey, you want to get sucked out by a giant fucking mutated squid?
Maybe plans changed...
That's mustard!
You're full of shit!
You're full of shit, Vince! You're so full of shit you're going to float away!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Where? Where is he?
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
No, I --
I came to see Merle.
Where is he???
Everybody love Linda.
I love Linda. Myself, I love Linda so much!
Yeah?
Hey, guys...
Oh, well...
Listen, Biederman, I'm going to club you into the floor unless you tell me what the fuck is so important.
Okay.
What kind of beer would you like?
It was just the complications. I mean, you take a little thing over there and then you get complications. I mean all the guys had it.
You're going hunting?
You seem... disturbed.
This is horrible!
Won't we? Right? Am I right?
I know.
I just wait. You know?
So do I.  I want to be ready... You have to be ready... It has to be there, in your mind.
What do you think about?
From Nam?
Hunt with Vince?
What else?
Merle...
With more bullets?... Against each other?... Are you crazy!!! Are you fucking nuts!!!
Three bullets -- minimum.
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
I'll betcha! That's bullshit and I'll betcha! You're fulla shit!
Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
Just forget that. Forget what it says in the book.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Great. That's great.
What?
Where?
I mean, I guess you still think about Nam. Right? I mean --
Down I would say... What would you say?
Witnesses say some wacko went Judge hunting with a late model.  I got an artist working on a computer composite now.
Talk fast.  Polls open in half an hour.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Funny guy.
Looks like you did more than jackoff while I was gone.
I told you.  I'm out of the cops and robbers business.  Retired twenty years ago.  I've been trained as a bus driver.  Got a whole route planned and everything.  Even nailed down the lingo - '<u>Exact change, please</u>'.
What's this?
You're working a partner on this.
Don't threaten me.  I tend to take these things seriously.  And get a couple hours sleep.  You look like day old shit.
We have to talk.
But sir, Sergeant Wade saved the hostages.
I got it.  I got it.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
Bacon cheeseburgers.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
You can't catch this man with a computer.
How then?
Married?
Yeah.
What's this?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You okay?
I'm going to be a policeman.
Jabez! Careful --
No, thank you -- what's your name?
Golly -- I'd like to see all your horses!
Mama!
Sure does. But I'll have to sleep on it a couple of nights.
Stevens!
No, Stone!
I'd like to know where you'd get it....
Where's everybody?
I do -- and I think you should too.
Look here now--
But you should, now that you are becoming a father.
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You know darn well it is.
Eloquent speech, Neighbor Stone -- couldn't have done better myself --  -- under the circumstances.  Thank you.
But -- I was just lucky.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
You are not so sure that he'll come.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
" ... and if the final vote shall leave thousands of our fellow citizens and their families in hopeless distress, can we -- members of the Government -- go to our beds with a clear conscience, can we, without self- reproach, supplicate the Almighty Mercy to forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors?
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Mary -- what would you do?
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Mary! Come back ...
You must go now, Mary -- you must!
Well ... make him keep quiet.
Ma! ...  Where's Mary ... and little Dan'l?
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
It seems such an obvious candidature to us all.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
Of course. And you tell your father for me -- we may be on opposite sides of the fence, but I'm always glad to hear of a man who holds to his own opinions. As long as people do that -- the country's all right. Do you understand, Martin?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Hullooo!
If it's the British Minister, take him around to the pantry and give him some Madeira --
Foreign? And who calls me a foreigner?
You can talk to me ...
Do I?  I'm sorry.  You're gonna have to help me, man.  This is my first time driving a limo.
What's happening?
No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the			* police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search			* for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan.
-- you wouldn't let me kill him when I had the chance --
Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault.
Who are you, then?
I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you?  Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion.
That was Gary Cooper, shithead...
You better heat up that miracle				* you were talking about.  We broke through on Number Six, and the Electromagentic came down like a sledgehammer...
No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough?
Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me.  Is there a place I can wash up?
It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you.
I'll be a few minutes.  Wait here --
I've spent half my life on airplanes,			* I can recognize someone who just got off one.  I'm Joe Takagi, Mr. McClane.  I have ...something to do with this company.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
'Roy'.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
No, but it's gonna need one hell of a paint job and a shitload of screen doors.  One spotters say you got two with that blast.
'Sugar, enriched flour, partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, polysorbate 60 and yellow dye #5.'
Al?  Al, you there?
Roy?  You still with us?
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
I am, Sir...Sergeant Al Powell.
What's going on?
God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.'
Aw, hey...
Hey, don't take the car!
It looks like a whole roast.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying.
I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say?
Well...
What trip?
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
So!  Sal is with you?
Yeah.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Well, then...
Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage.
Right.  See you sometime.
I'm afraid.
Who's this?
I'm not alone.
I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight ... right?
He wanted to kill me!
I want to talk to him.
He hasn't so far.  I'm the one who can make a mistake.  That's what scares the shit out of me.
Okay, is the vault open?
Believe me, I'm on your side.
Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow. What is your name?
I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero...
Where's the back door?
Let's go to the back door.  How'd that guy get to be a guard?
Don't ask me questions.  I got connections.  You find out who I am, you're cold meat.
If you take anybody, please take me.
They're like any others but they're special to me.  You got kids?  You told me; you got two.
Yeah?
What now, Sonny?
It's up to you ladies.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
When was the last time you saw Sal?
Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body.
Are you serious?  About throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
I never been up in a plane before.
Okay ... okay ... all right, Sal, it's okay.  I got everything straightened out ... it's gonna be okay.
Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay?
Hey, Sonny - You did it!
I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here!  On all 3 networks!
We can't stay here.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right.  The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway?  You got two kids on welfare now.  What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
This is Bishop.
Yes.
<i>What happened to them?</i>
She's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. You lost all credibility right there!
We need hostages. Celebrity hostages. Just in case this gets ugly. <b> EXT. NEVADA DESERT -- LATER ON </b> The Cast Winnebago drives through the desert.
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
I said stop it.
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
Make us a pot of coffee, Edna.  It's gonna be a long night. <b> EXT. FENDER COMPOUND -- MOMENTS LATER </b> Edna stands next to her MAIMED SON near the burning barrels as they watch the Winnebago drive off into the desert. Locus is sobbing... latching onto his mother's sweater.
Your theory is valid... <i>in theory.</i>
We're covered on legal with that, right?
Fast and or furious.
Ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
You almost knocked me down.  The word is "excuse me."
And?
What did I tell ya 'bout dat noise?
It's been about a year.
Fool, there's a lot in this world you don't know.
I didn't.
What makes Sammy run?
Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the corner store.  How much will it cost me?
What are you so worked up about?
One has nuthin' to do with the other.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
Motherfucker wasn't saying shit.
Why you gotta talk 'bout my moms?
Hey!  What did I say?
Mookie, get offa da phone.
Can't do.
I'm not guilty of nuthin'.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
I want you to spend some time with me.  I want you to try and make this relationship work.  If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
Your memory is really getting bad.
How long then?
Trust you?  Because of trusting you we have a son.  Remember your son?
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Later.
Fuck you.  Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the Black man will rise.  "We will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  You really believe that shit?
It's e-vit-able.
Pino, no joke.  C'mon, answer.
That's the dope.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
You really think so?
I like Mookie a lot.
We don't know nuthin' else.
Pop asked you.
Take it easy, Pop.
Ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
CHING CHONG, What happened to your beautiful Asian accent?
Depends how you define 'new'...
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
That's okay. Lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
What? Well now I'm in a position where I may just heed your help.
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Well save room for Mrs. Matthews famous baked brisket.
Wow just like Marco Polo.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
Probably because we've never met.
I don't know. I'm pretty familiar with the school and I've never seen that "X". But... I do know something.
No no no no no.
I don't think so. This guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
Shut Up! Buttlick!
Where did you learn that word?
That would be me, sir. The wife made stew last night.
When you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. It writes out all the answers on your brain.  Now how about a slushee?
Nice jugs.
LLOYD, where've you been? I've been waiting forever. I'm so embarrassed.
...cause you said...
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
No one knows?
Well, I'm listening now.
What? What did we do?
Ya know Harry, I think this whole experience has soured me on women.
You take her.
Nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  Well, I see you have a camera.
Dietician! This interview is over. You can have the camera back tomorrow. Come by the classroom. Heller heads off.
I thought I told you to get lost.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Being a jerk doesn't make you special.
Yes, what?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Well, something stinks.
Me too. I'm almost there.
That's it. I'm done.
... If I may quote the twentieth century poet  - Joe Piscahpo:  You look Marvelous...
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
You really are a pirate.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
It was meatloaf. You just put everything in your soup.
You know I do!
How was that?
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
That's not bad. How about a float of George Washington crossing the Delaware?
Let's go Margie. The museum ain't going to teach itself.
Looking for a scoop, huh? I'll give you a scoop... of short bus.  Lose her!
What?
And...?
My Lord!
So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial Ecologist?
Their minds are so.... They move in strange directions....
Yes?
I see two Great Houses -- House Atreides, House Harkonnen -- feuding... I see you behind it.
So the Harkonnens will rid you of House Atreides...
So, this is Leto the Just...
Is this what you seek?
Man-carved steps.
Are you a Fremen?
We surprised a band of smugglers.
Long live the fighters!
Are you suggesting a Duke's son is an animal?
Don't try your powers on me.  Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  Here I stand.  But... I will never be yours.
Uh, beg to differ.
I can't believe this!  <u>I</u> sleep in coffins!
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
I waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
Oh, there's my bus.  Shit, where's my transfer?!
Ah, you gotta be jokin'!  A great man like you... I'll bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
The pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  Because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  The blood. The blood is horror.
Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
I am always on time.
Well, there aren't too many other fellas I'd do it for...
Shit!  Bela, what's with the gun?
Jesus Christ, what an evening.  What happened?
Sorry...
Yeah, she's really somethin'.
Um, okay... roll camera
These shoes are itchy.
Hey Cris, how'd you know we'd be living on Mars by 1970?  How'd you know it wouldn't be 1975, or even 1980?
Dolores, give me your shoes.
Honey, what if I'm wrong?  What if I just don't have it?
Ed, the landlord called again.  He wants his money.
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, wait!
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Perhaps a small amount of money.  How much do one of your motion pictures cost?
Oh, of course!!  There's a couple characters you'd be perfect for: The secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Mr. Wood?!
Okay -- you know what you do?  You produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  And after it's a hit, you take the profits from <u>that</u>, and make the twelve Apostles' movies.
Graverobbers from <u>what</u>??
Could we moovf to table?
Well, I think you'd be a sensation in pictures.
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
My friend, you tink Greta is first woman I ever see?  No!  Many duds, before I find her.
Excuse me, Sir...?
My pleasure.  I'm Orson Welles.
Ain't that the truth!  I've even bad producers recut my movies --
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
No, no, not at all!  I <u>love</u> women. Wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
No!  It would be something better! Something <u>impressive</u>.  The biggest moneymaker you've ever had!
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Yeah?  Whatever.  So did you like it?
Maybe it needs special handling.
Oh.  Congratulations.
Oh, it's you again.
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
Stop!
Those assholes.
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
No.  I think my film is perfect for you.
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
I don't know.
Ed, you said you were getting permission.
Eddie, I'm just a small-town girl. I've never done this before.
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
Come on...
You know, for a tearjerker. The audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it's ... They know what they're doing.
You think she really likes him?
Now look. Don't freeze up on me. I picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. You're not going to lose that, are you?
Don't say that. That's like... telling a guy before you have sex you'd better be good. You don't do that.
How you doing, Ed?
Ed, do you want my advice?
Yeah, but when they went off people weren't making fun of them. They weren't bozos! I'm Pumpkin Ass again!
You know, everything you asked me to do I did. I call you for advice about Shari you say -  "Leave her be, see other people for a while." You just wanted me to get involved with Jill because it made for a better show.
Ed --
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Where are you going?
Really? They were..
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
Aah, I wanted Shari to come.
No! Like, ten years ago. In Texas. Baby...  Jessica!
Right, right...
Send him away.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
No. It's a mess.
Hey, he cheated on her.
He says --
Oh God. What hospital?
You're famous. Somebody called me. What are you doing in a place like this?
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now.
Well, no. You agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. The station entered into this on that understanding. If you had refused we'd have begun this with somebody else. You can't just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. It's not fair to us. More importantly, it's not fair to the viewers. They're interested in you. They've devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
Our what?
Never would be plenty.
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
Ed, come on. What's that gonna do? You're gonna bring Blockbuster to their knees. Let me recommend a movie to you. It's called "Get your shit together before it's too late."
I hear the dog really liked him.
Hey, believe me -1 know I've got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
Can't we just --
It's really a tremendous turnoff.
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
... yeah, then, but...
No... Could you?
But facts! They have to be verified. Anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... And whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- I'11 give you ten thousand dollars. And you get to be on Ed TV.  Hah?
That's right. You don't know. Doors don't fly open for guys like us.
Okay, I just wanted to get your attention. My name is Ray and my friend Bucky and I design video systems. You've got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
Marcia's living with a singer?
Remember the last guy she got involved with? What was his name?
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Why me?
No -- keep it.
Hello.
Who is it?
Yeah? That's good. Sorry is good. You know I finished that model.
Do you still have it?
No.
No. It's going to be about a half-hour.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
Yo --
You did it at your house?  Your own house?
In love?
I don't need a lecture on ethics, Jim, okay?  I know what --
Thank you.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
And this model comes with ABS and dual air bags standard.
Well, I... I... that's very nice of you.
You'll be fine.
That little bitch made a fool of us I want her out of the election. Getting everybody all riled up like that.  She's finished, you hear me? Washed up.
I don't know. All I know is I did it I
Hey Yeah?
Sherry... I love you.
I wanted to play next year so bad I could taste it.  And maybe go on to...
What do you mean?
And on Halloween we could have a haunted house.  But a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  You know, more like the radio station ones.  This one would be really scary.  And for Homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
And 290 "disregards," right?
You said I was a liar   You're the liar, you're the --
So?
We can't both run, can we?  We're brother and sister.  Can we?
It was Tammy I  That's who it was.
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
Don't you fucking knock?
Now could you leave me alone?
Sure, Paul.  No hard feelings.
What's it to you?
You got a brother up in Folsom.  I know because I put him there.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Do you enjoy it?
When they deserve it.
He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
I want to know about Exley.
Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell?
He helped me out once.  That's all.
Will you work for me?
You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about.
Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight.
No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming.
What's through here?
Was it... a rat?
What happened?
Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to?
You expecting problems?
Bud...
I don't have one.  Lefferts looked beat-up Christmas Eve, but didn't act it.  How come?
I think she'd been hit in the face with a tennis racket.  She is -- was -- a big doubles fan.
More.
Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right.
Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33.
More or less.
Believed what?
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me.
I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father.
Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer.
Edmund, you don't want it and you can't have it.
Why?
Part of it has to do with a murder.  I've been working with Ed Exley on it.
Have you discussed this with anyone else, John?
Damnit...
Yesterday that might've meant something.  Pull me off.  You'd be doing me a big favor.
Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again.
How was I?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
No.  This is the means to the reality.  But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
Like recognizes like.  I'm pretty tough, myself.
Do you have any proof?
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
You're back, boychick.
And Reynolds?
Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster?
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Was it a party?
Something like that.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
Me neither, but the upshot is I've got color live-action footage of you and Ms Hawkins and it doesn't look good.
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
Listen--
Yes.
You're crazy.
I don't know what that--
No shit.
What if--
And you won't. Now move--
How many years have <u>you</u> been hiding from them? How many years have you been running?  What'd they do to you?
I taped it off the 11 o'clock news.
I called my wife!
Looks like Detroit.
Well, actually, <u>you</u> have proof. Could you walk a little faster please.
Fuckin-A.
What if--
How?
Pretty fast.
What do you know about locking cellular phone signals?
Baudmore Consultants.
What do you mean? Who can buy this kind of equipment.
Tracks your location to the inch and works directly with--you know...
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
Yes. I have her permission.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
It's a little late for that.
That's 'cause I <u>wasn't</u> there.
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
Are you invoking attorney/client privilege.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Did he give you anything?
For your wife?
What'd you buy at Harrison's?
Yeah.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
It's not true.
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
Has anyone been by? Police? FBI?
The lingerie.
I'm sorry about Rachel.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
Actually, that's not true.
Brill.
Never.
Eat your fish.
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
Bullshit.
It's not me?
We'd like to ask you some questions about Daniel Zavitz.
And may I ask what could possibly be more important than Fawell Oil v. U.S. Environmental Agency?
I got a call this morning from a source I trust. The Post is running a lead this afternoon about your involvement in the Bellmoth investigation.
You're firing me.
Bobby--
That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
She can't talk to you right now.
They took the espresso machine. The <i>espresso</i> machine, Jerry! Which makes sense, you know, because the crooks probably wanted to make themselves a latte before fencing the stereo.
Why don't you give 'em a call.
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Can I talk to you a second?
That's what I want to talk to you about?
The NSA's doing this 'cause they think I have something. And they killed--
Bobby--
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No, I--
Go to 'em, Jerry.
What does that have to do with you?
What is it you want?
Yes sir.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
It's a bi-partisan issue. Everyone needs to swallow hard. No one, including you, wants to be fingered as the one obstructing efforts to crack down on terrorism, and--
What happened?
There was a transfer.
Am I to understand--
We'd have to--
And they have the video. That's confirmed.
What about the tape?
Not yet. He's near "M" and 34th. I've got an ELSUR unit on the scene now. A residential building. Twelve units.
Yes?
You have any idea what kind of position this--
You felt obliged to.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Yes.  Absolutely.
And the marriage - is that a fiction? 
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
What do you hate most?
No.
Ouch!  See - you're always beating me..!
Of course.  You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Why did you hold his collar?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there?  How can you ever smile?  As if your life hadn't capsized?
What?
It's so cold.
Shall we be all right?
Appropriate?
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle?  I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and…  Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
I was talking about the girl.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  Look!  What is that?  Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility…
In my room.
Why do they care about our maps?
Tomorrow afternoon.  Don't worry. I'll be ready.
How are you?
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Buon' giorno.
Are you planning to be the exception?
Moose.
For?
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
What did you say?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
Oh.
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
Isn't it?  Wedding present from Katharine's parents.  I'm calling it Rupert Bear.  Hello.  Geoffrey Clifton.
Oh no, really.  She has her book.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Are you remembering more?
Your friend?
Well then - yes.  Of course.
Really?  That's sudden.
Arguing about books.
Why don't you go?  You should sleep.
No!
For my hair?
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
You get Hardy.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Hello miss.
Yessir.
Katharine!
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
Kip?
Then you were married?
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Why didn't I think of that?
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
How close?
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
No. Why would I be?
Give him the card.
We're going to die, aren't we...
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Did I hear a car?
Our equipment has arrived.
I didn't mean to get personal.
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
Camera in the--
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Yes. Yes.
We're living history here.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
Got it.
Done.  And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
You shouldn't have.
But would you--would you--
So what are you going to do with your share?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
In the van.
It's too soon.
You two make quite a couple.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
See you.
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
I understand they've had a bad run of luck, health-wise, and they have my sympathies. But that's not PG&E's fault.
Tequila.  From your drug dealer friend.
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
Hi.  Donna Irving?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
You did?  Wow, sorry about that.  Listen, Mario's a little not so bright.  He seems to think that you said --
Out to lunch with the girls.
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG&E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
How many families we talking about here?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Hey.  A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you.  I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
I was just asking.  Are you all right?
Whoa.  No shit.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
And, what, I'm not serious?
Uh-huh.
<u>I know</u>.  We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
Erin?  What are you --
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Who's the judge?
Corey.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
Have you been to the water board?
I hate it too.  I hate this trip.
It happens all the time.
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
Everyone's.  This is a lawsuit.  We need to be able to contact the plaintiffs.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
Which number do you want, George?
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Cause I don't even know you.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
What're you doing?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
It's a pair of earrings.  I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em.  And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em.  Know how long ago that was?  Six months.  In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me.  That's a long time.
I can't leave my job, George.
I don't do favors for you anymore.
They up?
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Think you could learn?
Nice to see you, Erin.  We've missed you.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
Right, I guess those are the kids --
Will he finish what he begins?
Stopped they must be.  Do you hear?  On this all depends.
Told you, I did.  Reckless is he ... Now things are going to worse.
Ben ... Ben ...
Growls a reserved greeting.
Barks his concern.
I'm looking for someone.
Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if I could get my fighter out of this puddle I would, but I can't.  So ...
I don't want your help.  I want my lamp back.  I'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
... I told you, I'm not hungry.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
We haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
The son of Skywalker.  You must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
Good, and Commander Skywalker?
That's right.
I don't know, Artoo.  Sir, might I inquire what's going on?
Transport XJ. get out of here. Go!
Yes, Your Highness?
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
There's no accounting for taste. Believe me, you could use a good kiss.  You've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. It's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  I could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  But it's too late now, sweetheart.  Your big opportunity is flying out of here.
An Imperial probe droid.
Hey!  Someone's still in here.
Now you're making sense.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
Not bad, hot shot, not bad.  Then what?
No hard feelings?
I always said you were a gentleman.
That was never mentioned.  Neither was this bounty hunter taking Han. I hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
Hello!  What have we here?  Welcome, I am Baron Lando Calrissian, Administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
Nothing more can be done tonight. The shield doors must be closed. I can't wait any longer.  I'm sorry.
So much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
You don't have to do this to impress me.
I will not fail you.  I'm not afraid.
They're a lot stronger than I'm used to.
This tree is strong with the dark side of The Force.  A servant of evil it is.  Into it you must go.
What's in there?
Ben?  Ben?
Free your mind and return he will.
Go easy, Stevie.
But he isn't us.  He's your own kind.
I should.  I've been doing it half my life to Humans.
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
His reactor's starting to overheat.
Who's that?
You're my woman, you understand? You don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
Where'd you get these rigs, Carjack?
Dream on, blue eye.
So what's the deal, gorgeous?
No, that sucks.  How are we getting out?
So what's the deal, huh? Go into L.A., find the President's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I'm free?
Only a handful of people are aware of its existence. Let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Delgado?
What're you doing in here?
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
How do we get out of here?
What the hell is this?
Find Cuervo Jones.
--That is a wild boast. You lack a knight's humility.
Move aside!
Thanks to God, you are alive.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
It is whispered in the forest that...  ...Leondegrance's castle is under siege by Lot and Uryens.
I should have left you to fend for yourself.
Come now. So much anger for such a little crime? Are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?
Where have you been these many years? Is it true that Morgana--
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
I didn't know Leondegrance had a daughter.
I will ride with Sir Kay. Lancelot, rest here.
Why can't you be my champion?
Why?
Who?!
Yes. I would swear my love to you.
I'm not jealous!
I showed you all my conjuring tricks...
You know what I want. I want the secret of true magic, how to thicken the stuff of dreams and wishes with the flesh of the world.
Well, he does know the background. I doubt there's any danger in just having him assist. There should be a psychiatrist present, anyway.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
Merrin? I had notion he was over in Iraq. I think I read he was working on a dig around Nineveh.
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
What's this?
Hello? Yes this is Mrs. MacNeil. Operator you have got to be kidding I have been on this line for twenty minutes.  Jesus Christ, can you believe this, he doesn't even call his daughter on her birthday for christ sake.
Oh Burke! Poor Burke!
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
No. No rats.
Lies?
Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
We still think the temporal lobe...
Please go away.
Oh, I'm very sorry Father. Hi.
No I didn't know you had one.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Wanna drink.
Where?
Yeah.
Okay. And tomorrow night, I'll take you to a movie, okay?
You like him.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
My bed was shaking, I can't get to sleep.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
Damien Karras.
Oh, Christ.
Where'd you get the money for the Chivas Regal? The poor box?
Oh Christ! I should of been there and I wasn't there, I should've been there.
Lieutenant?
You just missed them.
No now.
You speak Latin?
Quod nomen mihi est?
...and the power to confront this cruel demon.
Why this girl it makes no sense?
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You've seen him. You're also familiar with how last week he died?
Only what I read in the papers.
I know. I read it. These desecration's in the church…you think they have anything to do with witchcraft?
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
It's possible. Possible however…
You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?
Hey, Father? You like movies?
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Yes
Are you comfortable Regan?
What's wrong with them?
They gotta go.
Don't worry, Mr. Baker.  We'll knock him out. He won't feel a thing.
Get your hand off me.
I thought these were lost. Where did you find ...
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Frank.
Count it.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Thanks.
No, I mean it.
This time you gotta go.
Nice, huh?
What's there to talk about?  She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
She'll get here.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
It's not gonna hurt you.
How about these?
Make it collect.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Day.  Wednesday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
You leaving that on?
Why would I mind?
Thank you, thank you.  You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also.  So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop.  Say hello.  Introduce yourself.  Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family.  Right, Jack?
How dare you say you love me.
What're you trying to do?  Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
You could've come.
I don't know. Some disease.
Are you kidding me?  Are you fucking kidding me?
Fuck you.
What're you doing?
Right.
I'll take the Mallory.
Right.  It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Just call me a cab.
This is where the auditions were.
We're finished.
We'll talk about it later.  Right now, you gotta get changed.
Come on.
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
I said I was sorry.
Jack, you with us?
Baker's unabridged.
Go ahead.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
Then I'm afraid I don't understand.
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
His kid's sick.
The Stratford.
Huh?
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
Every year.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
It's okay.  Last one.
Relax.  We'll drop the song.
You're upset.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
He had a mind that escalated things.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
Thanks.  For letting me in last night.
Oh?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Sure.
None?
I'm complimenting you. Can't you ever just say "thanks"?
He's lying.
Drive.
Do you know what it is to be in a coma?  It fucks up everything -- including your memory! I can't even tell you why Dobbs jumped me yesterday!
And I bet I've kept that promise ...
Is that what you think?
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad.  You went up in the plane and jumped out.  You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
Five years ... I still can't get it out of my head -- an inch to the left, Matty would still be alive.
What are you saying?  Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
He's going to kill off our bureau chiefs -- one-by-one.
Jon, what is it?
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
I've been working night and day.  I haven't had time.
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
What's it to you?  I declare it.  Here I am, back in the States for less than a month --
Mention my family once more and you're dead.
What -- what are you doing?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
We've got him sighted. Okay, Pollux, pull out.
What's the matter with your voice, Commander?
There's my little darling.  The night wouldn't be complete without you.
You've got someone in your office.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
You're both in custody until there's a DNA fingerprinting and we can prove who's who. Now put the gun down.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
Look at you, Jon -- at your age -- an American hero!  I'd buy you a drink but I know you'd just turn me down.
I just thought that -- under the circumstances -- you might want to postpone the meeting with the station chiefs.
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
The hospital.
What is with you tonight?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
I'm replacing Lazarro. Nice, safe desk job -- just like you wanted.
What's on your mind?
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Great.
What are you doing?
She didn't want me to go to London.  We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
So you left her?  Just like that?
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Who did?
Where do I go now?
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
Trouble at work?
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She said that?
Oh yeah...  What is it about you?
Hey, is that really necessary?
C’mon Jack...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
Why not?
Merry Christmas to you, sir...
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
Uh huh...
Kate’s on two, Jack.  Nice ride...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
Are you okay?
Party?  Oh no, I can’t go to a party...
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
How can you do that?
She got those shoes...
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Our life in a nutshell...
Jack.
What’s the difference? I’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
What’s going on?
You’re moving...
You can’t go!
Don’t get on that plane!
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
No...
Okay, I’ll take them...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
No...I’m not...
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
Such a sad face... You know, sometimes being different isn't a bad thing.
Maybe you should think about <u>yourself</u> for once.  You always let this guy push you round --
I had it at four.
He's made a few changes.
I'm sorry, did that cosmic-bath loosen your screws?
Okay.  I've uh, got some questions, from Sue.  That she thought might be better coming from me... Can you, you know, go to the bathroom...like normal...
Not unless you want that clipboard stretched up your --
'Course not.  Strictly business.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Where...where am I?
Reed? ... Sue?
I swear to you they've done everything humanly possible.  The best plastic surgeons in the world, Ben.  You had the best --
Don't come any closer for a sec.  This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
I'm worried about you.
Oh, he did.
It's not him.  It's <u>them</u>.  I can't live like this.
What do you mean "complete"?
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Not this again --
Stop it.
Sweet.
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Sis.  Let <u>me</u> take care of <u>you</u> for once.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've <u>got to</u> do something about this scar.  Make sure they only shoot my right side.
We've got <u>minutes</u> until it hits, not hours...Victor, that storm's <u>deadly</u> -- the radiation's lethal.  We need to abort.
Come on, Ben, come on...
I'm starting to wonder the same thing... How much do you know about what happened to you?
Feeling better?
Are you kidding?
Reed.  I was ready for the next step, you weren't, ergo, I walked.
I think it was a little more complicated than --
What are you doing?
Of course.  Of course.
Don't let Victor push you into making a mistake --
I understand the <i>business</i> reasons.
Oh, I think you already have.
I know it can't be easy.  Life hasn't changed that much for Reed, Sue and Johnny.  At least they can go out in public.  But for you?  People staring. Whispering behind your back...
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
Where do we stand?
At topspeed...and adjusting distance for Degree of Miniaturization --  The sub should get through the Heart in fifty-seven seconds.
If I were in their place and I'd run out of time, I'd abandon the ship before I grew to dangerous size... and use the few extra minutes to get out the quickest way possible, on my own...
Before or after what he wanted to tell you?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Trip? Where to?
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
Wouldn't it be quicker if we all helped?
I just wanted to thank you for taking me along.
Never saw <that>. Not even under an electron-mrcroscope.
We're pushing oxygen today.
Well, it's not exactly a pleasure cruise.
That's the trouble. I am. Being shrunk...
A long time, with one man.
Under a cloud without cause, I take it.
Doctor, what's wrong?
Looks like the molecular structure of proteins.
Mind letting me in on what's going on out there?
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
How does it look, Doctor?
What about Dr. Michaels?
At an operation?
If we can't go back, is there an alternate route?
That's just dandy. We can't go forward -- and we can't go back.
At this size, I would certainly think so.
Yes -- with all that pressure, and suction within --
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Two in a row?
We're entering the Lymphatic System. Those are nuclei of cells, lining a Duct.
May I?
Designed for Piscatorial Research -- the Spawning Habits of Deep Sea Fish.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
There seems to be something wrong with the Escape Hatch...
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
...Is this a fucking joke?
You're required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
Can I see your license and registration please?
...So maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in Brainerd.
Where is Pancakes Hause?
You'll take care of it. Boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
...You c'n'ave my truck. I'm takin' a Shiera.
You want your own wife kidnapped?
What the heck're you talkin' about? Let's just finish up this deal here -
...Blood has been shed.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
GOT IT?
Well, he never done this before, but seein' as it's special circumstances and all, he says I can knock one hunnert off that TruCoat.
Yah, ya got yer, this loaded here, this has yer independent, uh, yer slipped differential, uh, yer rack- and-pinion steering, yer alarm and radar, and I can give it to ya with a heck of a sealant, this TruCoat stuff, it'll keep the salt off -
Ah, well, we haven't had to run around like you. When're you due?
Oh, now he's adorable.
I unnerstand.
And he says, 'Yah, that guy's dead and I don't mean a old age.' And then he says, 'Geez, I'm goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
Okay, well, thanks a bunch, Mr. Mohra. You're right, it's probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
Mm.
Where you girls from?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Uh-huh.
...What's the big deal? It's an hour -
No, see, I don't need a finder's fee, I need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that's not gonna do it for me. I need the principal.
Wade's got a point there. I'll handle the call if you want, Jerry.
...How ya doin' there, Scotty?
...Babe the Blue Ox?
No. No, ma'am.
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know?  Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
Yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, I just can't read the serial numbers on your application. Maybe if you could just read them to me -
Yeah, but we have an audit here, I just have to know that these vehicles you're financing with this money, that they really exist.
Yah, well, they exist all right.
Know who this is?
Norstars.
You told me about it.
How ya doin', Wade?
Stan Grossman looked at your proposal. Says it's pretty sweet.
We might be innarested.
You're darned tootin'!
All the more reason!  I don't want you - with all due respect, Jerry - I don't want you mucking this up.
...There's a million dollars here!
Yah.
Yah? Well, what now, d'ya think?
...Last vehicle he wrote in was a tan Ciera at 2:18 a.m.  Under the plate number he put DLR - I figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
Yah, yah, course I remember.  How are ya? What time is it?
I thought, geez, is that Margie Olmstead? I can't believe it!
Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Yah?
Oh, pretty good.
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
It was a tough, uh... it was a long - She fought real hard, Marge...
I'm sorry, Mike.
Nope.
So?
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Hello?
...Well, yah. Who's this?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
Linda.
Linda Cooksey?
- looking.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
I love you, Margie.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
He's at Norstar.
I need to know where Tyler is.  Can't you help me?
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Better than I've ever been in my life.
It must've been Tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
I'm in pain.
I want that.
It's for men.
No, thanks.
I could check your prostate.
... A person.
Yeah?
Marla...
I'm sorry, I...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
Absolutely, you have every right.  I need you to do me a favor.
Two sides?  You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I'm trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, I think your life might be in real danger.
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
This is how I met --
You know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
I mean -- for a living.
The spork.  I get it.  You're very clever.
Well, uh... great.
But maybe, just maybe, you've been delivered.
The "now I get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  That list.
No, I...
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Go ahead.  Say it.
But a good strange.
Is it?
The previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
What?
No, I'm not...
What... ?
There's fight club in Delaware City.
What are we doing?
I asked you what you studied.
Why wasn't I told about "Project Mayhem?"
I'm not asking you to.
I want to hear the truth.
What are you talking about?
... is over.
He's not here!  Tyler's not here anymore!  He's gone away!
No!  This isn't true.  We... we were around other people, together, both of us...
The house is rented in your name.
I'm pulling the green wire.
I've got everything.  The bombs.  The army.  I've got Marla.
Please...
What are you doing?
Who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
Really?
What are you doing?!
Raymond K. Hessel. 1320 SE Benning, apartment A.  A small, cramped basement apartment.
Your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there won't be much left of your face.
Why?
Stuff.  That means you have to get more schooling.
What list?
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
You were there?
Here we go.  The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz.  And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two.
Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can.
Don't sweat it.  It's over.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
Like I said, it was like I was there. I remember everything.  The sounds of the crashes, the smells, the look on Shaina's face...
I know.  I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight.
You can't cheat destiny.  I know what I have to do to save us.  I have to die.
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
You got it, Dad.  I'll call you if I have a problem.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits.
Remember the departure time?
No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe.
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
Police are coming.
Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what?
Me, too.  But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks.
"Next?"
I'm sorry we broke in.
Huh?
Really?  How come he didn't take me?
... to target at Ban Kia Na.  We probe the site...
That's what I'm here for.
You read me, Brewer?
What do you call that?
We'll check it out.
Can't tell.  Pretty tall.  He's real scrunched up in that thing.
Alright.  Home run.
You never been in one of those things.
Intelligence work.
Nguyen.  He twelve now.  Not see him for eight years.
Are you okay?
Christ.  How'd you get here?
Invulnerable.
You try get across Laos?  Get to Thailand?
Yes you can.
Not yet.
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
What?
You think they'll find any?
Listen, Kirkhill.  I'm a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... I thought I'd go out with the extraction team tonight.  Unless you have an objection.
That depends on you.  Christ, look at you.  I give you this easy duty until I can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it Rambo's last stand.
Hardcore outfit.  The best I ever trained.
Five.  I never wanted that stuff.
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Fine.
Meeting ... people.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
No, I'm fine... really...
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
I was not with a woman last night.  I was out with Parry.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Thanks.
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Uh... basement I think...
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  Want some?
Huh-huh.
Your name was picked.
You get a VCR with the membership.  ... For a short time until you get your own.  Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out.  See if you're interested.
Now what?
Free?
God, I have no idea.  She's worked here for fifteen years and I have no idea.  I'll call her.
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
They said you're The One.
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I'm not married.
Do you follow her every day?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit...
It's such a great song.
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
In a bar called Hellfire.
I advise you to let us go.
It sounds exciting.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
How do you know him?
I don't drink coffee...
Well, no wonder.  We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
... It's not just from tonight.  I've known you for a long time.  I see you come out of work every day.  I walk with you to lunch.  I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in...  I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you.   I love you.  I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss.  But I'll be back in the morning.  And I won't be distant.  And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Yes.
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
What?
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
It brings out my eyes...
What?
Come on.
How far are you going to?
I saw a picture of it. Alaska is very clean. It appeared to look very white to me... Don't you think?
Well...
Wasn't it, ladies?
I'm gonna give you our number, Donnie, just in case...  We're both professionals, if you didn't guess.
Oh.
What?
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
Like what?
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Look at that.
Why are you being so mean?
Where's Catherine?!
You're leaving?
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
Bye, now.
I guess you fell in the water.
Is that funny?
No inner feeling.
What?
No, I want to talk to you now. I have to explain something about...
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
You sure you should be playing, Carl?
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
See? There's nothing wrong with the way I walk. Now where are we?
No, you're not. Go ahead and take your time.
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't know where you were, penis envy.
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
Don't call me "mack," honey.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Mass production is what does it.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
I'd like to remind you again, this isn't an opera or a musical comedy.
Please don't scream at me. I like you, but I don't like the way your attitude is.
What?
So what's her name?
They are?
So what girls are over there?
Near Natasha's? Or over by Boy's Club?
I think by Twenty-two.
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
You gonna talk to him?
Positive.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know you're not lying.
Probably.  One of the many.
Jus' from around the way.
Maybe tonight?
I think that's highly unlikely, Creasy.
It was planted on me, sir.
'Your men' might just be involved in all this.
This one's going to be even more fun.
What the hell are you doing here?
Fat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy. It began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.
Yes.
Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
Your aunt?
Mrs. Smith.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
There is?
Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Like tonight.
Nothing. They're still there.
Can I get you something?
Are you serious?
Found it in a cab. That's a grand. Apply the difference to next month.
Yes. Where you from, Harry?
Velma. You and Velma are the parents of Alan Stanwyk, Beverly Hills, California, executive vice president of Boyd Aviation?
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
And they're still married... Alan and Sally Ann.
Not mine, stupid. Yours.
It’s okay. The cops did it.
What?
We can't talk about it here.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
Why don't you try suicide?
I have the same problem with my help.
Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
I'm sorry?
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
Preoccupied with what?
No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
It's amazing.
Utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
Good point.
I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk.
Wrong. He sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
Trust you? I may seem a little goofy at times, but I'm not a complete Bozo, you know.
I'll take you to a game.
Bastard.
I would, actually.
Right. Tell you what -- have you caviar?
I'd better only get two. How about the lobster thermidor?
Fine. And a couple of bottles of Dom Perignon. To cabana one.
Excuse me. I have something I'd like to discuss with you.
This morning.
What's 'practically'? Is it Fat Sam? You said you had pictures of him....
It's called journalism, Fletch. It's called getting both sides of the story. Something you apparently don't know anything about.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
Thanks for the vote of confidence, Frank.
I want something I can print!
You were going to can me, right?
Not really.
Who's Frieda?
Mrs. Stanwyk!
Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help.  I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  What is it they call you?  Mr. Rock and...
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
That was close...
All your friends call you Jazz.
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
She's just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
Zuzu Petals!  Zuzu Petals!  Yes! Who killed Bobby Vomit?  Who killed Johnny Crunch?  Why do people want you so goddamn bad?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
Spunk, come back...
Because I know rock-n-roll.
Ford, you were right!
Reality-reality-reality -- Outrageous building, huh?
So, Zuzu.  Are you okay?
Hey, you, get off my cloud.  I'm talking to my friend.  1962 Fender Stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... Jimi Hendrix.
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
I'm sorry...
You gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
Yeah, and that lead singer, Jesus, that white Van McCoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. He looked...
How could Grendel Records sign such a wick-prick?  I guess Julian Grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  I hear Ray Charles is going to head up the video division.
Terrible thing, but good career move.  His record sales have gone way up.  I'll just have to create a new Black Vomit.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Kill them.  Not quickly.
When I was young, I read <u>Billboard</u> and I could not believe how much Grendel Records and how little of it my idiot father Old Jack Grendel got.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
I don't believe it.  Getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
How come there's nothing out there? That stuff is all milk.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
Where are you?
What's your name, asshole?
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
My friend, I am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, I am finished.
I'm going to put them on the cat.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
There may be two... no, three who could fit it.
Why not?
Where the hell is it?
When ya go back on?
Why don't you do the same, Doyle? You look like shit.
No, you?
Suspicion of what?
What the hell am I drivin' for? I'm a first grade Detective. You're a second grade guinea.
You got the warrant?
You want the red or the white?
Hey, Bo.
Forty dollars -- was $250.
Two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from New England to the South.  It was actually the first railroad through New York City.
Oh, it's been abandoned for years.
What I know is what I told you.
Frank.  Hey, man.  You alright?
Don't know what's behind it.
Where's Johnny?
I love you, Bud.
I'm off.
I've been talking to Johnny...on the radio.
I know.  He loves that thing.
The future guy?
Frank, we need to talk...
Frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Frank, please...
Frank, this is insane...
Deleon.
What's going on?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
You're still my Little Chief, right?
Right here, Chief.  Sorry I lost you last night.  Damn thing keeps cutting out.
What?  Johnny, what's wrong?
October 22, 1969.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
No.  Nobody got...  Wait a minute.  I might not know who he is, but I know where he's gonna be.  I got the case file.  We know what he's gonna do before he does it.
I'll be damned.
Dad, I think I may be able to get you enough information to make sure the DA can nail this bastard.
Well, game five was the big one.  It turned in the bottom of the 6th.  We were down 3-0.  Cleon Jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. Clendenon comes up.  The count goes to 2 2.  High fastball.  He nailed it.  Weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. Jones and Swoboda scored in the 8th.  We won, Pop.
Hang on a sec, John.
John, say hello to my wife...Julia.
Yes it is...we did this.  We changed everything.  I've been having bad dreams, Johnny. Dreams where I die...in the fire.  I was supposed to die in that warehouse.
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
John.  John, you all right?
Don't choke on your pride, Sull.  You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.
Which means he probably knew her.
Not the first time that's been true.  I'm telling you, I got a feeling about this guy.  This is the guy, Satch.
Just came by to wrap up over there. Thought I'd say "hello."
No.  No.  Well, sort of.  In my heart. Been dead 29 years.
Sullivan?
Fuck you, asshole.
Where are you going?
No more... I can't!
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Maybe we should do some exercise.
I can't find the bong anywhere. Can't you remember where you dropped it?
Your bed.
What?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
This is too painful to look at.
You promised you'd never ask me.
When you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  My parents were waiting up for me. As soon as I got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  I was so upset... I told them I slept with you.  My mothers slapped me.  That was the first time she'd ever hit me.  I couldn't believe it.  I ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as I could run. I was crying.  They had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and I wanted to punish them for that.  I decided to hide out all night.  They'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  The woods were cold and damp from the rain.  I found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and I guess I fell asleep.  All I can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  I thought it was my father so I hid behind the tree. But the footsteps just stopped. The woods were dark.  I couldn't see anything.  I heard a cracking noise behind me.  I turned around and... and... oh, God... there was this hideous looking man.  So grotesque he was almost inhuman.  He had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  I was so hysterical and I don't know how I was able to get away.  I ran and ran, but he kept coming.  He was big but so fast.  He caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. I was screaming, but who could hear me?  Then... oh, God... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  I was kicking and yelling.  He dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  Oh, please... please...
Got any good ideas?
This is no time to celebrate!
Vera... you and I have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  I like you... very much.  I was thinking that maybe.
Being a jerk is better than being nothing.
Maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
You become a whole other person when you're out here, Stan.  And I don't like it.
When you stop acting like one... Tommy Jarvis is a very sick boy. And you...
Not what...who.  Seems your boyfriend wants people to believe Jason has returned.
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
If you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see I'm not lying.
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason Voorhees is not truly dead?
I need to talk to you.
You know what I want.  You know why I need you.
Listen...don't you worry about Ed. He'll come around.  He's too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.
Maybe you should be moving on.
You're talking about my lady.
That's very colorful, chief.
Well?
I've told you the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
-- Miscarriage?!  Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
No thanks.
I have her in Creative Writing and she's fairly nice.
That was truly excellent.
Well...how do you feel?
Never mind, you don't want to know about it.
She's...she's dropping the anchors. I thought the Coast Guard could find us easier if...
Dear Christ...
They're out of town.
That's it. You're not setting foot off this ship until we return home.
What did you do with Rennie??
What a beautiful day.
You've been coming out here every summer for the last three years, young lady, and you still haven't learned how.
You're telling a lie.
Get in the boat, Rennie!
Did you know that I'm giving up teaching?
So, are you having fun yet?
I can't swim.
I got you a present.
What about you?
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
What did you find?
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
We must abandon.
I was barrister in Kenya. I said to him, get off from here. I cannot drive with your body on my windscreen.
Guys ready to order?
This is a great young out-of-work actress.
You're an artist. I'm a craftsman.
Steven Schwimmer. I memorized every word of this review.
That's awful.
I think we Nought to wait.
Don't wait Efor me.
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
This could be it.
This could Pbe it.
This could be it.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
I've got bigger problems, Joanna. Personal problems.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
They can send their heartless brilliant boy-critic. There's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.
The Red Sox
Three games to two. But if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. I've been carrying this franchise on my back since I was six years old.
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
It's all worked out. They'll lose tonight. Then they'll lose tomorrow. I see it with stunning clarity.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
Your father said you might be here.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
All right. What's been going on?
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I am really, deeply sorry.
Life is true.
Pop, will you let me in?
I'm on my way to get a haircut.
It's a constant shock to me, how small this place is. How did we do it? Five people in these little rooms.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Remember 1949? Last two games of the season. Against the Yankees. The Sox lost on Saturday. Then they lost on Sunday. First I cried for twenty-four hours. Then I had fist- fights the rest of the week.
My back is killing me.
I'm lucky they don't knock down the building. It could happen anytime. And everything worth remembering is right here.
Oh yeah?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
I don't know.
Why does it matter?
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
What do you mean?
And the Father replies?
Oh. You know him.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
You keep slipping away. How do you do that?
The fact is, I have to get going.
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
I don't know.
So everything. That's so what. So I begin to hate him. So I want to do him grave harm.
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
I haven't come to you.
Please! You're being foolish!
Is my finger supposed to be wrapped around that?
Excuse me, baas, but how long have you been in South Africa?
I am beginning to know Mr. Nehru.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
You're an extraordinary man.
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
How much extra?
A man's dead, Detective.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
That's the last.
We don't have the manpower.
It's not <i>exactly</i> him.
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
<i>More</i> than that.  You'll get used to it.
That's not the point.
I gotta stop!!  I gotta stop!!
Call German.
Where?
I'm not going anywhere.  Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
You really had other offers?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
How are you, Jerome?
Where are you going?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
My wife and I--we're thinking of starting a family.
--when you go away.
What's this, Lamar?
I told you, the government pays.  It's all taken care of.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
You know, you and I may be two of a kind.
I'm in a hurry.
What do you add up to here?
The obvious.  But we are both not interested in that right now.
Feel good?
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
Really?
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
When we had trouble before it was different.
Maybe we should split up... I'll cut the money with you.
Do you mean that?
You've got all the answers. What about when they find the body on the train?
You've got it all figured.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
You're full of ifs.
Where are you going?
We're going to make it.
I don't want to hear it.
We've come a lot of miles. But we're not close to anything.
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
Oh, Jesus... how?
Laughlin. He's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
Are we going to make it?
What now?
Three years ago I dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
What do you have in mind?
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
And I keep my mouth shut?
How?
What happened to this car?
What's it got to do with you?
What about the brakes?
What?
Good evening.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
Nicer than most.
Yes.
What?
I know him too.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
While he was here. You went about together?
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
So where are we going, Princess?
How'd you know where I'd be?
What does he want that bloody great country place for?
Entertaining.
Tell me about the girl.
The young girl. Who pulled her?
Is it one of Kinnear's films?
Did my brother Frank find out?
Oh, what you doing now?
Yeah.
Where you going to live, then?
Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
Ah, Edna, come in. Join the tea set.
Get knotted.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Definitely.
Will this do?
My brother, Frank.
They bloody hurt me.
That little shit!
What you going to do?
And that'll make me feel better?
What you going to do?
Didn't you know this is my home town?
Oh, you've been watching television.
Still got a sense of humour?
Oh, Cyril, eh? So it's all girls together, is it?
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Put it away, Jack. You know you won't use it.
What's that? A hundred?
That, Harry? That's another hundred - twenty-five pounds notes of the realm.
I'll see you, then.
...Polacks...
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
I had to.
You ever get 'em?
They did.
They killed the goose.
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It is.
Eh?
All of, they got you on this "board..."
I, I...I...
It's not.
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
To say "I'm going on my own." 'Cause what you do, George, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. And we enslave ourselves.  To please.  To win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
You don't ax your sales force.
You...
...you're absolutely right.
What?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Graff?  Because I worked for him.
Yes.  I mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
As a "robbery"?!  No.
You didn't?
You're going to steal the leads?
Yes.
What will he pay?
You have to steal the leads tonight?
You want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
Why would I do it?
Are you sure?
You went for it.
So I'm making it concrete.
Yes.  They are old.
They're ancient.
That's...
Everything I...you know...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
Yeah.
They aren't?
Where was I?
Where did Moss...?  I...
Will you excuse us please?
...how can you talk to me that... that...
The leads come in, I'll let...
Shelly, you blew the last...
...do you want to go downtown...?
Lately kiss my ass lately.  That isn't how you build an org...talk, talk to Murray.  Talk to Mitch. When we were on Peterson, who paid for his fucking car?  You talk to him.  The Seville...?  He came in, "You bought that for me Shelly." Out of what?  Cold calling.  Nothing. Sixty-five, when we were there, with Glen Ross Farms?  You call 'em downtown.  What was that?  Luck? That was "luck"?  Bullshit, John. You're burning my ass, I can't get a fucking lead...you think that was luck.  My stats for those years? Bullshit...over that period of time...?  Bullshit.  It wasn't luck. It was skill.  You want to throw that away, John...?  You want to throw that away?
Yes.  I am.  I'm sorry to antagonize you.
John.  John...
I will close.
I've got Roma.  Then I've got Moss...
The leads are coming.
You are?
How do you know I made it up?
Well, hadn't it?
I don't know what you are saying.
How much did you get for them?  How much did you get for them?
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Because I don't like you.
Shit.
You closed 'em today?
...and you don't remember. 'Cause you weren't around.  That's cold calling.  Walk up to the door.  I don't even know their name.  I'm selling something they don't even want.  You talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
I wanted to speak with you about...
Ray is director of all European sales and services for American Ex...  But I'm saying you haven't had a meal until you've tasted...I was at the Lingks' last...as a matter of fact, what was that service feature you were talking about...?
Which...
Home...
Yes.  Is this something that I can talk ab...
You're sure?
What?
Kenilworth...?
Yeah.
I've got to talk to you...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
No, I don't know.  Tell me.
Jim, Jim, you saw my book...I can't, you saw my book...
When did you write the check?
No, Jim.
She told me I had to get back the check or call the State's att...
What?
Fuckin' cop's got no right talk to me that way.  I didn't rob the place...
Is that what I did?  Dave?  I humiliated you?  My God...I'm sorry...
Who's my pal...?  And what are you, Ricky, huh, what are you, Bishop Sheean?  Who the fuck are you, Mr. Slick...?  What are you, friend to the workingman?  Big deal.  Fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  I never liked you.
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They didn't get the contracts.
Yes.
Where are you going?
I'm giving you three leads.  You...
We had a slight burglary last night.
...Mr. Williamson...
No, where is it?
Will you take me?
The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about.
Michael, Fredo's in the house with Mama.  He asked for you, and Tom said he couldn't see you.
Deanna, will you get back into the house!
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
You would risk your life for strangers?
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
We're making an investment in Havana.
Pentangeli's dead.  He was ambushed by the Rosato Brothers.  Didn't you know that?
I want you to help me, Fredo.
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
You?  What do you mean you, I thought...
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
The same man who tried in Nevada... Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli.
He's an Italian?
Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel?
Beautiful.
What?
In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
Within the compound will be fine.
How long does this go on?
When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Why didn't someone tell me!
Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom?
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I asked about Fredo?
They can come in now.
Go on, tell me.
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
It might show.
What's up?
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
What the hell are you talking about?
Our mistake.  But what does it matter; it was our money.  We don't even expect thanks.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through.
You would have killed his brother?
Goodbye, Michael.
No, I don't want to hear anything. There are things between men and women that will not change; things that have been the same for thousands of years.  You are my wife, and they are my children... and I love you and I will not let you leave, because you are MINE!
Well, we can all have a nice dinner together tonight.  How are your eyes?
Sit down, this is almost over.  You follow the baseball games?
It's always bad for business; but you have no choice.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
I wouldn't consider anyone else.
Says who?
Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches.
Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle.
Turnbull is a good man.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
He don't want to talk?
Are we going to eat or what?
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
What's this?
How much more a month?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Just thinking out loud.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened.  It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
I like my life.  I'm a free man.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Your wife?
You ever been married, Hanna?
You and he are not doing things?
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Good morning.
You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive.
You mean -- you really want to draw me?
And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
That shirt, Mr. Boone.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
Full up.  I got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by La Cienega.
I'm not, you know.
Not at the moment.
After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself.
You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today.
I don't get it.  First you creep me out with homo shit.  Then you hit me with war stories.  And now you're upset because I listen? What do you want?
Good afternoon, Clayton.
Actually, no.  I feel a little out of place.
The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist.  He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.  They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
So it is going to happen after all.
No.  It won't do.
You are much too human.
Just take off the fucking mask!
I'm not that way.  Get it through your fucking head.  I don't want to mess with you.
Did I hurt you?
Hey, Boone.
Where's Betty?
I'm sorry, Jimmy.  But with this movie and two difficult stars --
Thank you.
You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
You know what I mean.  Your reputation.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
Uh-oh.  The way you look at me, James.  What have you done this time?
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
Does the yardman come today?
That is my daughter.  She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy.  I will make it short.
And this is your house.  Wow.  The house of Frankenstein.  I thought you'd live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
Can that count as one question?
He's one of the great images of the twentieth century.  As important as the Mona Lisa.
Mr....Kay?
I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
How's the leg?
We can learn something from our Asian friends. They smoke a thousand cigarettes a day; they're completely stressed and overworked; they drink like, well ...
Yeah -- ?
They gave you only four days?
One more night --
How is he?
You know my back -
Kip.
It's funny. There's probably been five more cars stolen in the time I've been here ...
What's this -- ?
No faith in our new-found goodness, Detective ...?
When'd you get to town, Raines?
Where you been, anyway?
You'll get the hang of it, kid. You just need to remember one thing -
So? Tell me: how come they call you "Freb" anyways -- ?
Donny --
Forget that ...
Most of 'em are late-model...
How's it going -- ?
Dignity...
No ... And they won't take my calls ...
You look good...
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
I knew it. He's changed, Randall. He's a different boy. He's lost that... That sweetness ... It's gone ... And I don't know what to do ...
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
Yeah ...
About Calitri? No worries, man. I'll call him. He's a reasonable dude ...
C'mon, man... My "demise..."  Overreaction
I can handle it --
I can handle it --
What are you doing here?
Thank-you ...
What era was that -- ?
As opposed to now, Kid Car Crusher?
What?
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
You okay -- ?
Thirteen down ... Thirty-seven to go ...
Take it back, Freb --
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
Hell, yeah. I'm not getting rich in here ...
Six or seven...
No ... ?
I think so... They're just... So ...
The alarms go off ...
Cut 'em...
What -- ?
Am I dying? Are all the angels of my life returning to bid a final farewell?  And have my angels completely lost their fashion sense -- ?
Whatever do you mean?
His criminal career has officially come to a close ...
What happened to Sway?
Why do you call it "Eleanor?"
Why don't you leave him alone?
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
What thing? The Brooklyn thing?
Just stay away from the garbage. Yon know what I mean.
Anybody!  You understand?
But, Paulie, I'm sorry. Believe me.  I was fucking crazy.  But I'm okay now. I can be trusted.  I'm clean now. On my children. Believe me! Two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Here. Take it.  Now I gotta turn my back on you.
What are you gonna do?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I'm gonna need some money.
I don't care. Something's going on.
We've got to help each other.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
Don't worry about it.
Paulie's gonna make him?
It's that rat bastard from Pittsburgh. He ratted you all out. He's been a rat since he got busted in Pittsburgh.
He heard.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
Yeah.
Now this is important. Make sure you leave the house when you make the call. You understand? Do you hear me? It's important.  Call from an outside phone. I mean it.
Tommy. He. doesn't mean anything. Forget about it.
Tommy.  Come on. Relax.
Is it my fault she won't go out without her girlfriend?  For Chrissake.  Come on.  You don't even have to stay.  Jeesuz!  What's the big deal?
Ma!  Stop! What do you want me to do?
I don't want them left back.
Who's she talking to?
What?
Suck my crank. Fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  So, when are you done with those meetin's?
Why is it always this? I owe it to myself? What if I don't want to?
How'd you know where to find me?
I told you, I just got change.
Why you gotta be an asshole Chuckie?
I'm not sure--
I'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
Really?
That's right.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Half-red, half-black--
Can I ask you a favor, can we do this at Sean's from now on? 'Cause I leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
Will, on your own time, you can do what you like. When I set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
--Maybe I don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
I can come back.
You know, you're no longer required to come here.
Thank you.
Yes.
I know. We just couldn't wait 'till Monday to find out.
Good to meet you.
Excuse me, Timmy. Could you help us? We're trying to settle a bet.
Hello.
Good to see you.
You're from the same neighborhood. South Boston.
Not Rick? You didn't send him to Rick?
Any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
Sean, I really don't think you understand--
I do.
I know what I'm doing and I know why I'm here!
Yes you do. You're angry at me for doing what you could have done. Ask yourself if you want Will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
I don't blame you! It's not about that! It's about the boy! 'Cause he's a good kid! And I won't see this happen to him-- I won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I don't know... Gotta be at least four to one.
There is somebody...
It's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I'm married and I have two children.
Yeah, I read those.
I'm not here for a fuckin' book report. They're your books, why don't you read 'em?
I did.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yes, I do.
How'd it go?
I teach this shit, I didn't say I knew how to do it.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
They could see that I meant it.
But you can't give back to them, Will.
I didn't want the job.
I been there. I played my hand.
Oh, this is your file. I have to send it back to the Judge with my evaluation.
Twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--No, have you had any experience with that?
It's not your fault.
Thanks you.  So, that's it? We're done?
I just want you to know, Sean...
No. Thank you.
You suck.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
It was great. There was always someone to play with, give you advice.
I'm supposed to understand this.
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
I want you to come with me.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Yeah.
You doin' the hirin'?
'F we're workin' for you, it's our business too. An' how do we know--  --you ain't one a the guys that sent these things out?
Okay. I think you're a darn fool, though.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
Looks like about a mile. Reckon she'll make it?
You mean that hitch-hiker? Little short fella with a pale face?
Them wasn't two-for-a-cent candy.
What's it to you?
Two.
House 25. Number's on the door.
Two and a half cents.
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Crate fell on me.
Say, ain't you young Tom Joad--ol' Tom's boy?
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Pa always said you was never cut out to be a preacher.
Have a little snort?
She's settlin'.
What's the matter?
Thought you was in jail.
Women is always tar'd.
But we can still do it, honey.
Goin' far?
You ain't got to get sore.
Me neither. I'm just tryin' to get along without shovin' anybody around, that's all.  See that road up ahead?
You been acrost?
I could break up some bresh if you want me, ma'am.
What you mean you ain't goin'? We *got* to go. We got no place to stay.
You know what I al'ays said: "Tom'll come bustin' outa that jail like a bull through a corral fence." Can't keep no Joad in jail!
What's the matter, Grampa?
How 'bout Granma?
California.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Where you think you're going?
Whatta ya mean? You ain't et today.
Don't it ever scare you it won't be nice in California like we think?
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Now don't get sassy, Ma.
Granma's dead.
An' that's why you didn't want 'em to look?
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.  They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn--  --she gonna have her baby, but *it* ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
What is it?
No, Ma. Not that. That ain't it. But long as I'm a outlaw, anyways, maybe I can do sump'n. Maybe I can jus' fin' out sump'n. Jus' scrounge aroun' an' try to fin' out what it is that's wrong, an then see if they ain't sump'n could be done about it.  But I ain't thought it out clear, Ma. I can't. I don't know enough.
Could you see your way clear to sell us a loaf of bread, ma'am.
Whyn't you buy a san'wich? We got nice san'widges.
Oh, them? Well, no--them's *two* for a penny.
But we couldn't *do* on any less'n what our share is now.  The chillun ain't gettin' enough to eat as it is, and they're so ragged we'd be shamed if ever'body else's chillun wasn't the same way.
Ya know, you're the second fella talked like that. I'd like to hear some more about that.
But what does *that* prove?
If this don't beat all!  Well, I see you been busy already!
Git up. I got sump'n to show you.
Ain't gonna be no trouble.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
Marty, you haven't changed a bit!
So, what are you doing now?
I sell BMW's. What do you do?
Remember high school?
What do you want to do?
That's it?
What's your business?
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
That's part of it.
Bad experiences.
Seven it is.
Hello...?
Do you want to get a drink first?
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
Which would you rather...?
Like love?
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
You don't understand...
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
How do you know?
Say more.
Yes.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
I work alone.
Up on the right.
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Thank you, no.
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
Hello, Bob.
That's strictly Bàader-Meinhof stuff.
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I have scruples. Next.
Don't forget your identity.
Of course you will.
Marty! It's me. Paul.
It didn't work out.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
Martin, I don't know where you've been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and I don't care. It was good that you left, and I'm glad you did. So what do you want to talk about? You've grown up a bit. Maybe I had you figured wrong.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
Need a lift?
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
What?
I don't believe this!
You buckled up?  You cold?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Let's bring your bags inside.
Good.
Is that absolutely necessary? It'll just make it a bigger story.
I should go get some of her things.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
Why did you go?
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
What if she doesn't want to go?
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Yeah, what?
Take your time.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Where to?
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
It isn't right to make him suffer...
What?
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
I don't believe it.
She gonna be long?
Isn't it like, obvious?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
I know where he goes.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
I know. Amazing.
You just showing off for her!
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
What are you looking at, young man?
Listen to this bullshit.  "This is our world now. The world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. We exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. You wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. I am a hacker and this is my manifesto." Huh, right, manifesto? "You may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
I can't. Everybody who touches that thing gets busted, I can't afford to get arrested, I'm sorry.
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those Gibsons man. You know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
Cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
Yeah. Probably had something to do with that bank in Idaho.
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Right. Anything else, you want me to mow the lawn? Oops, forgot. New York. No grass.
I'm sorry. Who are you?
You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you.
Talk to me.
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Look out, man. Lisa Blair, 26 East 7th St., apartment 16, 555-4817, BOOM!
Jesus, I gotta save all your asses. I help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
Think you can do better?
He's not in this class.
What?
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
You sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
I'm sorry, I can't.
Kate, listen.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
So, um, what's your interest in Kate Libby, eh? Academic? Purely sexual?
Gill.
Must have been hell, huh? Zero Cool?  A virus has been planted in the Ellingson Mineral computer system. You were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
Colonel who?
Mr. Belford?
My name is the Plague.
As in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
I need a handle, man. I don't have an identity until I have a handle.
Dude dude dude, I gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. I copied a garbage file from...
Hello?
I'm freaking! Joey wasn't making it up! He really hacked into Ellingson! He gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I'm in jail! They're charging me with some serious shit! And there's stuff I didn't even do, like inserting some virus called Da Vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
The little boat flipped over. A virus planted in the Gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
I had to move fast. The hacker copied my garbage file.
I created Mister da Vinci so we could call in the Secret Service. So they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
Send a Flu-shot.
555-4202.
We need to talk.
When did you find this out?
I mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
What's going on?
Is there another key?
Brady!
When did this happen?
You'll have to watch Jamie tonight.
Can't you find somebody else?
What am I supposed to tell Brady? Sorry, but I've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
How do we look?
We'll be at the Fallbrooks. The number's next to the phone.
Found it.
We should call the fire department.
How many people in the bus?
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
Your lucky.  I wish she could do the same for me.
I don't want to.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Rachel come on.
You know Rach, Discount Mart is having a sale on Halloween costumes.
I know! Don't you want to talk to him?
I don't want to look pushy.
Maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
10 years ago he tried to kill Laurie Strode, and now he wants her daughter.
Its true, Sheriff.
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.
I'd say you must have the wrong number.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
I don't want to.
You idiot!
My parents won't be back till ten.
May be a few minutes. I gotta stick around here...
Ten minutes.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Where?
As usual, I don't have anything to do.
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
Uh-uh. That's a spook house.
After the movie.
There is no such thing.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
We're no getting anywhere. All right, look, Tommy. The bogyman can only come out on Halloween night, right?
Promise?
Laurie, you come with us...
Yes, she is.
She's washing her clothes.
Of course not.
There's nothing else I can do.
Only minimum security.
What does that mean?
Are you really interested?
Oh, is that what it is?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
Oh, geez, yeah.
It depends on what way you want to go.
But I'm seeing him.
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
Is this your first job?
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Could you--
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
You're out looking here?
Where are you headed?
Oh.  You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
Yeah.  How are you?
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
He's got like six gold records.
Oh!
I was looking for you.
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Where're you going?
Are you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
How do you know?
How about something to eat?
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people.  I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
...or films you must see or... 
Why?
Because I have to!
Oh, Christ!  What's wrong with you?!
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
But there's nothing wrong with you.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
Like what?!  What?
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
Oh, yeah?
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
I know...I know.
Huh?
I like him.  I think he's a sweet guy.
I know, I know.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
I want to experience childbirth.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Yeah.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
He's not a loser at all!
Here.  Be careful with those.
Well, how about this?
Really?
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
I remember you.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
You look wonderful.
It was a terrible evening.
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Well...
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
It's great.  I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless.  I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  I don't know what to say.  I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat.  I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned.  This is not an insult.  I'm amazed that you can...  It was-- I just thought it was great.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again?  I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
Yeah, well, what's your religion?
...read it over, and think about it.
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
I'm going to tell you later....
I have not read you your rights.
And now I have "dociled" you, have I not?  By forcing your obedience.
I'm struck by your phraseology.  I did not <u>last</u> with him.  I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
That would adversely impact my income.
Say it in English.
...they did it for a lark.
Mason Verger.  For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  Can <u>you</u> be free....?
Brigham.  Go.  Affirmative.  Okay, Happiness is a Green Light.  We've got Evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  The dope's D.E.A.  <u>We</u> want her on Interstate Transportation of some firecrackers.  Starling:  you've got Drumgo, you know her from before.
Atrocious Torture.  Hit of the Season, you want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.
I like Popcorn...
He is...?
You should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
Yes, I did.
I don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what I'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these Warriors, ¥our cobbled together Strike Force?  I'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
...what'm I looking at...?
And how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. Then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>America</u>...
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
It is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce.
Darling...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
Do you like it at your home, Franklin?
Yes.  Franklin, you can't live there anymore.  With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat.  You have to go away.
You were given backup....
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
Thank you, Cordell.
...might I make a suggestion...?
...when I... 
Alcohol.  Where both its life-enhancing And its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some Hindu <u>God</u>...
You should get Married.
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
I don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
Trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
I don't understand.
...they asked us to dinner.  How can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
Thank you.
What're they on about?
Then tell me.
No.  That's right.  That's all part of it.
I told that woman I'm an orphan.
That's right.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
I..
When?
Yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
No really, keep talking, I ree-ally want to hear what you have to say, you're just so eloquent...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Now what? What did I do this time?
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
You're a little harsh on Todd. You're a little harsh on everybody.

"or you're going to get it?" Wow, first week of camp. Promise me you won't try moving so fast with Wichita.
You know you just do this for shock value. It's not shocking.
I'm not a nai-ive little...
One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
Stop, stop, what was I thinking...out in the wilderness.  Under the stars. I've ruined every--
I just never thought of you in that...
So what?                                                    ]
I should leave. You probably need your rest.
Stop!  Stop it, this afternoon was not what you thought...I overheard you and Pixel, at the side of the mess hall, your idea about the "test"...Do you believe me?
I'm really sorry I couldn't make it to your birthday party last month.
Ever since Phil Collins did that MTV anti-drug commercial I refuse everything.
Save the speeches for Malcom X. I just wanna get laid.
Because you're an idiot.
I'm sorry? What are you oozing about?
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Yeah, she really wants to talk to you.
Shit.
Probably....
I don't know. Should you?
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
And your worst enemy.
We did a murder. In Ohio, that's a crime. But if this was like a suicide thing.....
We don't want to make them out to be too secretly eloquent. Why would the Germans invent a bullet that doesn't kill people? I mean it <u>was</u> World War Two, not a school play.
Yeah, but don't worry, it was worth it just to see the look on....
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
It's over, J.D.  Over!
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Veronica is into his act. No doubt.
I think so, man.
Veronica! J.D. told me you committed suicide last night!
That's three things.
This story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.

I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
Can I go now?
Well, I guess I take after you then!
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
My name is Gina!
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
looks startled at the outburst.
Fruit.
To be known as He!
You're such an incredible woman.
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Isn't it beautiful!
Are you a dream too?
What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality.
Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife?
If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
I understand... I won't-
Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death.
What's the occasion?
So you're just packing it up just like that?
Yeah? You and who else?
Bret... what the fuck...?
What did you just say?
Zero's a number right?
What's wrong, Trev?
Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding.
Kirsty... Kirsty?
Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
What evidence?
Morgue...?
Ambulance.
Two.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
I don't know who you are or what you want. I just want to know what's under that sheet...
But I saw these women. I saw their mutilated bodies. I saw their ghosts. I just know it happened I can feel it...
But that's what I need. To be sure... to be absolutely sure...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
Tawny I think I'm going to be sick.
Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night.
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
I was in the can, for Chrissake.
You'll tell him I talked you out of jumping, right?  Just keep me outta prison.
What's going on?  "Guilty"!  What is this?
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
You whaaaaaat?  You paid it?  You gave a bondsman ten percent?
That fake <u>inspired</u> you to loan a guy who's been fired off his job <u>twenty-five hundred</u> goddamn dollars? A guy you say is probably gonna <u>do</u> <u>time</u>!  You're s'posed to be an <u>attorney</u> for Chrissake!  You're s'posed to have <u>good judgment</u>!
Take a look at my employment record, you got my employment record there, right?  You see any unemployment there, any welfare? I'm a taxpayer.  They eat me alive, the tax people, they got taxes on everything, taxes, taxes, taxes, and forms!  Taxes and forms so I can pay your goddamn salary, so you can sit there and write stuff, guys like me pay your wages...
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
THAT'S IT!  YOU TALKED!  YOU'RE FIRED!  OUTTA HERE!  GET OUTTA HERE!
Willya lemme talk for Chrissake? I'm trying to tell you what happened.  What happened is...
That's what I'm trying to... to... okay, nevermind.  Just lemme talk to Joey to... to apologize.
He had one <u>tiny</u>, uncharacteristic moment of weakness.  That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free.  I'm a veteran reporter.  I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
Underbelly!
What picture?
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Gale!  I can't go through with this! It's... it's all wrong!'
I just remembered.  You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
It's not right, Gale...
There's a lot of confusion around what went on last night, it's not clear...
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
He's right.  It's unprofessional.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
She's talking to him now.
Listen, Deak, what if Bubber <u>has</u> got something to hide?  What if he's the wrong guy, not really the hero...?
It's not unthinkable.
What about?
I didn't ask him.
Inspector Dayton, the cop from Robbery Detail who was looking for you.  They caught the guy who stole your credit cards trying to sell them and he wants...
So where are all your toys?
Well, it's for a woman.
Right.
-- institution.
That would be stupid.
Things are beginning to come to a head.  I can feel it.  And I want everything to be perfect.
Oh, well, do you fix refrigerators?
Well, can I make an appointment?
I bet.  Going into people's homes.
It's nice that you can make that choice.
Yeah, I'm okay -- it's been a long night.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Have you just plain asked him?
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
Where'd he go?
Honey --
Did you hear what he said?
Huh?
No.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
I <u>remember</u> what day you wore that jacket.  It was <u>Monday</u>.  The day you were all day in <u>meetings</u> again?  And had to send out for <u>sandwiches</u>?
I don't care, Philip.  You want to go chasing Barbara Zelman, go ahead.  Just watch out for those buck teeth.
Do you usually pay for Charlie? At "Trattoria <u>Valentino</u>"?
I don't know -- put 'em in the drawer with all the Chinese take- away menus.
The floor has a nice shine to it.  Oh God -- we have twenty-two messages on the machine.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh God.
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Is it a king or a queen?
That's right -- you got the bill this morning.  I put it on your desk.
Promise?
Parker.  We found him knocked out in the can.
Why are people walking around New York with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
What is it?
Anything from the bank?
I'm in the middle of an interrogation, Captain.
What?
You didn't bring me here to talk about her.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
No.
You sure?
Seven years ago I interviewed a guy. He said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  One cut off the others head.  He shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
Most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
Yes -- I think it is.
Since we hardly know each other, I'm sure you'll understand if I hold one to it for awhile.
I know that weapon.  It belonged to Juan Romeriz.  He's dead?
No.  He was my brother.  He died at anothers hand.
It is a beautiful day.  I am merely enjoying it.
Life.  You've stopped living it.  You look, but you do not see.  You listen but, you do not hear.
I'm sure they will.
That is a thought that doesn't please me.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
I'll go first.
What do you think?
I would like to say goodbye.
Aye?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
About what?
I'm interested in mythology.
Alright.  In the shop you mentioned something about--
So?
On the back it has--
We found him this morning.
It flatters me you remember, old one. It's been what... two hundred years?
Oh -- I almost forgot.  Your head.
It will not end tonight.
No.
Is there anything else you need?
Yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
Worst case, it's a bloodbath.  The detectives come out with Smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass Go.
Maybe we're getting too dramatic.  It's three kids.  They'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  Why would they search the house?
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
Bullshit!
Not if they don't catch us, Kevin.
That's why we gotta keep going.  I'm not gonna go in for murder.
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
Dennis?  I want you to release those people.
Now I understand.  That helps.  I can make them understand that.
What if it goes south?
Goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  Did the cops go in?  Did Smith have the disks?
I need to work out some stuff.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
Shh, they'll hear you!
What happened?
That's not enough.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Did he say if she was shooting at him?
Go, Chief.
Call Jane for me.  She's at the little Thai place.
Could you call me back on your phone? Right away.
He says that his father's hurt.
The truck is registered to Dennis James Rooney, white male, twenty-two.  He has an Agua Dulce address.
How do you people expect this to work? The Sheriffs have a Crisis Response Team here.
Not until the man calls.
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
Where's the office?
That's on the second floor.  Could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
Yeah!  Here's a name.  This is somebody's personal tax --
Who are you?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
I guess we do.
Gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
No, Bik, it's a code word for Tutsis.
You heard the Tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
Please, I don't use guns.
Give me it.
Don't be foolish. There's more money to be made here.
Yes. Where are the Rwandan police?
That explains it. I'm sorry to tell you this but we've heard rumors the Militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
A discussion between an American Embassy official and a UN Colonel.
And what will they do with these satellites?
I am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. Perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
I will see what I can do.
Pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
For supplies, you drive.
Did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the Diplomat with you? You know?
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
I'm going to put you on the third floor.
Yes they are. However if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
This won't do.
Has Roger spoken yet?
What about us?
I have to, Tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
I had you transferred to Kigali.
What?
To be closer. So that I could marry you.
I want to know.
A Volkswagen.
I love you. Keep the children safe.
Our children cannot see us die first. If the Militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. I will meet you there.
Paul Rusesabagina, Mr. Godefroid. The house manager. I met you on your last visit.
I managed to get the President of France on the phone.
You have taken business class?
Paul. Are you alright?
What is his room number?
Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
And what's Steven's status?
-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
Where is it??
I'm sorry --
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
You said that was an accident.
Oh, Jesus....
Why not?
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
Cheery looking bunch.
Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
Or an on-line computer.
This is the best we're gonna do.
It's succeeding!
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
-- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown.
You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
Then who are they?
It you really loved me, Steven, you'd find a way to drop dead in the next three seconds.
-- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it.
So how's a girl to know if these things are loaded, baby?
First time for everything.
Please! Something! Oh-God!
What?
House 2, Guests 0.
I'll take my chances.
Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --
The lockdown thing.
Pretty amazing feat: all that shit down the basement and your wife's up in the bedroom the whole time.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Of course he did, for God's sake.  Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
Oh, no.
Won't do any good.
And you think it's in there?
-- hey! --
I feel something.  It's faint, but...it's there...
Did you find her?!
Where does this amulet come from?
The dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
By freeing them.
It's going to hurt us!
Where are we going to go, mommy?
Oh my God!  She's in there!
It's just going to take a while.
Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
What?
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
...at her request.  She was a very religious woman.
I'm going to need some blood.  It must be from a woman.
Why?
I hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
What are you getting at!
No.  But I'm a clairvoyant.  I can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
The cusp of my life.  What I was, what I am, what I will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  I was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. Opening the Box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
Why are you so interested?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
I'm trying to quit.
The bank owns it.  But I'm working on it.
Woah.  Wait a minute.  Who?  The kid?
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
No.  Sorry.  Not interested.  Not for my customers.  Have you tried ...
Never mind.  I'm glad it's gone.  Made the store feel strange.  Who'd make such a thing?
Can we see?
Thank you for the drink.  And the rose. Wow.  That's ... really nice.
Everyday I have my friend Rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  And I award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
... Let it define you.  Whatever it is. Most of the roses die behind the bar. This is the first I've given out for nearly a month.
You shit.  Who do you think you are?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
Yeah really.  I'm ...
Oh, I don't ...
A girl?  Anyone I should know?
Just means it'll take you an extra 31 seconds to seduce.  You re still the best, I know it.
Cameras?
They record everything their video surveillance takes in...
You got about five minutes and change.
You re not thinking of going to...
Why not just go now?
Get 'em.  They went down the hallway.
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
What the hell....
You got it.  Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline.  I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.
I'm sorry.  I can't.  I....
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
Catholic girls are scary...
You really went and did it.  With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it.  Nobody does it better, Hudson.  You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Cat got his tongue?
How many times do I have to say it?  I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp.  I actually found him, "endearing."
Hawk, you're a great thief.  Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of.  Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
Come to think of it there is a part of your body that you won't need for your next job...
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
Yes.
You certainly do.
I hate a man with a sense of humor.  While you corn dogs were comparing the lengths of your masculinity, we obtained the helicopter the new fashioned way: a thoroughly corrupt business deal.
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Good news, bud, the Mayflowers have moved up the time-table. You're hitting the Vatican to-night.
Hush.  My employer wants a meeting.
Employer?  The president?
Hawk, Hawk, Hawk.  Enjoying Italy?  I always had a soft spot for Rome.  Did my first barehanded strangulation here.  Communist politician.
Why does this have to be so hard...
Something short.
Ah guess ole Moses knows jes about ever'thing, leastways if it concerns Hudsuckuh.
I don't tell no one nothin' lessen they ask. Thatches ain't ole Moses' way.
I'm happy enough.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
Smitty.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
Phony, huh?
Watch it, Archer --
You can't print that!
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Get up!
And Sid says you stole it!
Norville.
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yeah, yeah, it's the standard resignation boilerplate -- go down to the second paragraph.
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Well, I made the dean's list.
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
There's one in every story.
...adenoids.
What's this?
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
Believe me, Mrs. Rand, he doesn't do this often. This is the first time I've seen him --
I've no influence with Mr. Holland.
Some of this native nonsense. The Houngan has his prescription and Dr. Maxwell and I have ours.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You don't believe in it?
Frankly, my dear, I didn't expect anything like this from a nice level-headed girl.  What are you driving at?
I knew you'd come. And I knew I'd have to come up here and talk to you. I couldn't let you go back without any word. I came to tell you again -- Jessica cannot be cured.
Mrs. Rand...
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell.  But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway.  There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland.  But you've already met him.
And that chair --  is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
I don't know.  He spoke to me last night on the boat. I liked him very much.
Where do you think you're going?
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
I'm not sure I can make you understand.  You know what this is?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
You don't seem very disturbed by it.  I've always thought Voodoo was something to be scared of: the drums sounded in the hills and everybody was frightened.
I know what you went through tonight.  I kept thinking of what you said: that all good things died here, violently.
You have deliberately endangered Mrs. Holland's life.  There's no telling what you may have started with this insanity.  Why did you do it?
She was beautiful.
I still can't believe it Paul -- that you wouldn't say a word in your own defense.
I tell you he hasn't and he wouldn't dare use it if he had.
We're all in it.  There won't be a shred of pride or decency left for any of use.  Say something, Paul!  You've always been good with words.  Put some together, now, and tell us that you're not responsible -- that every damnable bit of it doesn't rest squarely on your shoulders!
Well, it's the funniest thing. I've been talking to some investors -- a little outside venture, you understand, between you and me -- about a scheme to manufacture a new Styrofoam packaging. Little peanut like pieces that can really keep an item free from trauma during shipping. Miraculous. Anyway, it turns out the genius behind the whole project is your neighbor, Jim Williams. How about that!
Good night.
What do you think?
So early?
You think I --
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
So how's school treating you?
Hnnn.
About?
Sure dad.
See you.
After the Thanksgiving I had, I need it. You having one?
Oh jeez, Benjie. Well, here you are.
Fascist!
Actually it's not about work, it's advice about --
But what?
What?
Good shit.
It's what?
Thank you Janey.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
It's not a bother.
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
Social work?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Yes.
In many ways, the church-bound tradition of the father, son, and holy ghost is simply a version of the parent-child-adult triad within us all. It's a primitive set of symbols for our inner psychology.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
See ya.
Flame on, asshole.
How can you do that man?
Major.
Everything's gonna freeze, the big freeze.
Come on Paulie, share the wealth. You copped 'em from her mom's stash anyway.
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
Stupid!  Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend?
Huh?
You're parents at that party?
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
I have not touched your sh--  Stuff. You watching this?
Hello, Charles.
How are the parental units functioning these days?
Is this Charles?
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Want a drink?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
I don't know. How do I know?
Detective Dormer's not leaving for a few hours.
Good.
Just after Leland Street.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
I had him!
I want you to check this out, Ellie.
Who's that?
Oh, you know.  Don't feel that much. Bullet went right through.
Who was the last one to see her alive?
I'll stick it in the evidence locker...
What?
Eight years.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You heard me that time.
Ran like hell to go to him...
Since grade school.
My arm!
Kay Connell had a signed copy of one of your books.
Down at the station?
No.
Doesn't sound like a mentor to me.
I thought maybe we could talk some more.
No back-up.
Surely you know the one who made you...
My God... So it's as I always feared. Nothing, leading to nothing.
I'm not innocent. But I'm afraid. She feels she's in danger from the others.
That's what the one who made me said.
Louis, they cannot be brought back. There are some things that are impossible, even for me.
You were their leader. They trusted you.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Oh, Claudia, you've outdone yourself. Where did you find them?
You want me to be a doll forever?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
That's not so.
Yes...
How do you mean, start?
Did I hear a yes?
And if I don't?
I learnt absolutely nothing. I wasn't give a choice, remember?
NO!!!
Is God merciless? Greedy and cruel?
Your mama's left you with us. She wants you to be happy.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
But I thought vampires didn't like the light.
Peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? Bull shit. But one of our kind? Not a whisper.
Yes.
You're in 201 and 202.
It sure is a beautiful old hotel.
Storm season?
Stupid. Stupid.
I thought you were out of town!
Don't even think about it.
No.
There's no way to lock it.
Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry.
Ray...what are you doing?
Voodoo.
I'm trying. I really am...Sometimes I don't even know why I came up here in the first place.
What?
I scared you -- I crossed the line --
Pretty cool bar.
Somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
Maybe we should just wait here? Hide in a tree?
Why? He can't help us.
Hell, that's worth three, easy. And you got your waiting period.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
I wonder if my editor's psychic? Reports from the Greek front are going to be a little vague.
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
I'm not sure that it is the plague.
Poor child. These must be horrible days for you.
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
Cathy —- how does it feel to have a father?
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
This is Dr. Drossos, chief medical officer of my division.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
She's not too well.
You know that sound, Oliver?
There's no one there -— nothing but the caves and the dead.
You are a happy man Oliver. You have but one world to live in —- the world of today. I have two worlds. I have that old dark world of peasant ignorance and superstition in which I was brought up and a new world which the army gave me —— a world of mathematics, gun ranges,logistics, tactics, strategy.
I had a notion you had become self—appointed chaperone lately — why?
And I'm your friend —— but that doesn't explain why you are always trying to come between Thea and me?
Come —- you'll feel yourself again as soon as we get off this dismal island.
Hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen!  It's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
Oh, no.
I told you –– I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
Who is it?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Bert, the cop, sent this over. He said to float away to Happy Land on the bubbles.
Looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Goodbye, everybody!
I'm all right.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Came back three days ago.
Kind that will help you find the answers, George.
Well, she's not crazy about him.
Well then, how do you know?
Is it a charge, sir?
You want a martini?
That does it! Out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
I thought when we put him on the Board of Directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
This town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to Potter. You've got talent, son. You get yourself an education. Then get out of here.
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Nothing.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
No, George, don't . . .
Some other time, George.
Hello.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
When?
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Would I?  You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
I don't like coconuts.
Well, I don't.
Me?
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
Hi.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
Someone pop your balloon?
Get on the rocks!
I don't know.
You coming up on him?
Hey!
What is it?  What's there?
Chief....
In here.
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
No place special.  Just hanging out.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
Because.
Dad, I'm sorry....
You don't make enough.
That's it.
Sound?
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
Where's my day book?
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
I'll give notice.
What is it?  What's the matter?
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
A tragedy.  But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
Thank God you guys were all together. I got something for you.  Proof!
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
That's what I'd like to know.  Lost transmission at Cable Junction.
Then nothing.  If you see him, tell him to switch to an operational frequency, or give me a status report yourself.
Did you say Cable Junction?
When?
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hang on!
I told you, remember?
You're not going out right away, are you?
But first, a little juice....
That you'll put down a blanket.  I've got black and blue marks all over my butt, and my Mom's getting uptight about them.
Mike?  Our Mike?
How much longer?
No way.  Everybody's going sailing. If you don't want to take me, just say so.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
Who wouldn't.
Do I have to play with the little kids?
So?  So?
We're ready for you.
Absolutely.  Good idea.
Well, don't worry about your fiancee.  We'll watch over her.
Damn it.  I can't understand!  I gotta go, hon.
Yeah.
That macho pompous English --
Honey, I gotta go.
I don't know.  I can't understand it.  Something's bothering them.
They're coming with us?
Baby goddamn scared me to death!
Up.
Make up your mind.
You want me to stay?
You don't.
Okay.
... Mean through the tubes?
I did.  He wants it on exhibit.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
How is he?
I am.  You're not.
Are you okay?
I don't know.  They're nervous and skittish right now.
Okay now.  Have Flipper flip or something.
I can have them walk backwards.
Sharks are man-biters, Mister Hutton.  Not man-eaters --
I've handled sharks before. Bigger than this one.
So do I.  But for different reasons.
We're all from the sea, Mr. Hutton. Our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  By continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
She, Mister Hutton.
Give me a ride?
Musclehead?
Sure.  No problem.
Sean.  Sean, where are you?
Hi, Mike.
Depends on big brother.
Herpes?
Sean, this is ridiculous.  You're acting very immature.
Take it up!
Now what?
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
Hey, I don't want to hear.
Buzz off.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Oh...
Hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
Got a job for me?
Great.  I got one B, two C's, and eight incompletes.
How is he?  Still fighting crime?
Big bust!  He confiscate their water pistols?
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
Gee, it's good to see you!
We're in love.
He was such a good-natured kid... Always going out of his way....
She calls it, 'Tourist On The Loose.' Local government commissioned it. For the public beach....
Make a list.
We don't have anything straightened out.  You're uptight about something ...what's wrong?
I can't help it....
Serves you right.  Will you please stop....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I almost forgot....
Come on, Mom, you can't be serious....
Mom, please don't start that again....
It's not easy.  None of it is.  I have to find some way to get on with my life and I'm going to try.  I finally figured that out.  I'm going to do my best....
Trying to write our report....
You look tired....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
I want you all to come to Amity this summer.
It could have been an accident....
I'm not saying you're wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
I don't know how....
Where do I pull off...?
I'm only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
No, you're not....
A big one....
You're always taking time off....
Yes I can....
Mind if I cut in?  Your date's lonely....
We'll be done pretty soon....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
We're being paid to see where they go...How they propagate....
I made them, man....
Sharp shirt, Jake....
They put bombs on dolphins....
Oh, it's okay for you, but not for me....
Half don't...Bring her about....
I'm coming...How close is it?
How come only me?
Holy Christ....
Your equipment has crapped out again....
How much longer?  This is supposed to be your party.
Is it your vehicle?
We give it one more hour. Did the photographer do the dogs?
Not for me ..
What time is it?
There's nothing in the files?
I <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
Why don't you dump it? Mail it off. Give the fucking F.B.I. a present?
O.K. and I'm not in love with this fukker? That's how I feel about him.
This looks promising .. I think this one could be it?
Alright, I didn't, but I nearly did, and if I had I'd have been right .. I knew there was some- thing about that Labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. We gotta get back up that dump ..
Maybe not? I'm feeling lucky ..
Stop it.
Sure.
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Nothing you gotta say do I wanna hear right now. So save yourself saying it.
Everything you say sounds reason- able. But there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
What if we need a back up?
Alright. I'll start at the top, and work down.
I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Alright, gentlemen, I'm gonna leave you. I got a couple of questions for the paper, Serg- eant? Mind if I swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
.. feel like I'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like I'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. I'm sorry, King J ..
I may have said some- thing. I don't recall.
Don't you know nothing about this guy? He <u>reads</u> the newspapers. Col- lects the cuttings. When are they gonna find her? Now he's reading Helena Robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. You couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
As recent as we have .. What ex- actly is your interest in Amber?
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
What d'you wanna ask, Mr Ross?
She has an aunt, in Vermont. I'll take her there tonight.
He doesn't need my help.
You got a warrant for this?
When did John divorce?
What does that mean?
So tonight she confesses?
Hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
Shut up, King Jay ..
He has? .. What's he doing here?
Where do you fit in, Trimble?
Ugh!
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
Look, I don't want a --
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
He's asleep, right?
Airight.  Enough.  I'm pulling him out of this.  This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Can I help?
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
You think so?
That took guts.
Hello?
We are?
Oh my God.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Yeah, I did.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
Yeah, what happened there.
I'm relieved you said that.
Oh good.
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Forgot your keys --
Call me tomorrow.
That's your word?
You're telling me to dance.
Won't happen.  I'm strong in my mind.
No, I don't know.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
Why not --
Jerry Maguire.  SMI.
And I can't say his name without laughing I want to eat him up. I want to say goodbye to every bad thought I ever had about relationships.  I mean, I crave this guy... and yet... why... why did I have that affair this weekend?  Does that mean I'm not in love with my boyfriend?
Gorgeous.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
I won't tell.
Can you be quiet?
He should have kept his head tucked down.
Oh, my God.
Well we should split up or something. We can cover twice the area.
It's not safe.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
You mean it?
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
So Mr. Kirby, tell me, when you climbed K2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
Raptors, mostly.
Which one do you prefer?
A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
We climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. With any luck, the Costa Rican coast guard will pick us up.
Do you have any kids?
I have never been on this island!
That cheap aftershave I send you every Christmas, you actually wear it.  I'm touched.  Sit down, sit down, what brings you to Mombassa?
I didn't know you -- weren't well.
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
Isla Nublar was just a showroom, Ian, something for the tourists, Site B was the factory floor.  We built it first, on Isla Sorna, eight-some miles from Nublar.
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
Where's the power and radio setup?
I didn't tell anything, I told the truth.
Their what?
No way.
No.
Come on!
They will come after me.  But I can collect some stool samples, for DNA with that, Nick's tapes, and the rest of you to back me up, it should stand when we get back.
Women.  'Bout eighty percent female in Greenpeace.
Oh, please.  How am I supposed to keep a straight face when --  -- Johnny Cash here tells me I'm going to Skull Island?
He doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.
If we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.
I will not do it.  You'll have to get somebody else, because I will not.
Are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? I mean, what's hanging us up?
Are you sure?
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
But with this place, I - - I wanted to give  them something real, something that wasn't an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  An aim devoid of  merit.
This is just a delay, that's all this is.  All major theme parks have had delays.  When they opened Disneyland in 1956, nothing worked, nothing.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
The what?
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
- - the undigested state of the berries because it's - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - barfs them up - -
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
And scary.
Alan, listen to this.
Dino droppings?
Seven days?!  Seven days?!  Oh, great.  Oh good - - clever.
Up and down, up and down!
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
Yeah.
And we can charge anything we want!  Two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  And then there's the merchandising - -
Hey!  Where are the brakes?
Because they sure don't look like birds to me.  I heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in Mexico - -
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
These look kind of familiar.
It's just like coming out of a tree house.  Did your dad ever build you a tree house, Tim, eh?
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
You got me.
Come on, try some.  Take a bite.
It's a bit of a climb.  You guys think you can make it?
Are you crazy?  What if you miss?  I hate it up here.
You got any kids?
Well, I didn't ask.  Why wouldn't they be?
I, uh, don't really know any.  We - -
No, I'm sorry, that  wouldn't be possible.  We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
You four are going to have a little company out in the park.  Spend a little time with our target audience. Maybe they'll help you get the spirit of this place.
Dad - - Dad - -
I like cows.
Let's go!
What works?
I don't blame people for their mistakes, but I do ask that they pay for them.
I'll keep an eye on it.  Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.
Sustain winds 45 knots.
Thanks for the presents.
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
Why did you do this?
They're not monsters, Lex. They're just animals.  And these are herbivores.
Janet, goddamnit, what's going on?
I thought that was Ted Bundy.
Who's chest?
Are you going to plead insanity?
Sorry.
Oh?
Nurses. That's why I went into medicine.
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
What do you want -- a tidy psychological profile? You want to hear that I was falsely accused of a crime I didn't commit... and that's driven me to defend others? Or maybe you want to me to get in touch with my feelings... talk about my childhood...
Oh?
The mother said the boy hadn't slept for over three _months_. A physical examination showed dilated pupils, temperature of one-oh-two, blood chemistry highly imbalanced...
Simple. We sedate him, induce a somnolesent state, and study his REM patterns when he's unconscious.  If he has the disorder, his REMS will be highly abnormal. Ruby smiles.
I thought you said Krueger burned to death.
Not yet.
I'll have to lean on them pretty hard after what happened last night... but I think I can do it.  Let me know what happens.
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
Krueger's in the real world... maybe he's mortal, like us.
What is it really?
Just what you've published.
Gabriela was right -- it's easier for me to understand suicide. I'm a practicing suicide.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
You work in the cemetery.
If I don't see you later -- go to my house and find my notebooks -- and destroy them.  All my manuscripts -- just burn them. Please.
I gave it to him yesterday.
Not today, Burgel.  Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
Excuse me, sir -- I understand you have Eduard Raban's file.
Hello again.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Tonight?
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
Now you're saying Eduard was lured there?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
Or what if there really <u>was</u> an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it?  One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
This is the result of their elixir of youth.  They were to come and check on it during the night.  I contrived to miss the appointment.
Kafka -- is that your real name?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Your office is the Workmen's --
Engaged in the manufacture and distribution of ... pills and so forth.
I don't think he really had any. He had no family either.
-- Just doing our job.
I believe we've exceeded his expectations.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
They keep switching us from department to department.  He doesn't mind because he can't sit still.
We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
Am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.Ladies and gentlemen! I am touching the beast!
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Barricade the gates! Quick!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
We offer ourselves at your service, Mr Denham!
Tell me Mr Ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Why?
Please, if he sees you, he won't come!
Oh you've got to. He does such fun things with imagery. And I've been reading The Fall --  -- The Fall by Ahlbair Camoo -- it's the same thing, you know the imagery --
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Sure dear, yes.
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
No, that's not --
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
-- We can talk --
Yes.
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
What is it?
Honest?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
No, I'm look --
-- Tuscarora --
You remind me of my uncle.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
No.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
Is there anything more I could --
What're you gonna do next?
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Not much point to this, is there?
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
Mm.
About what?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
Well there's a couple --
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
What's in it?
Then how are you involved?
No.
But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get you hired to look for Grunemann?
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
What else do you know?
Nobody's seen that.
We'd expect him to work in cooperation with you. He'd report to each of you and to our Company's New York office, to Pete -- Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth, and --
The prospect of losing my child.
What do you have here, Billy?
Greatest.
C'mon, there's not much difference--
No I didn't.  I hate the brown stuff.  It's gross.
I'm allergic to onions.
Owwww...You're hurting me... You're hurting me...I hate you ...I hate you...
Daddy?
Now go to sleep.  It's very late.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.
Is that really your chair?
No, she never did.
Are you going to remarried Phyllis?
Uh, uh.  There was no such a thing as Burger King.
Why does he decide?
What don't you understand, pal?
Objection!
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
Because my son is here.  And his father is here.  As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult?
And did you have a close personal relationship?
There might be something at J. Walter Thompson.  But...  ...I don't think they're really serious.  The position's been open for two months and...  They may just be on a fishing expedition.  I'm sure you'll be much happier if you wait until after the first--
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way?
I don't recall.
Somewhere in between.
Is that...permanent?
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry.
Joanna, I don't give a--
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing.  I never thought he'd use it.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
How should I know?
Right.
What?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
Three months.  How can you tell?
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot.  So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
No, but--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
Lenox Hill.  77th Street between Park and Lex.  The emergency number is 327-0800.
D'you think you and Charley'll ever get back together again?
Uh, huh...Yeah...
Sure.
Ted.
Yes, Holiness.
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
I do, now.
Can I free the prisoners?
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Of the Tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
And the United Nations? Surely?
Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
Yes. A cow had died. One night, you stopped all your moving, and I said to your sister, "His time has come."
How many?
Roughly five thousand men.
What was the warning of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
The war is over. This is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
Can India help us?
Britain chooses not to.
We are traveling to Lhasa. May we...?
I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
The Chinese.
These are dangerous times. They want the Dalai Lama to lead them.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
We cannot.
Completely.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
Well, you've got a croc alright, they're keystone species.
What are <u>you</u> doing?!
Is this a trick?
His head was just... bitten off.
This is a setback.
Where is he?!
Let's not overlook he didn't eat me, maybe--
Thirty meters or so.  Moving slow, but straight toward Elsie.
Thank you, Jack.
You take care.
Such the flirt.
You <u>should</u> take a flax pole.
Are you sure?
With crocodiles... everything's even.
I'm an empty man, Kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, I sit here broken, a hollow sack--
Didn't even <u>sound</u> good?
The Museum of Natural History doesn't send out investigators to--
So I don't like tents, why--
Excuse me?
Why he's that <u>big</u>, I don't know. Why he's <u>here</u>... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  Australia, Fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
Just gotta pull it a little tighter.
So I was thinking... maybe if I met anybody in <u>my</u> world who was good for <u>you</u> and if you know somebody in New York good for me, we could fix each other up.
Well.  At wakes.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
And that's why he thinks they're Godly?
You think Jack's handsome?
What?
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
Hi.  Listen.  Could I steal you a second?
I know and I thought I could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it's a dangerous mix.
The somebody else part?
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
This is business.  There was an accident in Maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  Probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
I'm not going to Maine, I won't even go west of Forty-third Street--
Really?  I never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there's somebody else?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
Myra.
Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it?
Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient...
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
But then he had to cover up, make her seem just like all the rest of them. That's what Lecter was hinting!
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Talk about him, Starling. Tell me what you see.
When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit.
You seem pretty sure of that.
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
He offered to help, Starling, not to snitch. That wouldn't give him enough chance to show off. Remember, Lecter looks mainly for fun. Never forget fun.
Starling -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Sewing...
No way. She had a guy, I'da known, believe me. Sewing was her life, she was really great at it. Poor Freddie.
Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me?
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you?
And the questionnaire...?
How did -  It's nothing. A scratch.
Why don't you tell me about "Miss Mofet?" You wanted me to find him. Or do I have to wait for the lab?
Who can say...? Best thing for him, really. His therapy was going nowhere.
Ahhh... Why?
Do you have something you use, when you need to get up your courage? Memories, tableaux... scenes from your early life?
Who killed Raspail, Doctor...? You know, don't you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
Big through the hips. Roomy.
Was it a butterfly?
Dr. Lecter, there's no correlation in the literature between transsexualism and violence. Transsexuals are very passive.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
I didn't get more than a few miles before the sheriff's car found me. The rancher was so angry he sent me to live at the Lutheran orphanage in Bozeman. I never saw the ranch again...
Brave Clarice. Will you let me know if ever the lambs stop screaming?
Starling.
I have no plans to call on you, Clarice, the world being more interesting with you in it. Be sure you extend me the same courtesy.
Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin.
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Because what I am interested in is right here...
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
The man encouraged the colonials to desert in this very room, in my presence. He is guilty of sedition and must be tried and hanged like any other criminal, regardless of what he did for my children.
Some say that's the way of it.
Will you consider that?
We were headed...
I owe you gratitude or I'd call you out!
Any powder?
A French & Indian army out of Fort Carillon's heading south to war against the English. I'm here to raise this county's militia to aid the British defense.
That reason wear a blue dress and work in the surgery?
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
Ambush... on the George Road. This Magua led us into it.  ...eighteen killed. It's these men who saved us. They guided us here...
What a place for them...
I understand. This is not good place to stop.  Two leagues from here. No water 'til then.  That where we stop. Better place.
Wampum?
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Gold could be arranged.
Yes.
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
Nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!
My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
My son Magua's pain is my pain.
Here.  Put this on.  You examine him.
I don't know.  I've been back and forth with Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
It could be a million things, something in the air, food....  But he went on that ship and so did Williams...  I want to examine the crew.
I've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
No!
They know, don't they?
How much time does that give us?
What about our quota?
I'm going inside.
Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium and 15 tons of Sodium.
I know that.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
What're you saying?  That we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
Forty-eight hours!
Not yet.
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
It...almost got you.
Still bothering you?
Getting some food.
Excuse me, sir...Bowman's sick.  She's downstairs in the infirmary.
The monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
Who were you talking to?
Sixpack...
The shack...
So how long do you have to wait 'till you see a return?
Is there something we should know about you, Soap?
Drachmas, I hope. I would feel safer with a chicken drumstick. They could do more harm than good.
Yes?
A cocktail, you asked for a cocktail.
Like what?
You get the guns?
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Well you just better un-sell 'em, sharpish.
All right, all right, so we can say he is good.
Er, very nice Harry. What's it for?
Mind your language in front of my boy.
You all right back there, mate?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
What is the point in that? Even if it was a bug they would have taken it with 'em.
Out the back.
Well, what do you want us to do about it?
Guns! You never said anything about guns. A minute ago this was the safest job in the world, now it's turning in to a bad day in Bosnia . . .
What do you mean?
What the hell are you doing here?
Why, what's up?
That's if I want to see you.
Yes?
Not normal weed. This is some fucked-up skunk class A. I can't think let alone move shit.
Jews don't celebrate Christmas, Tom.
Of course you will look mean, Tom, you will look really scary.
Oh, you assume, do ya? What do they say about assumption being the brother of all fuck-ups?
Where did you get those from, a museum?
I can't take any more school.
--you're going to be on your own.
And what did she do?
Do whatever they tell you--
Why don't you start with that?
You're dismissed.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
I hear they're closing that post down.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
He swore by it.  What?
Whole different story; isn't it?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora.
I never met her.
I'm a colonel.
Same as they done in Mexico.
That guy who got shot--
My father says the day you're  born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
Are we going to ever see your father?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
Something like that.
It's a lead mine.
It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas--
Cliff--
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
So where does that put us?
Seriously.
Now I'm just as liberal as the next guy--
--but just as a kind of safety tip.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
This is an official visit, then--
I gonna meet that family of yours?
Hola, amgio. Problemas de llanta? [Hey, friend. Tire problems?]
I haven't seen anybody doing that.
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
You thought any more about our murder?
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
The Perdido thing?
Steve?
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
Well, you hire illegals--
He was killed.
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
You gonna stay out here?
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
People liked him.
Yeah?
Wow.
How long have you lived here?
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
We start from scratch--
Yeah--
Sam? I--the Committee--you know Jorge and H.L. and all--they asked me--
Just doing my job.
How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much.
Another woman?
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
I sent your Daddy to the farm once.
You going to tell her?
I gotta be careful.  If Vinovich sees me talking to you.  He's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
They go together.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You heard right.
My life was too weird for her.
I mean, there's no instructions--  What do you mean, they're not tricks?
Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time.
You did.  Didn't you?
About?
Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free.
I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
He's a secretive man.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
I can be very persuasive.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
Oh Christ.
What then?
What was that?
I'm here, Harry.
Don't look.
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
Are you finished with me?
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
They weren't worth a damn.
Whose is the car?
You know of him?
I like to know why things happen.
I'm afraid she's not in.
Leave her alone --
Are you satisfied now?
You rigged the illusion to fail, right?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
She has no real grip on reality.
Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together.
You need an ambulance.
What?
The Puritan?
Where'd you learn that?
Have you been in?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
No.  At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit...
They got here before us.
Nobody's better off this wav!
The case is closed. Harry. Tapert's given us a full confession.  Get your ass back to Mew York.
I got to go.  I'm late.
I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg.
Because you've got nothing else to live for.
So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
What do you do?
Hi again, how's it going?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
Hello?
Charlotte, who?
You think so?
Do you know where we are?
When are you leaving?
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Hello, darling.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
Hi, Lydia.
Fine.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
When are you coming home?
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Oh, the record company sent these...
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... It's soo good to see you. How long are you here for?
Uh...sure...I...what?
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Must be a spare set.
Nonsense, it's all of our home.  So how's work treating you?
Quiet.  Real quiet...
George, come in.  What the hell happened to you?
Mr. Kelson, what a pleasure to meet you. I have to say your instincts about the criminally insane are impeccable.  I am a fan.
No, I wasn't, actually.
I don't mean to belittle you, but we've been through this before.  Satan is not what you think he is.  Satan is not some creature.
Something he said, just before...
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
Um hm.  That's right, Maya.
What's his name?
Peter...Peter Kelson.
Two negatives always make a positive.
Not pure evil.  That's correct.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power.  Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
So what?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
We needed to know all we could.
What do you mean?
No oxygen to the brain.
Maybe that's my problem.
What can I do?
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
A lot of good that'll do.
You don't want to face it.
You do know, don't you.  That these are also numbers.  Greek numbers, 600, 60 and 6 - or 666.  The sign of the Devil.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
You know what they say.  You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Would you sign it for me?
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
She told me she killed them.
Taste this.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
What?
Need any help?
So what do I do?
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
I'm so sorry.  No one would switch flights with me.
It means a lot that you came by.
A horse?
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Too many times.
They ever love you back?
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
I know.
What's that?
For real?
I don't care.
I don't like flowers.
I want to ride my own bike.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
What's that?
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
Would you watch the damn road?
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Yeah.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
You do see me standing here, right?
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
So how about a little one-on-one?
Kiss my booty.
I...can't.
Why not?
he's just playing, Q...
Who's nobody?
What the hell's going on?
We're going to get some food.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
What?
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Darryl.  He's alright, kinda corny.
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
You haven't changed.  You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  Well, guess what, it doesn't.
Better late than never, right?
I'll play you.
Give it yourself.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Where's your dad?
This is just about money, you know that.
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
You know, people.
What?
So what are you gonna do?
Your door was unlocked.
What do you want?
You want me to fuck off?
Call 911. Call 911 right now.
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Hello?
Hi, hello, great.  This is Seduce and Destroy?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
Well I'm not sure why you're calling me.
Brain and Lung.
My mother had breast cancer.
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
I'M NOT CRAZY.  Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
I'M NOT CRAZY.  You're the one.  You're the one who's wrong.  You're the one --
OPEN THE DOOR.
Yes.
Wilson.
Was it a boyfriend of yours?
Bit messy.
It's where situations like these lead, Claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  Now there are certain measures you can take --
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
If you're not here for a 422 --
You wanna go on a date with me?
Billingsley's?
I've got troubles.
I want a shot of tequila too.
Can you hold it?
What do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
GIVE US YOUR MONEY, KID.
I - just - thought - that - I - didn't want - I - didn't - I - didn't -
No.
What happend?
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Well --
And I'm listening avidly, fellow.
"The" cause of dullness in others --
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
You mind your own bussines.
Gently, son --
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
If you're happy with Phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact Hospice to arrange for the body --
Do you wanna sit down?
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
...cocksucker....
You wanna call him on the phone? We can call him, I can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
This is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
Is this 509-9027?
Yes.
In aid of what?
I'm sorry.
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
From '84 to '89.
Where does that name come from?
Oh, yeah.  No, no, no.  They wouldn't --
Hello.  Frank.  Frank TJ Mackey.
Is Linda here?
He's in here.
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
.....have you ever seen this..I mean, never mind, you said --
I'm really sorry.
So....Phil....um...I think I'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...I mean:
I'm here.  I'm here now.  What do you want? Do you want anything?
You can't just come in here.
Calm down.
I AM CALM.
You're here.
I live alone.
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
I didn't do anything.
Bad and illegal behavior. That's what I mean. Ok?  Mischief.  Now have you been doin' some drugs today?
No. No. Stay down, Marcie, sit back down on that couch --
This is the LAPD. If anyone is back here I want you to come out and I want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
Marcie - quiet down! Now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
Did your wife find out?
Then what?
You want her right now?
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
As fast as I can.
I went to see her -- some fuckin' asshole answers the door in his underwear, he's fifty years old, there's coke and shit laid out on the table --
-- did she talk to you?
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
You're Jimmy Gator, right?
Do you still have to do homework?
Was it a call back?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Partridge?
Yeah.
I don't have regular classes anymore.
We need more dog food --
Alright.
Hi.
..sorry...
....you have it...easy....you know? You have a father who loves you, huh?
I understand you saved my son's life today.
God smiled upon us.
M'lady... if anyone sees, it is death...
I have never seen a sight more beautiful than you, tonight.
Mother -- ?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
He is your brother!
Your birthday celebration, your Majesty?
Well... perhaps you should speak with them, your Majesty.
Perhaps you can find out who this secret leader of the Jesuits is. You are now a priest, but you were once a Musketeer, serving the throne of France, a throne ordained of God. Can you accept this mission, and keep it private?
Your Majesty...
And some problems cannot be settled without one.
You are bitter, Athos.  You are torn by grief, not only for Raoul, but for d'Artagnan, whom you love, and now treat as an enemy.
He who is not with us is against us.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Go on.
But -- what is he doing?
He's threatened to do it, it's been building up in him for months.
Remember, Phillippe... nobility is born in the heart.
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Pull them back, d'Artagnan.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Where are we?
It is also a place of burial.
It is a weighty problem, Aramis -- but perhaps you should leave it to this secret General of the Jesuits, whoever he might be.
I remember that night.  D'Artagnan was drunk, the only time I've seen him that way.  The three of us were reveling, remember, Athos?
Not just a baby, Porthos.  I carried the child of the king.
Coming?
So was Mary Magdalene, and our Lord loved her.
Who?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
That must be Raoul!  Raoul!  Look, d'Artagnan's come to visit...! What's wrong?  You look awful!
Thanks, but not for me.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
I know.
An oath is an oath precisely because it cannot be removed!
You look so sad.  Is it something I have done?
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then there is one more thing, of an even more personal nature.
At least help Raoul.
Silence!  I order you!
Your Majesty.  This ball, with an open invitation to the nobility of Paris -- we have no way of checking --
Phillippe!
Eh?
Yes, yes, go on.
I... we are humble people...
Your department contacted our agency regarding information on Sarah Williams.
Our agency monitors all threats very carefully, and there's good reason to believe Jim Trudell has the training, the connections, and the experience to present a clear threat to the public if he remains at large.
Every step of the way.
These crowds are going to make it a bitch!
Did you start out area six?
I tell you one thing Trudell - you'd make a hell of a cop...
Did he harm the girl?
Now you listen to me hay-seed! If you don't want to spend a year in jail for making a false report you'll start giving me straight answers, you got that!!
Her prints belong to Stephanie Field, convicted for soliciting two years ago.
He said he was following up some lead.
You always carry a gun with you?
I was there, and it was no suicide. He was killed by professionals.  I was in the bathroom when it happened.
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
There's something I've been meaning to ask you, Stephanie.
They're inside the department, they're everywhere - it's not safe.
1490...Breckinridge...
I knew I could count on you.
OK...Marvosa makes calls to this fax number overseas.  And that's Switzerland's country code.
Who knows?  Maybe he's ordering army knives. I can't access that, but look what we have here...these are the account records for Fleming and Marvosa.
I can't help you anymore, Jimmy. I'm sorry.
Well I've kind of had my fill of the place, you know what I mean?
Where did you learn to fight like that? JIM  I read a book.
Ditched you?
Did you have sex with her?
Don't you guys ever knock?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
That's probably in the part Lecktor tore out.  At the top it says: 'I hope we can correspond.' And then the hole begins.  It looks like Lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
Nobody's better with evidence. But he has the other thing, too. He doesn't like that part of it...
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
You said the guy down here is good.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
You can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger print...
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
Tell me now.
He's very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  If we find out how he finds them, then we'll find him.
It's the guard in the storeroom.
Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
Get the roadblocks set on Route Three! There's an access road to the back of the house. That ought to be a second team's approach.  Will Graham and I are in an orchard due west of the house.
I'll cover the back.
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock.
Thanks, but I'll take the bus. I do it all the time.
I'll probably go back to it someday.
I'll get my purse.
No.
Are you cold? Would you like a blanket?
Do you feel privileged?
No. I don't want to see you.
Not me.
In a holding cell.
Now I'll bet it has his home address there, too
This is Will Graham. Can I help you?
Do you know something about that?
He's misunderstood.
I don't want to do that,
Why do you think he took his gloves off?
He only bit women so far, right?
I call him a monster.
Will you be in Atlanta for a while? I'm not buggin' you about coming home, I just wondered.
Can you quit?
I have to go back to Birmingham.
Not too bad. I'll be here a few days longer.  I want to see you.
Sure he is. Blond.  Probably Scandinavian, too...
Lt. Fisk said...
Are you George Sherman?
My name's Will Graham. I...
How many turtle eggs you think are in here?
I told my dad before he died, I'd take care of Mom. And I'll do it.  This guy wants to kill you?
How did it happen?
Why should I tell you?
Chilton? Gruesome, isn't he? He fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  He actually tries to give me a Thematic and Apperception test. Hah. Sat there waiting for MF-13 to come up. It's a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  I was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. I laughed in his face.  Never mind, it's boring.
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
What disadvantage?
No.
I don't believe in God.
I'm gonna spray your suit jackets. It'll be invisible in this light, but you'll stand out like a zebra for us.  They told me you checked out a .44 Charter Arms Bulldog.
Tank you veddy much.
George, I hate sitcoms.
I refuse.
Of course.  But only on Monday nights.
Hi, Andy.  How's the weather up there?
They're having a laugh...
Hey!  Our first phone call!  Hello?
No, it's true.  I have lung cancer.
I can't move my arm.
Did your -- doctor say it's okay for you to go back to work?
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
Maybe I should talk to the natives.  Shoom boom boo ba!  Shoom boom boo ba --
Andy!
B-but... we saw... your neck...
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
You don't know the real me.
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
Go to commercial, man!  Get off the stage!
GET OFF!
She'll say, "Now my son is a man."
It's a rave!  Boy, if I ever fake my death, they'll really miss me.
This is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you didn't attend the retreat.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I know!  Wink wink!  Nudge nudge!
Get off my stage!  You're fired!
Can I help you with something?
I saw Michael!
Lieutenant?
Weird.
You are a beautiful woman.  Too bad things had to work out like this.
... yes.
What are you doing?
Five.  Since I've been here.
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
Are they any agent?
No!  It's too far away.
No way, no way, this is crazy.
What do you know?
The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window or on your television.  You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
This can't be...
Right now, we're inside a computer program?
Yes.
What do you believe in?
That's why we're here.
Faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  These things are not a matter of cause and effect, Neo. I do not believe things with my mind.  I believe them with my heart. In my gut.
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
We need an exit.
Hello?
Yeah.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
But you already know what I'm going to tell you.
I'm not the One.
Trinity?  The Trinity?  The Trinity that cracked the I.R.S. Kansas City D-Base?
Right now, all I can tell you, is that you are in danger.  I brought you here to warn you.
What the hell is this?!
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
That's different.
Is it?
What did she tell you?
What happened?
No, you... have to be.
What?
Do what?
No.
Zion?
How?
Goddamnit!  I don't believe this is happening!
Cypher, I thought --
Whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
Well the guy over there said...
Can't we come with you?
Really wanted to get a little tiger Charlie, y'know...a little William Blake and all that...
It's an open ticket.  I can go anywhere up to $350.
Sure.  And you're gonna take the vows next Tuesday, right.
It's the truth, I swear.
Nah.
Yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
You're not supposed to like it. What gets me is your attitude. Listen... tomorrow you show up.
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
Ok, ok...take it easy.  I'll show. Tuesday I'll give Michael something. I promise.
Take it.  I'm doing it for you, stupid!
No, I just want to help myself, that's all.
Don't you move!!!
Don't ask...do you have any idea what I've been doing all morning...eh?
I was in the basement fixing the pipes.  Would you believe that?
Disgraceful.
'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
Diane, how are you feeling?
Stripper?
Hostess?
Teresa.
What was it?
"Francis Macomber."
What is it now?
It was nothing.  I'm almost finished.
...He must have heard the name from those T.V.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  I remember GUEVARA was in town at the time. Must've heard it from there I guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
Charlie...I've got to see you.  I want to talk...
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
Come on.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Look who's talking.
Daddy!
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart.  I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
Who?
Conflict, honey.  Korean Conflict.
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
Good, good.  Glad to hear it.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
Sounds good.
I'm all excited --
Like a marriage made in heaven?
What do you mean?
Sit down, Drew.
Mind if I throw up?
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear.  Now they want to do the same with theirs.
What are their feelings?
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Certainly, Bill.
Thanks, Quince.
We'll do it together.  I'll clue you in.  Timing's got to be right.  The old man says it's up to Joe.
Yeah, that's what he said.
I'd like to come, too.  See Susan strut her stuff.
He was interested.
The timing -- yes.  He says it's up to Joe.
You wait here'n to take us?  Like you bus driver to dere?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Jennifer.
Yes?
You love Allison, don't you?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
'Big'?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
Where are you going?
'To bed'?
Thank you.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Did you like making love to me?
I loved it.
I love you now, I'll love you always --
You think so?
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
And - uh - I  guess, 'goodnight'.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
I'm not everybody.
Excellent.  What is it?
Dinner?  Absolutely.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Okay.  Goodnight.
Well, you goddam well should.  You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
You're violating the laws of the universe.
And I don't give a shit.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Say again?
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry?  Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you.  It's not love --
Which is what?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.  The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity.  I agreed to cooperate.
Time.
Good morning, Quince.
This one.
Drew told me.
Not my birthday again?
You mean like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
A-Okay.  Got my gloves on, my ears pricked.  I'm ready for action.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
You know each other?
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Nothing.
Then what is it?
Where's Joe?
I don't know, I can't say --
I love him.
But what?
Daddy --
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
38.
47.
That's it?
I'm sorry... um... ?
How long have I been here?
No, let's go.
I like your car.
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Please call me Leonard. My wife called me Lenny.
What?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
I know the feel of the world.  I know how this wood will sound when I knock.  I know how this glass will feel when I pick it up.  Certainties. You think it's knowledge, but it's a kind of memory, a kind you take for granted. I can remember so much.  I know the feel of the world,  and I know her.
Kill him.
Who?
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Did you?
No!
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Yes.
I don't know. I'm sorry.
We shouldn't even be talking this way while the case is still open to appeal.
I'm not appealing the decision.
Thank you.
I enjoy it.
This is your car.
Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over.
Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
You don't know him?
Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
How'd ya get him in here in the first place?
Prove it.
Why's that?
What do you mean "bad news"?
Why?
Why?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
He knows you're no good on the phone, so		    * he calls you up to bullshit you.				  * Sometimes you stop taking his calls, so			* he slips something under your door to			  * frighten you into answering your phone			 * again. He's been pretending to help you.		    * Feeding you a line of crap about John G.		    * being some local drug dealer.					*
How do you know this?
He might have fallen down the stairs, I don't know, I don't know what's going on, I'm confused. I have this memory thing - do I know you?
Sammy was a con man. A faker.
Why? You're never going to know.				  *
You won't remember!
Why do you keep lying to me?					 *
Your name's Teddy.
* Thank you.							    *
Quarter mile away.  We see the lights...
Sal Maguda.
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Yes you do...
Okay.  You got the "item"?
I insist.
Died in childbirth, having me...
...'cause we have no future...are of today and not tomorrow.
Like...?
Better than that.  We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can."
Why?
Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them.  So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run...
José...
Packaging?
Alonzo...
And specialize in very fast go-fast boats for coastal runs.
Where?
Verdado.
And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out.
What's the point?  It's going down.
Twenty on my man...
A C.I. we cut loose to your Joint Interagency Task Force.  Name of Alonzo Stevens.  Now, he's YOUR informant.  Stevens, called us.  I haven't spoken to him for six months. I do not know what case you have him on.  I do not know what he is talking about.  But whatever he is doing for you, it sounds like it is going bad.  Right now...
Meet and greet.  "I flash you some of mine, you flash me some of yours?"
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there...
This I gotta see...  ...the "make up an excuse and stop" part.
Yeah.
C'mon, man!
Who are you talking to?
What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...?
You sure?
Yes.  What's up?
Okay.
...the lease, the phones, the cars...layers of false ident. Would take the FBI weeks.  How long did it take them?  Three hours? Four?  This means, "We can reach out and touch somebody."  Like Bad Teleflora.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Why?
This the load you lost a while back?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Alonzo...
Joking? No, ma'am. Oh no! I mean business!
You're not looking for the Statue of Liberty at all.
I can tell, can't you?
You think I'm lying!
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
Gay ends in Y. Fey. You like that -- gay fey -- is that your problem?
You keep the sixty-four cents. I want you to have it.
Hey, you're good! I bet you could pick up a living at this if you tried.
Not bad -- for a cowboy -- you're okay, you're okay.
Yeah.
Sounds like they knew you.
You really want to do business?
Get lost.
Years?
How's your hernia?
Anybody bitten?
Nah, just covered with batshit!
Sixty Lira?
Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not?
He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life.
Where is it?
Yeah!
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
What is it with you man, what the hell is it?
I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Immigration's gonna love you for that.
Yeah...?
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
The kid...
What do you-?
The lights come up, you pull the switch.
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
Please.
Honey, just leave it.
Great crowd.
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Don't touch it.  And for Godsakes, try not to sweat.  They can sense chemical changes...
You guys have done a nice job.  How bout five dollars?
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower.  Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
It bit you.
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
Sure.
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin--  and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer.
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
Well, it's brilliantly written, but then everything you write is brilliant.
The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you.
The phones are working?
I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago.
Thank you so much.
Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan.
I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again.
Annie, in 1871, women often died in childbirth, but her spirit is the important thing, and Misery's spirit is still alive--
You want me to burn my book?
Don't worry about that. You'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.
It's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, Annie.
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
No, just the paper will be fine.
--not fair?
Have to wait.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
Could be the weight of the snow.
What thing?
Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange?
Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne.
Buster.
I thought you were going to dinner.
I suppose I did.
To win?
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Yep.  You've provided us with a golden opportunity to have both the bug and the bug killer.
Ninety-three point four million.
Damn.  Just when it was about to get interesting.
Well you know his blokes'll place the OSCOR in his annex, where else if you're pinpointing transmitters, video signals, covert chip cameras, anything radiating, oscillating..
It is, Billy.
Package away in five..four..three.. two..one...
That's it?  That's it? That's it?
How much longer before you can reach him?
Would you mind if I'm on top?
- this is very disconerting..
Hi.  Would you mind slowing down?
They've got a book for this?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Spoken like a spook..you ever afraid?
What's the population of Seville any idea?
Can you think of a better one?
What wouldn't make him suspicious?
You'll be fine.  I'm going to lose you.
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
-- his left jacket pocket.
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
No.
No.  Should I?
Don't be.  Wouldn't be on vacation if you did.
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
An idea, yeah.
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Whatever Nekhorvich was carrying Sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.
Do you?  Even assuming you're able to prevent Ambrose selling Chimera, you've now got an additional problem.  You destroyed all of Chimera at Biocyte.  If Ambrose is going to sell Chimera now, he'll have to do it by taking a pint or so of Miss Hall's blood to market.
You mean that leaves Miss Hall.
- good.  Then if you manage to get hold of Ambrose, and obtain what he's got, you've got -  - 8 hours 57 minutes and twenty-three seconds to destroy the largest remaining source of Chimera on earth.
Aren't you even curious?  About why she did it?
But you were under specific instructions to bring back a living sample of the Chimera virus.  I'd be very interested to know how, after you'd managed its recovery intact, it subsequently got destroyed.
I'm with an old friend now, Dmitri.
He was quite a man.  Did he know before the end you two had succeeded?
..it seems we have a problem, Dmitri.
Roger that.
Luther, I'm looking at security.
She's on the North Head Bluff - approaching the cliffs.  One klick away.
You have Bellerophon.
Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
<u>Think</u>, for Christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it's gotta be staring us in the face!  What does Ethan Hunt <u>want</u>?!
High speed train.  No-one gets on.  No- one gets off.  High security.  Good place for a pass off to Max.
You knew about Jim?
Krieger.
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
Why haven't they brought us in yet?
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
You're sure about this?
Two cars.  Where are you?
They knew we were coming.  Golitsynís dead too.  The disk is gone.
Yeah.  I follow you.
Certainly Ethan.
Information.
Exactly, that's your job.  Tomorrow on the train, you can't let this list get out into the open.  What's the range of this thing?
Who are you and what are you doing here?
That's the question I want to ask Job.
It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and <u>see</u> if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
What sector's the air conditioning?
Wait!  Hold it - it's on. Let's go.
We'll see.
The package is in the open.
Forty-four.  Forty-five.
He's our guy.
Sure.  If the main character does.
Iíve got a shadow.
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
Whatís going to make him do that?
Jesus, Ethan.  Good for you.
Of course I can hear you.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Jack you're so wicked.
Such a nice ass.
Then, I suppose the time has come say it's been nice Dwight Lionel. It's been everything. Oh, Dwight, I'm frightened.
I don't like him.
Thank you, Rose.
And go to confession.
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
What killed him?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
In a month.
He did?
Yeah.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
What'd you do to your hair?
Oh, Cosmo!
I won't have to shoot those dogs. They will kill each other.
Excuse me.
Maybe I should come back another time.
I'm making you a steak.
You don't know nothing about it.
Stop it!
Son of a bitch!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
What?
What? What have we done?
You don't get along with anybody!
You ruined my life.
What?
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Awful?
Loretta?
What do you mean?
What time is it?
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
I have no secrets from my family.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Everything's different.
Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
You should think about this.
He owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
Don't fight.
Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
I came right from the airport.
It's late.
My mother's recovered.
That's incredible.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
I don't know.
Good.
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Yes.
Yes.
People home.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
I'm too old for you.
It's a house.
What? What?
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Cosmo.
There are?  Tell up.  What are they, wise Sir Bedevere?
Get away!
...What?
What do you mean?
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
King of the WHO?
Please, please good people.  I am in haste.  What knight lives in that castle?
Well, how did you become king, then?
All right!  All right! ... No more, please.  We will find you a shrubbery ...
You said it again!
Now stand aside worthy adversary.
Victory is mine.  I thank thee O Lord that in thy ...
'Allo.  Whoo is eet?
Please go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest,  and if he will give us food and shelter for this night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
No.  Ni!  More like this. "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
I do.  You seek the Holy Grail.
What?
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
Shut up!
The nose?
He will be soon. He's very ill.
I feel fine.
To find the Holy Grail.
Blue.
What is your name?
Don't be such a baby.
Thanks very much.
Who's that then?
I dunno, Must be a king.
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
I think I could pull through, sir.
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
But, Mother ...
How?
Yes?
Where are you going?
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
No, no, no.
Sixty.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
The good-looking one.
I'm getting dressed.
Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
You know nothing about her!
Aye.
What's your name?
Whom you address.
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
It's so infernally cold in here.
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
Her Highness' Equerry.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
Do you?
Awaiting my orders.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Dare say you can be taught.
I'm not married.
But yourself?  What about John Brown?
You are well?
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Archie.
Yes, ma'am.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
Who by?
What does he know about the Highlands?
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Must they always follow us?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
Yes.
A fine choice, sir.
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
Unwell?
Just tell me the fucking riddle.
How the hell did you do that?
Maybe he's not dead.
The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game.
Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford.
What do you mean by "weird"?
It is.
It's the middle of the night.  They're asleep.  Phone didn't wake them.
Then leave her.
The Police, then...
Yes I am...
What?
Thanks.  Always wanted to do that.
What?!  There's nothing here!
What is it?
So tell me you're okay, then.
So how do I start?
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
You gotta be kidding?
So what's the problem?
Well, just stop for a little second and think about it. Will ya do that for me?
There's sometimes a buggy. How many drivers does a buggy have?
I understand.
No, this one doesn't count. It's part of the original one. So then ... until we meet again.
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Right. See ya.
Betty.
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
No ..........I.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Those men in front, in the car.
Handstitched Italian. Filled with phony credit cards ... off the two guys in the Caddy.
Yeah... just .... Dr. Scott's got 'im. You remember Dr.Scott.
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Oh, things aren't so bad. Gee, I hope you're not goin' to get in any trouble.
No ... thanks though... I'll take a cigarette if you have one.
Where are we ?
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
No where. We've got about seven minutes before this thing slams into a concrete wall.
So what do we do ?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
McCay knows ?
You took an awful big risk back there.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
Just remember, hold your breath as long as you can. Then go right over to that corner. The door will open and go in and up.
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
NO. Don't. You'll get a shock from hell if you touch that seat.
Give me one good reason why I don't plug you right here, right now ? 
Is it over ?
I'd get out of the water if I were you.
You okay ?
Don't eat at the console.
He'll never get it right. Try the Log Ride !
What's wrong ?
He probably has a history of this shit.
I make roughly four hundred thousand a year.
Thank you, sir. I was really hoping for shares, or possibly cash... but this, this is really personal.
What about that time when the mail room kid was accused of stealing and we put him in the "Park" ? Wasn't that a computer glitch ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
Sir, this is not like firing any employee. We can't predict what will happen.
Sir ? We're moving them right along as fast as we can.
He has a phone pole sticking in his chest, I think we don't need an autopsy.
I've got five bucks that says someone dies here and now.
What the ... ?
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
It's sounds so much better when you say it. I'm semi traditional here, and it's important that I ask. Will you go out with me ?
Well, I make good investments, I lead a double life as a secret agent.. I....I ... I have very rich parents. I have always had a lot of money.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
What ?
No sir. I was just getting , well you know. Water. We weren't talking about sex or anything else except Star Wars. Just saying hello. I think I'm gonna go now.
Good morning.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
People said she looked like me.
Suspended from school, my mother??
I'm leaving Sunday.
Okay, no problem.
Well you know what I mean.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
I already bought a ticket.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
I'm glad you're here.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
oh.
See you? He can smell you from there.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
Ehh...I'm staying at the chateau and the guy who runs the garage there said that you're the best Jag people in town...so uhm.
Then I have come to the right place.
Hi there...can I help you?
I don't need you to be telling me to...
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
WHAT??
Change my name.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
Boyfriend?
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Right.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Muh??
Well Rose was being very thorough.
She lives here too?
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
Oh...what's that?
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
You know how I feel about you.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
You're Nick's mother?
I was commenting on your hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Something wrong?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
You couldn't?
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
They're enormous, I know.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Shelly?
No it doesn't but... I...I wish it did.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
Keep your voice down!
I'm impressed.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Harry, I really think she.....
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
Home sweet home.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
I ahh, better go.
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Shelly?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Dad?
Goodnight Vada.
She likes to play bingo.
Can I go too?
Hi.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Why?
Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to use fewer briquettes and now look what you've done. You've cremated them.
No, no no....
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
How much does it cost?
Yes I do, and I think she's very good for your father.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
My ball, I lost my ball.
No.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
Daddy??!?!?!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
Naah, I don't wanna.
It's a mosquito bite.
No.
Hey look at this!
Heaven.
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
I am running faster!!
So now you'll have a mother.
You can come to my house for dinner?
No, I'm hiding out.
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
Close your eyes.
Needs salt.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
Impressive.
The man you love.
What else did he tell you...
Don't you have to be somewh...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
But he always says...
For the twins? What in the world is th...
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
I never want to go through this again.
I thought Michael was picking me up.
What's the sec...
Such as.
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
Waiter! Check, please!
You never eat when you're despondent.
It's weird being the groom.  All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
Big weddings are so strange.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
What's up?
Uh.  I saw that moving...
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
He never mentioned that.  Neither did y...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What a sweet little picture.  Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Reverend Dyer, this is Kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
You got the money?
Feed, mostly. Thought we'd get something for the kids.
Grand Old Opera --
What did you say your name was?
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
Not a thing, Barnett, really. I need a little information. But, ah, it can wait.
Yes.
His Word.
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
How is she?
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Howdy.
National?
Come on. He's a crook.
Not yet.
How in the world did he get shot?
Haven's not going to talk to me.
Well, Mr. Green.
He is just wonderful.
What did you say?
Ah, hello. My name is Kenneth Fraser... And I'm here from Terre Haute, Indiana. Ah, listen ... somebody stole my handles.
Do you carry door handles?
Mom?
Nashville.
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
Have your children been deaf since birth?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Yes.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Wow!
What?
Doesn't it have a name?
Older.
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
I can do benefits
Wednesday at the park. We've got a lot of names coming in...
For him?
Where's Bill?
Probably a little too long.
Hal? Well, Hal and I have been friends for a long time.
He was a good Judge, but that was a long time ago.
Southern California.
Well, I admire your optimism, and I just wondered if it was regional. You ever see any movie stars?
Ah... Peter Finch.
Peter Finch -- he's English.
You serious?
Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
Yes you are.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
Are we in a big hurry?
The prison board made the decision. A board of which I belong. We're the who. The why is simple. Mickey and Mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
Lobotomy Bay?
She was born without a tongue.
Ah...fine. Let me make an adjustment here, and we'll be ready to rock 'n roll. Oh...uh, the dumbass at the donut place put a chocolate cream filled I asked for in your box.
You guys stay on your bellies.
It's video.
Ready.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Don't worry about it.
What I did for fun for starters.  Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun...  No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
That's indescribable.
Says who?
I could go for a Coke.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building.  Donut said something about a news van.
Just wait one fucking minute.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Hypnotizing.
He squashed him mentally before physically defeating him.
Only on a much grander scale.
They had us tied down during one of their house raids, you've seen the headlines, and they were taking a chainsaw to our legs before they were gonna kill us.
And then Mallory stops Mickey and says, 'Hey, these are the Brothers Hun.'
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Now we got to film a new intro for the follow up episode. But we put the intro for the first episode at the beginning temporarily so you can see it with some scope.
I'm as serious about that as I am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid Mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. Gimme that other box.
Roger, no.
Yeah, we met. They're good men.
Waitin' in the lounge.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
Why?
But you'll never be whole again.
Is that her real name?
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
Now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
Out.
You gonna buy me a beer, Frankie?
You know, Doris - you'd make some guy a swell wife.
Boy - you hear me?!
You a union man?
I'll smile when it's funny.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
She done moved to Detroit.
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Hey, boy - I'm talkin' to you.
Thanks.
Would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
Have anything in mind?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Well, he worked around.
No. Just me.  Me an' her.
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
No. I'm new in town.
You working?
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
No thanks.
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You almost got into trouble back there.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
Just for the day?
I didn't know you had one.
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
I'll see you later.
What?
Thank you.
Well, what d'you think?
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Hi.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
Where're you going to go?
Like a home, for one thing.
They all got families to support.
Plannin' on getting married?
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
No, thanks.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
Going back, huh?
That's right.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I doubt it.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
Let me get you another glass of wine.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
She's very striking, don't you think? Are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
I'm getting used to it. Where are we?
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
What are you talking about?
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
That's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
I prefer distrusting you. It'll keep us honest.
You're busy monkeys, Mr. Case. Busy, busy monkeys. Always building models... First stone circles. Then cathedrals... adding machines. I have no idea why I exist, do you know that? You... Your species eventually _had_ to create me. A thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. One finally wrote "Wintermute".
The access code to your mainframe.
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
Case... Yeah, Miami Joeboy, quick study. How you doing, kid?
As far as they know, that's absolutely true.
Ready?
It's mutating... spreading like a disease.
We got problems topside.
How much time you got left?
Less than thirty minutes.
You, I presume are Mr. Armitage. And this is...
I know who you are.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
I hope you can show more than you did when you let the Yakuza butcher Linda Lee.
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
What the fuck... are you serious?
A regular Fagan.
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Who?
How long will they watch us for?
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Leave.
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
Okay. That's bad.
That is lingerie.
Cuuuute!
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Transitioned?
: Wait. Do you know any gay guys?
He is totally crunching on you.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
God, I can't do this.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Is that true?
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
Rufus?
Thanks. And what are -
wasn't even thinking about-
Dorothy Parker--
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
This seat taken?
Boys.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
What?
Good. Gibby gave me champagne.
By name.
Didn't I tell you?  I'm always right, you know, my dear... Aren't I?
You're mine, you know.  I made you.
Of course you do, and I want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
Taste it.
When he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
You'd better be quiet, Sandy.
Just out for a while.
Oh, please...
Could be all night.  Guy gets his rocks off like this. Hangs out in queer S & M joints downtown.  Likes prettyboys like you.
It was okay.
I'm sorry...
What are you doing here?
The only thing trying to get into your body is female and waiting for you on a cabana floor.  And you want to sleep with me.  Go figure.
You okay?
Yeah, I know...synapses neurong...
Here.
You want to talk about it?
I'm not hungry.
Why won't you talk to me?
I'm afraid to go to sleep, I'm afraid to stay awake - I'm ruining your party. They're gonna put me away for sure.
Jesse, God - what happened?
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
Jess?
We're going up to bed now.
I'll need to take her things.
I thought I'd wait for you.
They're healing up nicely.
I know who's trying to kill you.
That man in my dreams.  He's real isn't he?
You like gymnastics?
You did it the other night.
What's that?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
A little basic, but nice.
Save your breath, Ms. Thompson.  Dr. Simms gave me specific instructions. Nobody gets to see Kristen -- especially you.  She made that real clear.
Anything?
Call me Nancy.
Never been here before?
Just until we get things under control.
I used to be like them, Neil.  I know what they're going through.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
To who?
We can try again.
That's precisely what they need.  Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
The whole facility was shut down in the Forties, wasn't it?  Some kind of scandal...
What did you think?
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Really?
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
Here we go.
Oh -- Okay.
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Yes, you did.
I'm sorry.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Well, get a message through to him too.
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yes.  Always have had.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
Well... how have you been?
... with you, I'm in real danger.  It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be.  There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill.  You live in Beverly Hills.  Everyone in the world knows who you are.  My mother has trouble remembering my name.
Liar.  She hates surprises.  What are you ordering?
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
Where are you going?
The movie star?
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
Ah -- no.  It's fine.
The others?
Mr. Thacker?
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
Cappuccino as ordered.
That's right -- Topol.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
Every time.  But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Any more announcements?
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Cool, huh?
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Right.  No one else?
Bollocks.  This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties.
Spike.
Spike!
I'll talk to you in the morning.
Yes.
Yes.
So?
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes, Billy?
Y-y-y-yes...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Yes, ma'am...
Will you come with me, please.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
I wanna report a robbery!
Right... I've been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' I got a few things I wanna get off my chest, before we get back to Harding's problem.
I'm not finished yet.
'Kay, item two. Tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. Tomorrow is the opening game of the World Series an' what I want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
Yeah, that'll do for openers!
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
Say... God Bless America!
Goddammit, you sly son-of-a-bitch! Does anybody else know?
Yeah, well, well, well. 'Bout time the rest of the world got a gander at Big Chief Bromden cuttin' down the boulevard, stopping just long enough for virgins... Oh, man, I tell you, I tell you, you'll have women trippin' you and beating you to the floor...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
How ya gettin' out, Mac?
You boys seem to think you've got a champ in there, huh?
Giving up?
What's your plan, Mack?
I refuse!
No!
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hear what?
What's this?
Whadaya doin', there's no one there!
Gimme the ball!
I saw thum! I saw thum!
Yup! Worked right outta Depoe Bay for just about every season since I was able to haul my own weight.
In what way?
To tell the truth, ever since I found my natural callin' I done time in so many small-time jails I could write a brochure...
Well, according to the Warden at Pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'It appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  What do you think of that report?
Well, you're here for a ninety-day observation period, Mister McMurphy. I'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. So, I'd like your cooperation!
Come on, Doc, you know as well as I do what's been comin' down in that loony bin.
Guidance and assistance! That's insane! Doc, ya gotta help me.
When?
Your medicine, Mister McMurphy.
Are you a doctor?
I'm the next one.
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
How much ya wanna bet?
Hey, how's it look up there, big boy?
Scanlon! Hey, Scanlon, wake up!
I tell ya, there's an angel of mercy standing out there, Turkle.
Hey, how ya doin'?
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yeah!
Bet you ass...
Oh, there you are, Mister Turkle.
Ah guess the natives are restless, ma'am...
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
She was your sister.
What?...
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Good.
Yes.  We did.
What?
No...
Dwayne?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
Hi there...
Lots of history.  For example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor Sirens?
Hm.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Do you want me to do it?
Well, it looks like we both lucked out.  I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
What?
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Hi.
I'd call that a yes.  Do I get a hint?
Really?...
Hello.
Well, not exactly...
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
Well, to-- new friends.
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
Is everything okay?
So?...
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
Kate, is something the matter?
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
You don't have a passport.
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Sure you did.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
I know, but...
What?
Amazing...
What if he doesn't like me?
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
Oh, hello.  I just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
You don't have to go if you don't want to...
It's not exploitation.  These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation?  She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
I came after the woman I love.
And then I saw her.  And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light.  And life and passion and yearning.  And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Right now?
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
I wish I knew.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
That's right... .
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
It wasn't him!  It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night— we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready— remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens— This bum Wilson he gets the title shot— outdoors in the ballpark! – and what do I get— a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville.  It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
I think we're O.K.
Which side are you with?
You training to be a nun or something?
I want to be a teacher.
How would you've done it?
What's that?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed—never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place—they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and—  But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
What a fruitcake you are!
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
Yeah, yeah... .  This Father Barry, what's his racket?
And if you don't?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
I know what you want me to do!
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
Edie...
Well, it's over.
Every one of 'em... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
You go to hell.
What did you say?
Who asked him here?
You all right, Nolan?
What do you think?
Baseball bats— that's just for openers. They'll put the muscle on you, turned-around collar or no turned-around collar.
What?
I think you could have.
Listen, this ain't for publication.
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
Shut up. I like the kid.  Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
How'd you get that.
You want to know somethin'—?
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin'— take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros—  —away and you're a great big hunk of nothing—  Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
You see, Kayo, the good Lord watches over us after all.
Listen— Nolan—
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
We sure picked the wrong night to find a cemetery.  Let's turn back.
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
Sure there are--and I've tried them all.  Plays, love stories, westerns, dog stories.  Huh, now there was a good one, that dog story all about--
All right.  Don't worry, I'll be right beside you.
Could it be some kind of college initiation?
Look!
You're talking nonsense.
All right.  Put it on heavy.
<i>Him!</i>  I'll bet he sleeps with all the lights on.
Well?
Ahh, she will be yours.
The moon is almost gone!
The time...is short.
Thank you, Master!  Thank you.
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.
We had lots of snakes in my ancient Egypt...slimy, slinky things.
What do you suppose for?
Did you howl off-key at the moon again?
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
What're you talking about?
Glenn Michaels.
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
Ask him his name.
I talk to the guy you work for, Emil. He tole me your number and where you live.  See, I'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
We were talking one time, drinking rum.  I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician.  Chino got interested.  He's like, Yeah?  How does he saw the woman in half?  He wanted to meet her.  Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Her phone's probably tapped.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
And she saw you?
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
Shit.
Jack --
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Daniel.  Listen --
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
Sure, Daniel.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Oh, is that right?  You going to shoot me?  Nice girl like you?  I don't think so.
Why you think is today?
You see what they doing, those posts out there?  Putting up another fence, five metres on the other side of the one that's there.  We wait until Super Bowl Sunday, they could have the second fence built and we have to dig another nine, ten days.  So we going soon as it's dark.  You want -- I mean it -- you can still come.
How are you, Raymond?
Yeah.  And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
Yeah, I got a problem.  This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns.  Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
Company, shit.  I watch the man's back.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
Reggie, push off and hit, man.  Push him off.
The fuck you talking about?
You know how to use one a these?
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Who, Buddy?  Yeah.  He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail.  She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
How many was that?
I believe you would have.  Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc.  And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
Faye Dunaway.
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
How do we do that?
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
You did?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
She did, huh.
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
Where?
Pretend I'm somebody else.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that?  Take her with you and put her in back.
Looks like tonight.
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Thanks for your help.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
No?  Where do you keep it, Dick?  I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Who is?  But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work.  You gotta look at it as peace of mind.  As <i>security</i>, you know what I mean?  I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
No need to decide now.  Be like the fish.  Let whatever happens happen.
Foley?  That you?
Have they got Midge up there?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
The <u>ninth</u>?
Hejira.
Apparently, yeah.  I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Do we have a gun in the car?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
I'm freezing my ass off.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
I can tell.
What do you want?
Here?  In this house?
He's still married though, huh?
Can we change the subject?
What are you thinking about?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Was it Foley?
You gonna go get him?
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
I spoke to her.  The guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
That's your line for tonight, ya know.
He was that good?
That's me, Sir.
That was a nice little stunt you pulled, buzzing the base.
What lizard?
Ever hear of mai-tai's?  Comes in a big...pot.  Like...like...
I th-think I'm gonna like it here.
Land of the free...
Didn't you say test the limits?
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
How come you're not pukin'?
It's tight.
I got a half a tank.  You?
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China.  I'm on your wing.
I can't make it.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker.  I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Well...sure.
I'd like to bomb their Emperor too.  But I think that'd just piss 'em off.  The idea here, Gentlemen, is not revenge. We're here to prove to them that they're neither invincible nor superior.  So let's try this again.  Military targets only.
Well sure, Colonel --
Our doctor's gone too.
I'm going to the war.  The real war. Hitler's taken Europe.  The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine.  And not just there, but here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F.  They need pilots, and we need experience.  I leave tomorrow.
How did you?...
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
So those brave men are flying blind and running out of fuel.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
If ye'd wanted a bloody Cadillac ya should'a stayed in the bloody States!
Learn English, then!
Hey, you're a hip chick. You look like you stepped right out of Life magazine. Any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Welcome to the singles scene.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
How do you feel?
You drive like a maniac!
I call this the staccato. 
Refresh my memory.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
Oh, God, Dion.
Hello, Charlie.
Terry! Slow down.
That commie beatnik? What's she doing with him? Wait'll I tell Charlie.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
You don't?
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Thank God for that.
Yes.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Sort of.
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Not to me they don't. I'm going to win the State, then the. Nationals, and then I'm going to the Olympics.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
You look pretty good for a corpse.
What're you doing?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow. 
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
What are you doing?
What do you know about hypnosis?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Silicon is from sand.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
You want some advice, friend? You get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
What was that all about? You think he's trying to scare us?
This time. What about next time?
Fuck you.
Maybe you should think about it.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
New baby?
Kids are great.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
We?
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
Continue.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Find a lawyer?
What's her name?
One more thing, Your Honor...
Get it?
No, we have to do it. But later, allright?
You survived your first gay party intact.
Uh huh...
I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area...
I know a good probate lawyer.
What kind of person is that?
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
What?
Rach.
Gay <u>pornographic</u> movies?
Some do. I didn't.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger...
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department.
Is that a question?
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
In what way?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
Uh.... No. Not really.
But, Andrew Beckett was in charge of litigation for the suit.
Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not?
Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think <u>I'm</u>...  ... gay?
You're the asshole, buddy.
How many do you know?
Lots.
Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties?
Right.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Now that you mention it...
Going on... like...?
Yeah. But we took care of him.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
I'll take that under consideration, Your Honor.
Let's continue.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
You'll be sorry, Beckett.
... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it.
What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are?
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Not sure where to go. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  Where you goin'?
Tell me that was you.
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Three full bottles. But almost time to refill.
'Course I am -- but doesn't mean I won't leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.
I would try for them.
Like the light is scalding it.
What, switch what?
...I don't play that...I don't play that so just try again. C'mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie....
Let's just be sure.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
You know, he hasn't harmed any of us. Far as I can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let him go if that's what it --
Not a problem unless you're gonna make --
You give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.
Are you fucking high again? Just listen to --
Just shut up, okay?
You hear me? Captain's dead. Owens too.
Can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
Company's not here, is it?
For what? There is no water. You understand that, don't you?
Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.
Say that again.
My recommendation: Do me. Don't take the chance that I'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick. Would if I were you.
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
About how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
Six of us left. If we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good thing, right?
Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New Guinea. Very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
How did you know we'd come here?
We've never meant to be treasonable, sir.  But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave -- and in that cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.
Indeed, the very fact that these tools are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable ...
The best. But we won't need them.
You've never told me why this region's called the Forbidden Zone.
That was different. We thought you were .... inferior.
The blood transfusion.
Zira, are you trying to get my head cut off?
It's probably wrong --
'I am not a missing link.'
Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!
We'd better get started. If the mounted police pick up our trail, they'll come this far at least.
You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.
It's a little late for a wake. She's been dead nearly a year.
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
If only we could get a fix.
All right --
Sorry, Lucius. You'll have to stay here and guard the horses.
They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
One is in a museum!
Well...do you acknowledge kinship with any of these creatures?
Then you admit --
Stop right there.
The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your breed made a desert of it, ages ago.
What is this?
He's dead! Where?... You saw him?
Stay out of this Elias. This ain't your show.
Says he can't walk.
Bob, I got Elias' R&R... It's coming up in 3 days. Going to Hawaii. See Patsy.  I never asked you for a break, I was hoping you... you'd send me in on the chopper with King... what do you say Chief? 
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
I'm talking to you Red and I'm telling you no. Get back to your position.
De fool think he's gonna get it but he ain't known for his thinking.
Hey Taylor, you don't know it but I saved your ass today. I killed a shit-eating dog. 
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Yeah?
Come on you can do better than that!
You lame Taylor?
Where's he from?
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
I was wrong.
...I can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
What are the heads?
Must be somebody?
Hey that's great King, that's great... you take it on home for me, you tell 'em King... got your address right? You know where you can reach men, man. Anytime!
...Motherfuckah, motherfuckah, I'm too short to be dealing with this shit! They keep fucking with us man, no letup...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
You volunteered for this shit man?
Shit! Morehouse and Sal are short. Fu Sheng's going on R&R, you don't want to send their asses out on an ambush. You got the fresh meat Elias.
Tell Six we need engineers here, this pos. is crawling with traps.
You know what I'm talking about!
I know Barnes six months and I'll tell ya something - that man is MEAN, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
Right on.
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Nice room. Balcony and everything. Lovely view too.
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
Not tonight.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Betty, this is Margo West. She wants to meet you. Miss Mayfield.
I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
He got in here how?
No. And I've never fired a gun in my life, Aren't you supposed not to touch it?
Cold?
No matter. There's nothing I can do about it.
So have I.
They're going to arrest me.
This is the ace, Betty.  But not of spades.  They'll find out about the other.  They might know already. And when they get this--  What would they look for?  Where? Out there somewhere? 
And Betty Mayfield--
Do you have to leave the note?
That, and the fun of it.
You think Magruder wants to hang beside me?
Me?
Do you think I was faking?
Yes, Miss.
Regimental! Seaforth Highlanders.
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
True. I was a bit irritable last night. I apologize.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
You won't tell me who you are? You won't even give me a chance to help you?
What does he see?
That's something I can't spare you.  But I won't do it myself.
I know that.
You do things the hard way, don't you?
Sometimes.
He could have killed me a dozen times.  You'd never have known.
Mr. Reed, please, for Mr.  Brandon.  Very well. Have him call. Mr. Brandon is in his office now.  Mr. Reed stepped out, Mr.  Brandon.
I'm still asking. What do you want?
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
How's life treating you?
Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
Could we discuss that some other time?
Would that make me a heel?
It could have been an accident.
How could Mitchell?  After that act he put on up here, is it likely she'd let him in?
Or just drunk enough.  He was with her when she registered.  He knew where her room was.  You were out most of the evening.  There was a lot of mess to clean up . Waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  Suppose Mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
No more for me, thanks.  Remember what I said.  I can't interfere with the law.
You forgetting the gag line, Killaine.  The police don't take anything for granted.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
That's not enough.
You could have got in that room, just as you got in here. How do I know you didn't kill Larry?
We've done that.  He's a San Francisco private eye.  Name Martin J. Goble, G-O-B-L-E.  Had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  Goble and Greer is the firm name.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
What's the face for, Driscoll?
You in charge here?
I've met her.
Pearl-handled .25 Automatic, uh?  No, it's a Belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
She didn't seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. That stuff was all gone through last night.  Anything special you're looking for, Inspector?
If she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
No doubt about that one.
Ye have, have ye?
But you still think she's innocent.
I believe you won decorations during the war.
Get out of here!
I have a rough idea.
Years, why?
I told you she's just..
You're very attractive, my dear. And you look very unsophisticated.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Here I am lecturing you.  Have some pâté.
So I can go ahead and be a historian without feeling like a poseur.I shall be fulfilling a citizen's duty.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
Did he?  I left school and worked for the Labour Party.  My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member.  I hero-worshipped him.  He was 25 years old ...  It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war.  We thought the country was about to become a true democracy.  I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time.  They feel betrayed.  They want to know what went wrong.
Now first of all, tell us your name.
Working hard on that book I was telling you about.  Coming to the meeting?
I'm not sure I can face it.
How's Mary?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
Aha.  James giving some woman the old heave-ho.
I know, I know!  Gentlemen, let me introduce you to one of our most talented contributors to The Cold War.  James Penfield.  He wrote the opening chapter, on 'The Berlin Airlift'.  One of the best chapters in the book.
...break away completely from--
Freshman and sophomores...
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Really?  I thought those long flashbacks were extremely good.
How nice.
Very thoughtful.
Again?
Me too.
Jeremy phoned this morning
It's shit.
You approve!
Well, everyone's desperate for a new Falkland's angle.  Purdy's come up with a real dog.  Worker's rights in Argentina.  So I've been running round getting people to do things.  But no one's keen.  Workers rights.  When did anyone on that paper give a damn about workers rights?  I said to Purdy, "Look, tits, bingo, jingo, horoscope, sport, celebs, gossip and the occasional firm stand on--"
Hold those rights.
Fortunate that I was here to keep Susan entertained.
And you were obviously getting nowhere with her.  I was waiting for the right moment to tell you that.
I'll tell you another thing.  We might have led the world once into the Industrial Revolution, now we lead with television commercials. We're the best, it's as simple as that.  Even the Americans will admit it now ... the camera work, the acting, the scripts, special effects.  We've got the lot.  Nearly all the good directors here have ambitions to make serious films.  That food you're eating.
I dunno.  Ploughman's Lunch.
Jeremy!  How Fantastic.
Oh no!
Don't point it at James!
Promise?
Don't close the door.  Don't turn out the hall light.
No.  So I was up the beach.  I saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. That's rare in this world.
Gonna be some people at my house tonight.  Maybe you can make it.
Football's a man-made game.  You keep score with numbers.  But in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  Just you and the wave.
Whoooaaah!  Shhiiittt!  Whoooaaah!
Talk.
Three seconds... two... one...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Sir?
Look, Harp.  Don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  Let me ride him in.
Good move.
Oh well he must be a surfer.
... Four months.  June to October. Mmmm...same the year before.
Angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
It sticks out, so I can't lock it. Look, Angelo, you think I joined the FBI to learn to surf?  This was your lame-o idea in the first place.  You gotta back me up on this.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
They're on their way to Maui.
I know where they're going.
I mean, what do you want?  What are you doing hanging around here.
Catch of the day.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
Meaning you were expendable.
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
What's goin' on?
What?
I... I gotta go.
So what'd the other guy look like?
No way, old buddy.
That's right, I set you up. You're a veteran at this, Dutch, I had to.
She's too valuable. She's got to know their whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
That's over the border, General.
I don't think so.  You should know we're going to fight you with every resource we have.
I know all about you, Mr. Harris. When you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  Even the pension funds are stripped clean. The last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
I... I don't know.  There... there wasn't time...
Regent Beverly Wilshire.  I bet you know it.
What's your name?
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
And why do you say that?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Mmm, I could tell.
I buy companies.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Of course.  How much?
But you want days too.
Three.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Was someone rude to you?
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Do I look okay?
Where are you taking me!?
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
It wouldn't be like that.  I want to get you off the street.  You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
What do you mean?
Business.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
The night I left your house, I was lost.  I was looking for directions.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I had to call.  I jus got off the phone with James Kross.  Get this.  He wants to see you. Today.
I think I broke my hand.  You're fired.
In Beverly Hills?
Yeah.
Was that you?
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Want a pair of boots?
Yeah, what?
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
That's all right.  I'm sure they're quite lovely.
Me?
May I help you?
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
You don't believe me?
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you-
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Catch your breath.
You mock my pain!
But what if something happens to you?
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
You're quick.
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
He's really very short on charm.
How many could you handle?
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
The body?
I have a little.
Will this do?
Inigo.
-hold it, hold it-
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
Yes.
See? Didn't I tell you she'd never marry that rotten Humperdinck?
Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who?
No! I'm okay. I'm okay.  -- sit down. All right?
As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
I tell you once again -- surrender!
Now?
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
Are you a rotten liar.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
How old were you?
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
You are wonderful!
Who are you?!
Get used to disappointment.
Kill me quickly.
I want to duel him left-handed.
You're that smart?
What's so funny?
He's afraid. Ever since Prince Humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
An hour.
Uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
Go!  You have fifty-eight seconds.
But the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
Oh, I fell on my keys.  I've got to get out of here.
Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me.
Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
I already have.  Come on.
Everybody's a big shot.  Well, Leo, are you having a good time?
What???
Don't help me.
"I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy ...
Really, I never dreamed ...
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
Five o'clock.  Killed a whole day playing hide-and-seek with a crazy Kraut.
Come on.  Let's get going.
Do you need us?
Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings.
Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes.
Nietzche...
The Graf Spee...
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Where's Goebbels?  Where's my little Joe?
Hey, baby, that's good!  How'd we come out?
What?
Not at all!
Anyone at home?
I live there. Alone.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
If she paid you well?
Now, look...!
Let's all talk about Mary.
Must've needed it.
Casharoonie!
With a little checking, I could get to believe you.
You mean you don't want the usual day and a half to think it over?  You are in a hurry! Somebody chasin' you?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
Aren't you going to take the pills?  They'll knock that headache out.
No, Mr. Lowery... but then she's always a bit late on Monday mornings.
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
She stole some money.
Please!
What difference does that...
A good reason, I suppose.
I didn't see her... and I didn't hear from her! Believe that!
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Where could he have gone?
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I don't know where to start...  Except at the beginning.
You won't believe it...  But this will be the first time I've ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
Bates never denied Mary was here.
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
I'm sorry, Mary.  My old Dad used to say 'when you can't change a situation, laugh at it.' Nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
You can't laugh at it, huh?
I have to go, Sam.
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Don't miss your plane.
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she isn't herself today"... I think that's it.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
Alright, Miss... 
In quite a hurry.
May I see your license?
Oh?
Mary is Lila's sister?
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
I won't have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, I suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
And then what? After supper, music? Whispers?
Mother, she's just a stranger!  As if men don't desire strangers, as if... oh, I refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! You understand, Boy?
You didn't find anything.
By gosh, them stiffs are get- tin' heavier and more of 'em every day. They even got the coroner working overtime.
You--a friend to me?
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
He's been stealing my cats to experiment on [them]. I know cause I've been [watching] spying on him.
Well, news of Buckley?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Oh no. Mostly research in endocrinology.
Yes. Mr. Buckley thinks you treated him a little rough. He's in the hospital. How about it?
What are you going to do?
That spoke to you?
Did you hear?
There's no child here, and no dogs either.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
Another fragment of the diary is shown [having to do with vampires].
No -- I didn't. It was Igor at the waxworks.
You lie!
Did you? Where?
We'll be coming to the opening.
But I think these things are beautiful.
But it was really my fault.
Listen, copper, get a load of this. While you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, I run down this story ... my story. Consider yourself my assistant.
Whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
You give me a pain!
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Listen, Jim -- and if you wisecrack while I'm talking I'll crown you with the inkwell.
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
I used to be married to one.
That dear, innocent Judge Ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in South America.
This one's a story, but I'm not going to tell you what it is. Every time I tell you anything it goes haywire.
Call the Homicide Squad!
I'm people which the old year saw out. I'm canned, fired!
I've got to make news, if I have to bite a dog.  Hey, Kelly! Oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
Yes, she committed suicide yesterday. That's not news. I heard about it last year.
What do you mean police dog?
Uh-huh. Do you remember what she said? What did you talk about?
Why?
Everything, my friend. And you hope to be a great sculptor --  A great sculptor. Look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
I wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, Mr. Igor. The weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
Have you got it? Is it completed?
Shall we unpack it?
Of what?
A five hundred foot thick steel wall.  But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Where is she?
I am in awe of it, Mother.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
No, I'm awake. What's the matter?
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
What is it, Rose?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh?
You're going to get yourself up and go out?
Yeah.
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Well, that doctor said you got protein somewhere and I guess he was right.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
Of course not!
That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand?
But how would you find him?
Well, I don't know.  No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it.
In the kitchen drinking all the ice water in Glenville. She walked out here, she didn't go by the hotel.
Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil?
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now.
She's watching the car again?
Wonderful? He kissed her and played with her titty, and I don't see anything so great about that. He was probably afraid Mother would come back early and catch him.
How could that be, son?
You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity...  Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy?
A wonderful woman, boy.
All right, Daddy. We have our drink, we're out on the patio, you have prepared me for it. Rose's cancer has come back, hasn't it?
I am afraid so, son. About a week ago. Her husband phoned me, she had asked him to call me if anything happened.
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
How goes it, darlin'?
Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much.  In a perfectly proper way, of course.
I said I don't intend to fire her. I just want to ask her to keep her boy friends away from my home and hearth, that's all.
Who is to say our morals are better than hers?  But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
They follow her because she's a --  -- no, I won't say that.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
This conversation is making me a little sick.
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Honey, he is Mr. Right.
All right, all right. Now calm down, Rose, the children will hear you. Calm down, let's talk... about this thing, let's discuss it.
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
I got an awful bad cold.
I mean a human investment, Rose, we care about you, you matter to us. But we have innocent and unformed children in this house and the monkey and dog show has got to stop. Do you hear me?
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Yes, I am.
Near Alexandria. It isn't in Alexandria, it is outside it.
What do you want me to tell her, Dave?
She looks terrible, just awful.
I'm sorry the truth nauseates you, Mrs. Hillyer, because before you leave there's a bit more of it I'd like to put to you. This operation provides a therapeutic opportunity that I feel is quite important in regard to this particular girl, who suffers not only from an ovarian cyst but from a certain psychoneurotic condition as well.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
More history, Rose.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
Know what he's doing, Benny?  He's trying to jog your memory.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
Relax.
What are you, Henry friggin' Kissinger all the sudden?
Remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
Who's been giving you history lessons?  Your bartender?
Where we going?
You never heard of physics, Einstein? The laws of physics.  The more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
What the... ?!  What was that for?
Okay.  But, what changed our mind?
No, we're stealing.
Billy, I love you I really do... but I've got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
Feels like there's a bullet still in my chest.
You can't be serious.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  Some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you're actually taking the time to read it.
Think Zimmermann's watching?
Yeah.
It's one of a kind.
This shit was Ming.
Where am I?
Jabba's palace.
The same as always.
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
I'm sure Luke wasn't on that thing when it blew.
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?
Proper?!
I'm going in.
Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
Tell me.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
You!
Why you - what have you done with Janet?
Janet!
It's as if we were glued to the spot.
Janet.
Uh huh.
You'd better sit here and keep warm while I go for help.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
But it seems so unhealthy here.
Oh Brad.
Janet!  Oh!  Yes it's alright.  Janet. Everything's going to be alright.
And that's all the time that it takes For a heart to beat again. So give me a sign That a lover makes You look around The one you've found Is back again.
Great scott - Scotty - Dr Everett Scott.
Great Heavens, that's a laser.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Now I
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
No no no, no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Are you - giving a party?
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
...I'm sorry.
...I don't know.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
Yes, I do.
I think he might be worried.
I always knew you was pretty.
What did you say about a pet shop?
...What?
What're we going to do?
Don't say that.
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
My side.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
I contacted Ernie Roman's manager, he's fighting in France the same week.
Fouls.
You're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
Still to be held in Philadelphia?
Hear she's retarded.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Why?
No dollar.
Hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
This a con?
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
How 'bout some Cokes?
We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
There's no way Apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
A hundred an' thirty.
That's it, I'm broke.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Gonna try.
Black market?
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
Rocky, do you have any representation? A manager?
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Makes your breath like garbage.
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
What?
I won't.
How old are ya?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
...No.
Here's the card?
Yeah.
Fifty years, huh.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
Maybe ya better forget it.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
Gazzo's a good man.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
You ballin' her?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
...People talk to me more.
We can cut that out later. Apollo Creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
Do you feel you have a chance?
You serve martinis, doncha?
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
Yeah, you still got it, Betty.  Who's Mr. Jocularity?
A tweeting bird?
<u>That</u> was the rabbit's wife.
You're not takin' me to downtown <u>Toon</u>town?
The pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
A freeway, Mr. Valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from L.A. to Pasadena.  Pasadena to Hollywood.  Hollywood to Santa Monica. Someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the L.A. Basin to another.
Hello, Mr. Valiant.  I rang the doorbell, but I guess you couldn't hear it.
Come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
You've got the wrong idea about me. I'a a pawn in this just like poor Roger.  Can you help me find him?  I'll pay you anything.
You shot Roger.
I didn't know who I could trust.
How did you get onto Doom?
Now what?
Yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  I'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest Bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. And you know why?
Here's the problem...  "Seen cooing over calamari with notsonew Sugar Daddy was Jessica Rabbit... wife of Maroon star, Roger".  His wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's Betty Crocker.  The doubt's eatin' him up.
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
No, I don't.
Well, I asked the newsboy on the corner.  He didn't know.  Then I asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  He was very helpful.
Well... I still don't think he'd turn me in.
I've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  But you, Edward Valiant, are positively funereal!
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
But, Eddie, you know what happens when...
Gee, I didn't recognize you... I've never seen you laugh before.  That your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
I'll get it.
I tell you what, maybe I better come with you.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Leave Me!
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Then I'll leave thee.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
Is the day so young?
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Such mortal drugs I have, but Verona's law is death to any that utters them.
Drink it off and, if you had the strength of twenty men it would dispatch you straight.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Where is my Lady's lord?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Geth thee to be and rest, for thou has need.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Go! We follow thee. Juliet, Blah!
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
It's under your seat.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
Then Swede and I split with the package and meet you back at the rendezvous.
I never did trust that blonde fuck...
Oh yeah?  Whatta you drink, then?
So you thought that maybe I'd grown too attached to this charade I've been playing, is that it?
Not to me, you know that.
What in bloody hell is going on?
You're thinking with your gun, Seamus, and not your head...
The two of you were supposed to go to a simple meet and come back with a simple piece of information, and instead you went to fucking war...
It's quite satifactory.
I use my cell phone to get computer access to the telecommunications satellite used by our target.  I trace his cell phone signature and use it to pin point his location as he moves through Nice, relaying that information to you.
I'm touched, really, that they'd send someone of your caliber.  It's nice to know that they didn't make the mistake of underestimating me twice.
You first, Edvard.
We'll die if we stay here!
But you hate each other!
Whoever hired us.
I swear...
I hadn't thought about it.  Understand me, Gregor -- I take no pleasure in killing.  It doesn't bother me one bit, but I don't get off on it.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.
It gets done now or not at all.  Another couple of days and the parties concerned are gone where I can't get them.
He sees this differently, as you well know.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Is that right?
I'm Vincent.  And I coordinate.
To see a man about a thing.
Jujitsu.
A cigarette?  As in one?  One cigarette a week, who smokes like that?
They certainly are.  Whatever it is we're going to steal, it must be quite something.
I won't lie -- there have been times when I had to do it, times when the only way to get out alive was to see that the other man didn't.
I didn't save your life back there. Risked it, maybe -- but I didn't save shit.
No hospitals.  I'll fix this myself if I have to.
Then quit.  You don't work for Interpol, Sam.
Dark ops?
I never made that claim.
What?
I know.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Gaelic.
What I've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk.  I wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like I said, the Irish and the Russians are an unlikely mix.
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
Tony and I have to talk some business, first.
Damn.
Yeah...I remember my brother-in-law Gary, the wheel watcher.  He finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  Plus some leather furniture. Do you think I saw any of that?  His excuse was the government got it all.
There must be over a million dollars in here.
Look around you partner!  You said yourself you never saw anything like it.
Who's going to question us? Dwayne?  Jesse?
We're going to be patient. If we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
I don't know...
That's not what I mean.
No we didn't.  He died on his own.
Shit!  We're gonna have to get rid of him.  I'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  We can't risk it.
That's not what I mean.
How long is it going to take?!
I don't know.  They got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
He killed her...he killed her...
No.  It stops now.  It stops here.
You're the one who's nuts! There's no one left to touch us, Booth.  We're home free!  We just plant a little of the money on Dwayne, and it's all ours.
I don't like getting grilled by that DEA bitch, I don't like taking that kind of heat!
None of us like it!
Don't have much choice, Jesse. You saw to that!
OKAY! IT'S UNDER MY DESK!!  TAPED TO THE BOTTOM SIDE!!!
Normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. The last we heard from him was two days ago.
I'm just tired is all.  I'll see you tonight OK baby?
You're worth every last penny.
Every night I think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
A satellite dish?
How are we going to do all this?
What did he buy?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
A week ago, at most.
I have a better plan.  You want to hear it?
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
I don't know.
I guess we can get started.
He kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  I contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
Don't you have to be here?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Sheriff Hogan --
Not exactly.  It's some lingerie store on the strip.
No, I can't say that I have.
A lot of men come in here?
Well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and I figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
Hey where's the hot pad?
Dwayne please calm down!
Well you're not getting, either.
I was on a roll!  I’m a little overextended now.
Oh Jesus Christ...
I knew it, I knew it all along - shit!
I'm not getting an answer.
It's nine-thirty in the morning.
Winner six!
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service.
It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit.
You bring American money?
Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor.
Don't be messing with me, Lee.  I will kick your ass.  I'll hit you so hard you'll end up in the Ming Dynasty.
I'm sorry.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
Just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
What's wrong?
Remember I told you my father was a policeman?  Ricky Tan was his partner for ten years.
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
You said --
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
You pull a muscle or something?
She's getting undressed.
I don't understand?
It's your turn!
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
She never even looked at you.
You got that right.  And we ain't brothers.  Maybe we should just end this right here.
No.
Mind your own business.
How was the sex?
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
We made it, man.
New York City?
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
You move well.
Are you okay?
Baby Duck?
Tell me why they killed the customs agents.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
If you reach for that gun, I'm going to kill you.
Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
You talk very fast.
You have one of these?
I thought you were taking me to the consulate.
Right....
What plate?
Don't go there...
What?
Let's go.  Everybody take off?
You see what I'm sayin'? You control the space.
Yes, I know this song.
No...what?
What's wrong with that?
Oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  They sent for the Ambassador's personal Chinese Investigator type.  He is like the baddest Asian shield they got.  And I, let me repeat that, I am the man who is on the case with him.  Just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
Wait a minute. I'm not riding in that.
Yeah. So why you look do down?
At this point we don't have much.
You come highly recommended, Carter. And your particular assignment requires a special talent.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a Chinese National and here under difficult circumstances.  His name is Lee.  And he is to be shown every courtesy. Within reason.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
Why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
You know something? Every time I see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  With two shots of non-fat milk.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
Hello.
I was trying to find the right time.
I will not have friends in America.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
You don't understand this guy.
Right.
Yes.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
"Nothing but net."
-- It's for you, Ike.
See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Fisher, let him talk.
Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
Of course we are.  Of course.
Your job is... the ring.  Do you have the ring?!
Sorry, no.  I just got one.
You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick.
How romantic.
Give me that!
So?  Is that what you said to her?
I don't know.
Kind of isolated.
Are you all right with this?  You think this is funny?
It's fun!  It's high.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
I'm going to kill myself.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But I'm weird.
Lighten up, wahine.
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
No, I'm just going to head home.
No.  It's my life.
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
Nope.
What am I going to do with a microwave?
But it's on the water.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Happy New Year, darling.
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers.  Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
That doesn't make any sense.
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
You go.
I told you.  Nothing --
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
Can too.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Magic.
The point is, take the client out to dinner and ask her to marry you and then maybe we won't have to redo the kitchen cabinets.
All righ...
It's been about a year and a half.
Hey, my plate is full.
Sandy has a girlfriend, Clenda ... She's a weightlifter, but it's not like her neck is bigger than her head or anything --
It's Y. O. H.
Yeah.  What's that?
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Stressed.
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
Oklahoma.  Do you know where that is?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
Will she scratch up your back?
I never did.  Or the whole idea of an afterlife.  But I don't know any more.  I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway.  So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
Listen to this --
Was Mom an adjustment?
You said we could go to New York.
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Well...
Move on.  Right.  That's what I'm going to do.  In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Take a drink. Calm down!
It's the paymaster from Moscow -- with our gold.
You know the beef. This new rule of yours, that we work alone. We're taking it up with the Super.
Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants to get his brothers out. In one piece.
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
It's all set. Consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. We're taking over.
But you had to have it, didn't you? It was so nice to listen
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
Never... never... never!
Antonio paid for it.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
Tell me.
And you know why? Because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. What's it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before.  They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
Charley Vidal says!  Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
Why didn't you support her? You're the worst of the lot.
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
You've got to help around the house!
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
What attitude?
What you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. It'll take you right to the highway.
Bobby?
Yeah.
Now that's down-right insulting.
Yeah.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers?  I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Really, I don't want to.
Never mind. Just do what I say. He holds out the baggie. Colette backs away.
Closure? How do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
Is that what you want me to do?  Put it all on Jesus?  Let him sort it out in the afterlife?
Where to?
Why's that?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
Why does it have to feel so bad?
You remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
Yeah, that's what I mean.  Where the hell does this guy live anyway?
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
Did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they didn't do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
Just some buddies.
I've got a hot one.
God damn, Flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
You think this is funny motherfucker?
Whata you mean I've got no choice?
Danny?
Danny, it's really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember DOMINGO, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
What?!
He's the only one I told.
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
Speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
Really?
Just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. It could get ugly in there.
Resistance?
But, sir...I...I...
I'm Jackson.  I'm from West Fork, Tennessee.  My pappy's a preacher. Him and his two brothers got a ministry, The Blessed Church of the Wandering Gospel.
If we find Ryan and he's still alive, that son-of-a-bitch is gonna carry this goddamned B.A.R. back to the beach for me.
Shut up, will you?
Y'all come back.
He ain't half-bad, I guess.
No kiddin'?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
I'm in my backyard, lying in my hammock, with my arm around my wife, listening for the sound of breaking glass.
Upham?
I wonder where they're going.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
Now we've got a straight shot, due north, to Ramelle, twenty-six miles, two villages between here and there, St. Mere, then Bernay.  We'll take the jeep as far as we can, then go on on foot.
Uh, Captain...
Nope.
Is it getting worse?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
Yeah, Vecchio, I couldn't remember his name, he was a good kid, remember how he used to walk on his hands and sing that song about the man on flying trapeze?
Oh, yeah?
I think you're right, Keith.
What do you think?
What are we going to do?
Strides through the chaos, avoiding the passing vehicles.  He sees his men and walks toward them.  Reiben hurries up to Miller, pleading.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
Thank you, sir.
Frogs?
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
How do you do it?
You think he really believed it?
Pardon me?
What's the profile?
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
Don't let your father's business infect your life.
What family?  We never heard from them.  I sold her house for them, made them money.
I'll take the whole set.
Keep it.
You're sure?
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Lloyd, honey, just come home, okay?
No, you're not a guy.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
I'll put this past my boss
What are you doing?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream.  I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Which they did.  Let me finish.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Honey, about what?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Well...
I'll go.
So it's an honor?
He does this every year?
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
I think you should wear that.
Okay, bye, I will.
Yes.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
No.
Yeah?
Am I wrecking my car?
This is so noble.
Then why are you shaking?
No, we don't have to say it.
No, no.
No.
What do you want?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
Okay.
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
Hey man, I was in love once.  I got hurt really bad.  I never wanna go through that again.
YEAH!
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
No.
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Yeah, she is.  Good luck.
Hello Lloyd.
Thanks Lloyd.
Are you?
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
What?
I love you man
Should I stay?
You know, they told me you were going to be trouble - Czurda and Scherner.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
I just told you.
I want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
I work hard for you.  I'll continue to work hard for you.
Yeah, okay.
What's wrong with it?
I thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
It kind of looks that way.
Jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
I could try to read this or I could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  We're doing well?
I think it's too late.
I could've got more ... if I'd just ... I don't know, if I'd just ... I could've got more...
We know that, son.
How's the name search going?
Don't. Think Bailey.
What is it?
I heard a noise.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.  I thought you were someone else.
Where is everybody?
Why would you wanna do that?
You wrote me a letter. Very cordial. Very appropriate.
It’s perfect, Sidney. No one will ever suspect me. I have proof. I’m the victim.
Fair enough.
Do I know you? You look familiar.
No way.
I skipped. Too many "That's her" looks.
Go on, untie him.
Why?
He seemed harmless.
We’re hoping for the death penalty. I have this whole DEAD MAN WALKING swan song exit planned.
Yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. It really is the curse of the sequel. The Billy/Stu thing’s been done.
I see you read the book.
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
Yeah?
Maybe not. But think about the sex. As frustrated as I am...
The sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
This is all too familiar.
As of now, they don't see any relation. But they're checking it out. The state, Special Task Force, FBI--they're all here. They'll find the guy.
Dewey, I'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
Just in case...
Hey, I got stuff to do. But I'll find you later, okay.
Where are you?
Yes, goddammit!
Lucas and his Romper Room stage.
He tried to kill her first.
I got a surprise for you.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..harmonica style is okay.
Gale?
Take it off.
But...
Come on, baby. Lighten up a little, will ya?
I'll be right back.
Thanks for the movie, Randy.
There's always someone out there stalking actors. Look at that woman from the Commish.
Asshole, Can't talk.
What kind of a game?
I swear to God if you lay a finger on her I'll fucking kill you!
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
I go to the police station and do my job, and you go back to being Gale Weathers.
That's STAB 3, Miss Weathers. It looks like we're going to be getting a warrant to speak with Miss Prescott anyway.
I'm not at liberty to tell you that Miss Weathers. You're no longer working with the L.A.P.D. I don't even know why you're standing in here right now. By all means I should have you thrown out.
No, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business.  I grew up here, and I know my way around the studios.
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
Well it's not safe for me up there either. The killer found me Dewey. He called me last night.
Karen Colcheck. From Woodsboro.
Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
I happen to work for the police god dammit!
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
OH. OH GOD. GALE --
Paternity test results. Christ Dewey, you're never going to believe who Milton's kid is.
What's your point?
God damn you Gale Weathers! Don't you see? The killer is choosing  his victims as they die in the script! Ben Damon's character was the first one to get offed. So was his girlfriend - but she wasn't cast yet so his real girlfriend was killed - then Sarah Darling's Candy, and now me!
What the hell are you doing?
And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch.
I think Milton's the killer. I think he just went out to kill another cast member.
Well then, I guess I'll be leaving then.
Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.
Oh my God! Sidney, you ran fast or what?  Hey.
Oh my God Karen you scared the shit out of me! What are you doing here?
Gale he's got Dewey!
Roman Bridger, director. And brother.  She slammed the door in my face, Sid. Said I was Rina's child and Rina was dead. And it struck me, what a good idea! So I watched her, made a little home movie, a little family film. Seems Maureen, mom, really got around. I mean, Cotton Weary was one thing, everybody knew about that, but Billy's father, that was the key! Your boyfriend didn't like seeing his daddy in my movies. Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers. Have a partner to sell out in case you get caught, find someone to frame, it was like her was making a movie.
I'm not happy that I'm 35 playing a 21 year old. I'm not happy that I have to die naked!  And I'm not happy that my character is too stupid not to have a gun in the house after her boyfriend's been cut into McNuggets.
Huh, fine.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
Let them try. You'll never find me. I've already gotten away with murder before. For instance, Maureen Prescott.
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
She'd have been so happy, Sidney, to know we'd be together.
WHERE?
No I need to call you. Just you.
What? She asked.
You open your mouth and stupidity pours out.
Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise -- Stu, I believe it's your turn.
This is the best part, Sid. Billy's got it all figured out. Why do you think we kept your father alive so long? Why did we save you for last?
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
Yeah, it was edited for TV. All the good stuff was cut out and I started thinking about us and how two years ago, we started off kinda hot and heavy, a nice solid "R" rating on our way to an NC17. And how things have changed and, lately, we're just sot of... edited for television.
No, it's me, Billy. I need time. I'm still adjusting to my mom.
No, Billy. I'm the one who's been selfish and self-absorbed with all of my post traumatic stress.
No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
Uh-huh.
NO! Don't believe him.
Fuck you.
Why did you kill my mother?
I don't know.
Who is this?
Guess.
Is that the one where the guy had knives for fingers?
Freddy -- that's right. I liked that movie. It was scary.
Why do you want to know my name?
I have to go now.
To talk.
Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else.
No... please.
Don't do this. I can't...
Please go away! Leave us alone!
It was Jason. I saw that goddamned movie twenty times. It was Jason.
If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
You never know when or where a story will break.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Have they found my father?
She's tough.
She's okay. Looks like some boys were teasing her. Himbry's shutting down the school though. I want you to take look around.
Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott -- Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning -- we'll do a house to house.
Where is she?
No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete.
Your mother's murder was last year's hottest court case. Somebody was gonna write a book about it.
Many times.
She was never attacked. I think she made it all up.
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
Can you knock?
No? Oh, well... I'm hitting the sack. My flight leaves first thing in the morning. Now the expo runs all weekend so I won't be back til Sunday. There's cash on the table and I'll be staying at the Raleigh Hilton...
...out at the airport...
Jesus, this place is packed.
Why would he want to kill his own girlfriend?
She's saving herself for you.
I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie -- you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back."
His movie nut mind has snapped, Sid. He's gone psycho.
You're crazy -- both of you.
Do they know who did it?
Or a man's mentality.
Practice ran late. I'm on my way.
You can't prove a rumor. That's why it's a rumor.
No way.
What about the trace on his bank account and the guns?  There must be something to connect him with a past.
What do you think?
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
Already.
It's none of my business anymore.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
How you feeling?
She was... she was on the bed.  She was just sitting on the bed.
What's so exciting?
You can't see the whole... the whole complete act yet.  Not yet.  But, when this is done, it's going to be... so... so...
I can't wait for you to see.  I can't wait...  It's really going to be something.
Delusions of grandeur.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
Just keep leading the way.
What the fuck is going on?
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
I wasn't standing around guarding the local Taco Bell.  I've worked homicide for five and a half years.
When we found him, he was lying there with a knife in his back, so what else could it be but homicide?  Except, I finally figured out... he held the knife behind him... put the tip of it in his own back and got real close to the wall... then he shoved his body backwards...
Is there any blood in it?
You think it was poison?
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Same color and texture.
It's my wife.
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
What about sports?
Our guy got into office, probably before the building closed and security tightened up.  Gould must have been working late.
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
How was it?
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Victor's landlord says an envelope of cash was in the office mailbox each month.  He says, quote, "I never heard a single complaint from the tenant in apartment three-o-one, and nobody ever complained about him.  He's the best tenant I've ever had.
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
There must be something in this pile of garbage we can follow.  I mean, Christ... do we have to let this lunatic make all the moves.
How is this legal?
We could use about fifty more men here.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
As soon as this is over, I'm gone.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
Don't do this... please...
This painting...
I mean, you known this city.  You've been here for so long.
I feel strange being here with you... without David knowing.
It was, I tell you!
She sure is!...An' don't think your comin' back is goin' to change it!
What right you got to be talkin' marriage to any decent woman...
No sir...pleasure.
You all right, sergeant?
Dunno...Seems so.
Ethan, you an' Martin are hereby appointed civilian scouts -- without pay...Charlie, hightail it to head- quarters an' spread the word...
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
I say NO!
How'd you come by this?
Yes, sir.
Name's Ethan...Now what's so mighty fishy about this trail?
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
Jorgensen's been runnin' his cattle with my own...
All right...I ain't got no kin... I'm goin' to keep lookin' that's all.
Martin...I want you to know some- thin'...
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
Suit yourself...While you're enjoyin' your little conversation, I'll be ridin' out with Senor Fernandez here... The Comanch' medicine country ain't far...there's one camp with a chief named Cicatriz.
Not no more.
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
Livin' with Comanches ain't bein' alive...
Not far from it...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
You've seen her!...She's alive?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
Finish your breakfast...
Don't cry, Laurie...I understand how it is...I'll just go 'way...
<U>Laurie</U>! Shut your mouth!
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Where have you been all day?
No, I've never seen him before.
You know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  Flowers incorporate a beauty that I always missed in life.  But certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
I think it's starting again. You know... there was something peculiar.  If only I knew...
And the title of this piece?
The title won't do.
What do you want, Kit?
Twenty pounds on delivery
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo!
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Are you writing?
I am here to help you. Tell me in your own words.
Most interesting.
And your relations?
No, your marriage bed.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
What piece? Richard Crookback?
By God, I wish I knew.
How will it?
Another little problem.
What do we do now?
Good title.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
The daughter of his enemy.
"But new struck nine."
"Out."
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
Not ready? Where is she?
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Playhouses are not for well-born ladies.
As a nurse.
Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
But your voice  Have they dropped?
It is not my fault, Master Shakespeare. I could do it yesterday.
I am Ethel, sir, the Pirate's daughter.
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
Can you love a fool?
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
Moonlight!
No, the morning rooster woke me.
There is time. It is still dark.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
How does it?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Your name?
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
A theatre poet?
I don't want to devalue your victory, but I just want you to know: I wasn't trying to win.
Have you seen him?
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
So who's going to do it?
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
That was good.
What is this?
You're sure? There's lots more.
But they know.
They know.
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
I've never seen any of these men before.
That's all?
And you like it?
Did you know --
I thought you stopped going.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
So we'll meet him, then?
The man we know and love.
Why not? What's wrong, Juliet? Aren't you curious? Don't you wonder what he died from?
No, Alex. It's, it's --
Stop nagging.
No, I don't.
Hello. Hello.
Will you calm down.
It tastes different.
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
Expecting anyone?
I don't know. I thought maybe I was --
You mustn't take it so badly.
What?
You were going to say something.
You mean I can have the room?
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall and this is DC Mitchell. I wonder if we could ask you some questions.
Of course.
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Two?
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
Yes. Why do you think you woke and they didn't?
Just get on with it, Alex.
Would you like to talk about it?
Who have you talked to?
Here.
Not any real sneering as such, no.
Eh --
Yes, sir.
And that's why I think you fit in here.
What guy that died?
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
Working nights?
That sounds fine.
Both, sir.
Your watch.
It's great.  You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Maybe... why do you ask?
That you were just indulging me.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
She's got a...
-- What?
Nummers.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
You're looking great, baby.
I know.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
But aren't you...
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
No thanks.
Yeah.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Yeah.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
I am not!
And you need money?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
George!
You're late, George.
He's a very private person, actually.
Probably the bathroom.
Great.
Whew.
It's hot in here.
You did, I know you did.
What about it?
Jackie, can we --
-- gee...
No you didn't.
Sammy's?
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
Mmmm --
Yeah?...
Otis is dead.
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Well, like what?
Now, George --
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Honey, what happened?
You're different.
We live together now.
You've never even been around one.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Great.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
Right now?
Never mind. Where've you been?
Look at the way I live.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
Ha, ha.
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
Well that's something.
Yes.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
-- please, baby --
Stop it.
What did you say?
George...
No?
But what?
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
I know it, I know it.
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
I mean, how did that happen?
You're home.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
-- Yeah, honey...
Well, you know what I mean.
What?
Honey?
C'mon.
-- Yesss?
But why Egypt?
-- never mind.
Good for you.
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
No... how long did you say?
Are you married?
No.
No!
We'll let you know tomorrow.
Have they sat down?
No of course not.
You mean they ate each other up?
Tony.
Who's Tony?
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Yes.
Well, you know Doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
We're just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I'll come back and check on you, okay?
The loser has to keep American clean, how's that?
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Danny, come here!
What's the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
Now Danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
How did he manage to do that?
Sure.
Hi Lloyd.  I've been away.  Now I'm back.
I'm the kind of man likes to know who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
I had... I had the most terrible nightmare I ever had.  It's the most horrible dream I ever had.
Somebody did that to him.
Yes.
Why?
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
I'm Jack Torrance.
Very nice to meet you.
Physically, it's not a very demanding job.  The only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
That's very good Jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
shut in together over long periods of time.
Well, obviously some people can be
No, my son's discovered the games room.
Yes, I believe they are based mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  We've had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
Jane... you don't have to do that.
I used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did I! I mean I know how stupid that sounds, but...
No.
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
Don't call me dear boy.
It came for me! I shot it in the eye! Now he's wearing an eye-patch!
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
No... but I found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
Reverend Mother, I just wanted to congratulate you.
Oh?
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
Yeah.  Sister Mary Pat was discussing it.  You know she thinks it's a sin.
I think I hear it!
LET THY SPIRIT
Yes, Mary?
Okay, Christy -- strip.
What?
What did who say?
And to say you're sorry.  About this afternoon.  And the things you said. Forgotten.  Completely.  Do you understand?  Forgotten.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
Why?
Mary Patrick -- do you remember the Dixie Cups?
MY SOUL WAS IN DANGER I'D FALLEN FROM GRACE
Like this place?
Soprano or alto?
Very nice.  Sisters, have we learned our lesson?  I won't hold this little episode against anyone.  I'll try not to.
Yeah, for one second.  That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  Be a group.
Right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
Amateurs 2
Hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  Why do I suddenly feel like Snow White?
She says I should wait.  She says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  She says that I'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  In a mature manner.
Well, then there's only one thing to do.
What?
We must do this sacred thing, Mary Robert.
I can't wait to tell Reverend Mother about all my experiences.  I've learned so much.
It's contraband.  Don't ask.  But I wanted to give you a treat.  A sort of... thank-you gift.
The Council of Cardinals!  I'm so nervous!  What if I forget the words?
I WAS DOWNHEARTED
Mother Theresa.  Gandhi.  Don't you understand?  This is all a mistake.  I'm the good guy.  I'm the witness.  And I'm being punished!
Beats me!  What do you think?  Smoking! Heavy petting, without a chaperone. Heavy petting, with the chaperone.  And wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  The demon bra.
I see.
Sit down.
Miss Van Cartier.
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
Are you talking about me?
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
My what?
Our lives are simple.  We have little need for material possessions.
Oh, I don't know... Satan?
It is nine p.m.  Pleasant dreams.
This is a convent, not a clinic.  We offer moral guidance, not hardware.
A decent life?  Excuse me?  As what?  A janitor?
You may stay.  But I shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
What?
Then I guess you're stuck.  Life sentence.  No parole.
He's a businessman.
I don't know anything about bodies!  I mean, he didn't bring it home.  He was good to me... sometimes.  He was sweet. He took care of me.  Who am I supposed to go out with?  He owns a casino.  He let me sing.
Ten flights?
Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
Well..  thanks.  I've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  I mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  I mean, sometimes I feel like... a nun.
Eddie -- I've got to go back.  They won't sing without me.  I'm deserting them.
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
He's so damn cocky.  This is different.
It's done?
Bless her!  There are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  That's why many of us became nuns.  It's marvelous, Reverend Mother.
We did it!  We actually sang a chord!
An... entertainer?
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be?
Bring Young Masbath here.
Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity.
Wallowing in sin and lust...
They need guidance.
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Taken.  Taken by the Headless Horseman.  Taken back to hell.
I could determine if he were dead <u>before</u> he went into the Hudson.
Even though I have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?
More than enough, actually.  I beg you, no more, please.
And now Jonathan Masbath.
We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson.
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Where are we going?
Father said witches live there.
What is it?
We should go.
What good is this?
In test... what?
What was she doing?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
What books?
Why... why are you like this?
This is farewell.
Lady Van Tassel...
Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day.
Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat.
Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it.
If you want.  But...
The things I said to you before... I was wrong to say them.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize...
She has taken the last of our grain to be milled.  You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable?
The Horseman.  Yes.
Lay still, Ichabod.  Do not move.
Go home.
No.
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
Scooter, did I tell about the two old boys pissin' off the bridge?
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
They give me fifty dollars when they turned me loose. I spent up some of it on ridin' the bus and eatin' french-fried potaters.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
How much you want fer 'em? I'll get some of them I reckon.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
How'd your baptizin' go?
I ain't sure.
Stop it, Doyle!
Stop it, Doyle! Don't talk about daddy, you hear me!
Sure, I guess.
You like that Vaughan?
I'd better go on home now, it's late. I have to work tomorrow.
I bet you like sittin' between two men in a dual wheel truck don't you?
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
A good deal of it, I reckon. Can't understand all of it.
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
Different ones. One's the Bible. One of 'ems a book on Christmas. One of 'ems how to be a carpenter.
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I growed up and got taught it ain't right to kill nobody.
I don't see how you can eat that stuff with all those insides it's made out of.
Yeah, me too.  That was nice of that woman to give you them flowers.
Yeah, I recollect it.
I ain't got no money to get 'em with but I bet Vaughan will let me have some of them flowers at the store.
I usually get run off by her mama or daddy if they're home. Reckon why they don't like me?
Just 'cause I'm not rich don't mean I don't love her.
Naw.
That's real good. You ort not to if ye ain't married to somebody. Bible tells you that much. Hit tells some things that don't seem right too, I reckon. I guess a feller ort to foller it close as he can, though.  You don't touch yourself, do you?
Naw.
I didn't mean to say anything bad about you. I know you're good. You didn't mean no harm.  Did you ever think about killin' yourself on purpose like my daddy did?
Yeah.
I knowed you'd be here.  What are you a-doin' digging with that stob?
I care for you, too. But you'll be around, don't say that.
I aim fer you to have 'em.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Yes sir.
Like something different. I don't know.  You're leavin' ain't you, Karl?
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
Huh?
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
Yes ma'am, I reckon.
You walk fast, don't you?
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to looking at pretty people.
Yes, I guess you are.
I ain't got nothing but them books.
I know, I've seen it myself. Would you give that a try?
I can't promise he'll hire you. I'll have to tell him about your history.
She's talkin' about me, Karl. That's my first name.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Why are you here now?
What's wrong? Is everything okay?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Will he be supervised?
Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
What!
And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
Not an easy book.
I'll tell you all about it...  ... but not here.
Uh ... actually, it might be better if you read the story first. Call me when you're finished, okay?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
I mean, you're going too fast. You're hardly even looking at the pictures.
I'm thinking about the kid. I'm sure he'd do a good job for you.
He's got something to tell you, Auggie.
You haven't heard from Rashid, have you?
Nice machine, Auggie. Where'd you find it?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Fine.  Or it was until a couple of days ago. A guy from The New York Times called and asked me to write a Christmas story. They want to publish it on Christmas Day.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
So. Are we ready?
Ready. Any time you are.
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
And you think it looks better to go around dressed up like Captain Hook?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Who the hell knows?  He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
Nice try, old girl. I'd like to help you out. You know, for old time's sake. But all my spare cash is tied up in a business venture, and I haven't collected my profits yet. Too bad. You caught me at the wrong time.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
So you're just going to give up and go home?
No you're not.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
Bully for you.
It's all set. My guy in Miami said he'd have them within the next few weeks.  Are you sure you don't want to go in with me? Five thousand dollars outlay, a guaranteed ten-thousand-dollar return. A consortium of Court Street lawyers and judges. They're just drooling to get their lips around some genuine Cuban cigars.
A job?  I definitely wouldn't turn down a job.
Sure, Auggie, I got it.  The store's closed.  And when do I tell them it's open?
And how much are these?
And these?
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
Why don't you pick some other spot? It gives a man the creeps to be stared at all morning.
Benefits?
And this one, in case you haven't guessed, is Junior.
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
I'll tell you why they're not going anywhere.
Yeah? And why is that?
No harm done. Everything's okay now.  I've got to be going.
It's okay, mister. No big deal.
That's okay. I've already had lunch.
Uh-huh. One of those cozy bed and breakfast places, probably.
Eight-thirty?
I wanted to give you this as a token of my appreciation.
Where did you get that thing?
You don't really want to know.
Let's not get too idealistic.
Ah, coffee. Smells good.
If I tell you, I might not be able to finish it.
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
It's 1942, right? And he's caught in Leningrad during the siege. I'm talking about one of the worst moments in human history. Five hundred thousand people died in that one place, and there's Bakhtin, holed up in an apartment, expecting to be killed any day. He has plenty of tobacco, but no paper to roll it in. So he takes the pages of a manuscript he's been working on for ten years and tears them up to roll his cigarettes.
Not exactly. I mean, there was more to it than I told you.
And started to run.
That's it. In a nutshell.
No way. There's no way I'm giving that money back. It's my money now.
Cuban cigars. You mean he had some hanky-panky going with those guys?
I'm serious, all right. You've got to square it with Auggie. Since you won't give the money back to the Creeper, you can use it to make things right with Auggie. That's probably better anyway. Better to keep your friends than to worry about your enemies.
I'm not going to do it.
Hi, kid.
Yeah, give him another one. And I'll take a cup of coffee while you're at it.
I am a bastard.  I'm a big Hun Nazi son of a bitch.  And I still got your bamboo fishing rod.
That's obvious.
I told myself that was good.  That it made our friendship special.  And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
They only arrested that poor soul because he's Japanese.
Well, what then, sergeant?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
Objection.  Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
<u>Were</u> you, sir?  Can you <u>prove</u> one word of all your fancy story?
But Carl was a fisherman.  And successful at it.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
You have the night watch?  On the radio.
I did.  Boy.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Your daddy.  Was quite a feller.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
You think so?
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
We don't let go, you s...
I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai.
No spare.
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
He was heavy, but we were real careful.  But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
What else could it be?
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Well, the soldiers we've got now, they've been through all kinds of heavy shit...and they've always got the job done.  Now these new ones, these "hot shots" of yours...what kind of action have they seen?  They <u>are</u> battle-tested, aren't they?
Yes.  And that one, too.
I suppose you want a tip?
No --- how does it go?
I mean, we get paid tonight, don't we?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
Of course I am.
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
But suppose he loses?
Greased Lightning!  Why do I listen to you? I ought to have my head examined!
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
We didn't see anything -  - did we?
I feel so naked.  Like everybody's looking at me.
It's no use.  We'll never get away with it, Joe.
I changed it.  It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
What are you doing?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
I'm tired of being a flag.  I want to be a bull again.  Lets get out of here, Joe. Let's blow.
You promised - the minute we hit Florida, we were going to beat it.
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
All right, all right!  But how long can we keep this up?
You - you -
No.  I'm going to be on that boat with Sugar.
That's right.
What are you doing with my flowers?
Like what?
Telephone call?  Who's got time for that?
We'll walk.  And if we have to, we'll starve.
Elope?  But there are laws - conventions -
She sings, too.
I wanted to thank you for covering for me. You're a real pal.
If there's anything I can do for you -
I'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep.
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not that sick.
You got some?
I may spill something.
You should have seen me before I went on a diet.
What's that?
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
His yacht?
Well, I'll be - !   How about that guy?
If I'd been watching my step, I never would have met him.  Wait till I tell Josephine.
Josephine -
I guess she's not in here.
How did you get that bracelet?
We could pass for that.
Hello, Mr. Morris? This is Poliakoff, in Chicago. Say, you wouldn't have a couple of girl musicians available? A sax player and a base?
Help yourself.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
But it's such a waste - a full moon - an empty yacht -
About that roadhouse -
We can have it altered.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Just the two of you?  What about the crew?
What's the job?
Hey, Sig - can we talk to you?
No, we couldn't!
Well, here we are.
No - funerals.
Where did he conduct?
Sugar, you're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble.
If Bienstock catches you again - What's the matter with you, anyway?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
Especially tenor sax.  I don't know what it is, but they just curdle me.  All they have to do is play eight bars of "Come to Me My Melancholy Baby" - and my spine turns to custard, and I get goose-pimply all over - and I come to them.
You know - I play tenor sax.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
About what?
I might as well stay in there. I won't be able to sleep anyway.
Not very likely.
No, my flag steward.
No, my cocktail steward.  Look, if you're interested in whether I'm married or not -
Well, I'm not.
Up, up, up.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
I beg your pardon?
Why?
One of whom?
Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
Thank you.  And thank you for the flowers.
Down the hatch - as we say at sea.
You know, I've never been completely alone with a man before - in the middle of the night - in the middle of the ocean.
Harmless - how?
I don't want to bore you.
I never knew it could be like this.
Oh, of course.  I understand.  At least, I think I do.
Well, anchors aweigh, you have a bon voyage.  And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding, we'll be through here in a couple of weeks.
Where are they holding the wake? I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Mozarella?  Never heard of him.
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
You and who else?
Why wouldn't I?
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Oh, shut up and be happy. It’s always this or that. You’re never happy, you frowny-faced Grumplestilskin.
I don’t think I can go through with this.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
I’m an American and in America, people sue. So to prevent a lawsuit, I baked a tart. And I don’t bake.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
Who’s ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
Just because some slag’s been paid for, doesn’t mean you’ve got to...you know.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
Mission accomplished.
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
What does your gut say?
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
I love that you’re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
When I said I’d never done a wedding before, I didn’t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
I should go.
Kat Ellis! We live two hundred miles away from each other but I have to fly all the way to London to see you. You haven’t visited me once in D.C. Where the hell have you been? I have gynecologists that call more often.
Oh, no. He told you.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Hi, kiddo.
Yeah.
I’m guessing MacCallum, 18 years.  Neat, with a water-back.
You don't live around here, do you?
What he talk 'bout?
Well, how did you like the class, David?
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
David Lee...
You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
He'll show up one day.
David!
Who's winning, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
What's that you carryin'?
She is, Mama...  When the fall comes, she wants me to come to her school.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's about the Three Musketeers.
When you read it we'll talk about it...
Would you like to have a cool drink, David?
I guess so -- but I went home and did me some praying to the Lord. I said, Lord, I went into this white church down in Row and all I want you to tell me is how I ever got outta there in one piece.
Well, let me have it.
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
Dude, she's eight years old, just get her some ice cream or something.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Why the fuck not?
About what?
Cartman! What the hell are you talking about?! You LOVE Terrance and Philiip!
More people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
Your behind?
CARTMAN!
Mom... When is the war gonna be over?
Ugh... You guys, seriously... I'm having Cheesy Poof withdrawal...
What? Fuck French people. Fuck 'em in the ear.
You get me Cheesy Poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and I'll watch my fucking mouth!
I don't know.
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Gwpaapa. Gwpaapa.
It's so very cold...
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Wow!
Thank you, Kenny.
Mom, I'm a man. Just a man. And I'm going to have fun with profanity just like you and dad did when you were little.
Sheila, you're going to far! Those are YOUR children!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?! We need to stop the not pretty things from letting our children be born in hospitals!
Oh, uh...  I don't know if air strikes are necessary.
And Bill?
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Terrance and Phillip MOVIE?! Oy gevalt! Not again!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
<b>Shut your fucking face, Unclefucka!! You're an asslicking, Ball sucking Unclefucka!! You're an Unclefucka, yes it's true Nobody fucks Uncles quite like you-</b>
Listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
You know I do.
What if I just left?
Help you? You've destroyed my life and now you want me to help you?!  You're always making me feel like a piece of shit.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
Ow, you're hurting me!
I never though I'd be stuck in a wine closet with Warren Wayne.
Anna Koros. She sensually extends her hand, Warren shakes it -
Of course, of course...
Were you going to give it to them?
On channel 10?
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
It's telling me fail mode confirmed.  Did you see this?
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
I don't know.  Everything's up in the air at this point, no pun intended.
Barnes, can you hear me, are you all right?
It's still not going to work! They'll detect you upon re-entry in an emergency vessel!
That was a joke Taylor, lighten up!  Why don't you just hold them up to the lens.  I'll write them down, and once I'm through verifying them, I'll get back to you.
Seems like they're cooperating. Hopefully I'll be out of here and on my way very soon.
It's time we lock coordinates.
This ship is going down in a blaze of glory!
I told you, I had to teach a few people a lesson!
That's clear.
Well, let me put it this way.  Most of the cost is due to safety reasons. Most people are not familiar with space travel, so we have to take extra precautions in the event they do something careless.
Well I hope I don't do anything careless.
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Everyone just stay put.
I can't let you do that.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Explosive?
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
A schematic of the ship.  Looking for a lifeline to the pods.
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I'm not going with you.
In that case, I accept.
Is there anything I can help you with?
So I've been told.
We should have gone to Nassau. At least we could go swimming, lie on the beach.
Oh no...I think there's carrots in here...
You're gonna give him those bank codes, you know why?  Because I'm telling you to, that's why.  I'm not losing my life over some greedy pig.
Because, Taylor wouldn't do that, that's why.
Certainly.  If you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
How is it looking, Mac?
I'm an addict. I can't go through a day without the stuff. Theo reaches over and pours for him with a steady hand.
Paradise, huh? Might be one of the new putt-putts off route 99. Theo turns to leave.
I remember, Sid! Mr. Kastle says he don't like no sticky fingers in the till.
I hate fuckin' opera.
How do you know, you don't even speak Latin?
Bowling was the most incorruptible sport. No megalomillionaires, no 
Theo.
They suspended me for 100 years.
100 years! 
It's mine.
Who gave it to you?
I don't know no Grace Skinner.
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
I gotta survive.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
Uh...over easy.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
He's not here.
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
Here Theo, it's the Fazeli specialty; a seven-ten split. Theo looks down the lane and sees the two pins standing.
Business.
Isn't this technically a scooter?
Kinda tough on the butt.
I'd rather you didn't.
Theo, what would you do if you couldn't bowl?
What's plan B?
So why do you stay?
I could let them go for ten.
Yeah, what did Buzz Fazeli ever do for you?
Nothing.
I'm afraid you'll hurt him.
Say something, Theo. Give me something. A doll's legs catch fire. Theo stares into Sheila's eyes.
Theo, Buzz is dead.
What about plan C?
I'm not here to bowl.
You should probably hit the road. Go home. This place could get hazardous for your health.
The body was identified along proper Bowling Congress guidelines for processing a bowling related fatality.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Fletcher?  What are you doing out there?
How big is this spacecraft?
Wait a minute --
Nice work, Captain sir.
Good.  Security's been our biggest worry.  Now that you're here we can shut this thing down tight.
Then why am I here?
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
Geologists?
-- there's got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  There's no such thing... our space program isn't even forty years old.
It's impossible.
Picked up something?  What is it?
You mean, what's in that thing is immortal?
I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us.
You can't just leave Harry down here, sir.
A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university.  She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  She was also living with him.  Yeah, I know.  And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
'81, I think.  She tried again five years ago.  I thought you should know.
Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons.
... it raises a very serious question: <u>What happens if Jerry</u> <u>gets mad</u>?
What the hell?  It shut us down.
To the craft?  None.  Not a scratch.
I did.
Yes, Harry.
Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
To what?
What sub?
Beth, look, can I trust you with a little secret?
It's bullshit.  The report's a joke.
To the spacecraft.  To investigate.
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
The library.
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
Yeah, why?
Beth.
Yeah, he <u>told</u> you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
You went through Edmunds' things?
Don't tell me to calm down!
Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman.
Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me.
Fixing it.
We must've had it delivered then.
When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere.
But how?
It's for motion sickness.
Valdomet.
Antihistamine.  For bites.
Beth --
For what?
The grooves around the door -- they've shifted.  And the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
No, he can't.
Someone did.
You're lying --
And the snakes?  You want to know about the snakes?  You saw one outside earlier, didn't you?  When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
You manifested that, Beth.
Yes.
Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry.
Don't, Beth.
It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage.
I don't get it.
Is it coming from our own computer?
I don't follow you.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I could never read that far.  I never wanted to.
There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute.
But why would she -- ?
Navy transmission.  They're sent from Wisconsin.
What is it?
Three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
What'd you say to him?
What is it, Harry?
An American spacecraft?  Half a mile long?  And buried 400 years?  Yeah, good theory, Harry.
It didn't fly here.  It <u>arrived</u> here.
Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
Good idea, Ted.
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
It's over, sir, The storm has cleared.
That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier...
You mean you don't know?
You want me to try?
He's manic, Norman.  You know that? This reliance on Harry is misplaced. You hear me?  Totally misplaced.  He's overlooking things.  Obvious things.
Squint harder.
Frankly, Ted, I'd be much happier if Jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
We have to find he rebels... What we're carrying belongs to them.
No, not anymore.
I think there are some things we should talk about.
Don't look at me.  I'm just a pilot. I got you here... You've got to do the rest.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
But the Sith Lords are involved! Whatever information this R-2 unit is carrying, it must be awfully important.  They're probably looking for him... I'm no match for the Sith. This is a Jedi's work.  This is your responsibility!
I had one, but it was taken at the battle of Condawn...
That's where my father was killed.
But you always said things were so great at the academy... What happened?
Blue Five, does that glare bother you?
Alert squad five, but hold them until we know what it is.
Yes, your highness. I'll let you open it then.  It won't be too long before they figure out what happened to us.  This has turned into a brilliant escape!
What about us?  Are we to wait forever?  Is our reward to be blown to bits on this forsaken system, while your fleet mounts some suicidal attack on that Death Star? Part of my reward is that I be around to spend it.
This isn't going to work.
Why didn't you say so before.
It's only light that doesn't affect it.  Solid things, like rocks, can hurt it!  Fire above him!
Get to the ship!
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Tell me where you've been.  I am going to become a startrooper and fight in the wars.  My father was a Jedi!  Were you in many battles?
Something... I've got...you don't.
Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character in Buenos Aires...
Jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
Sir, no, sir.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Did you read her mind ?
Your father will never let you.
Everyone is going to the dance. Aren't you ?
Well, whad'ya know...
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
There's a war on. I want a command, I want my own ship, you do, too...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
He's nothing like you.
He was in the group with me. I guess he didn't...
Poor boy. I'm sorry your parents were so mad.
What happened to your hair ?
You look so... I don't know, you look like you've really been in it.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA !
Where'd it come from ?
What ?
No thanks, Diz.
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Take your group down to P and have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That's not your job.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Well, yeah, sure...
Don't get any ideas. She's my girl.
Alright, we're gonna carry you...
This is Rodger Young... What's going on down there ? We're taking plasma ! We have Orion P-11 as clear !
The examination is a normal function.
What does that mean?
You are what...?
Explanation, Mr. Decker: Why was my phaser order countermanded?
Negative control from inertial lag will continue 22 point five seconds before forward velocity slows to sub-light speed.
If I'd seen you again, would you have been able to say it?
And in you, too, Lieutenant.
Mr. Spock?
Maneuvering thrusters, Mister Sulu.
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
We're already two settings below that, sir.
Viewer ahead.
Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu; ahead one third.  Full sensor scan, Mr. Spock; they can't expect us <U>not</U> to look them over now!
Hold station...!
We're losing the pattern...!
Reporting as ordered, Captain.
Recommend we proceede, Captain.
We cannot break free, Captain.  We do not have a fraction of the power necessary.
They had a pattern to follow...
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
These read as identical composition...  ... however, Captain, they measure several hundred times more powerful!
... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?
To you, sir?
Starfleet signals, sir, growing in strength...  They -- have Intruder on their monitors -- it's decelerating -- powerfield cloud beginning to dissipate...
Nope.
You bringing your new friend?
The people in New Hampshire.
Well, it had sentimental value.
Why?
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  But...do you see?
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Hello.
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
Paperclip?
Fix my glasses.
It's for your finger.
"To the love of my life, Love, Doug"?
Then I'll come back, then.
You can do it.
But it's absurd.
I can't get it to come out right.
Ah.  Ah.  Ah...
That's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. Take...
Yessuh.  Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
How's your star?
Press still works.
That's something a man could do...?
Pelting down out there.
I've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
Well, I could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
What are you going to do?
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll <u>be</u> waiting.
I'm glad you asked...I'll <u>tell</u> you what was wrong with it.  And what was wrong with it was it was behind the times. Now:  You want to bring <u>business</u> into this town?  You have to plan for a Waterford that Does Not Exist.  Not at the moment, <u>no</u>...
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
I've been thinking.
I'm sorry.
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
I will.
Then she wasn't in the car.  <u>Say</u> it.
Whyn't you learn your lines?
Bourbon and Milk.
Tell it with pictures.  What I'm saying...
What...
<u>Bobby</u>...
So you see what I'm <u>saying</u>...the movie is about <u>purity</u>...
You do...?
Nobody touched me, I was at home.
Look.
Yes, but, Joe, <u>Joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "Thoughts," about...
Yes, yes, but...
I...I...
...I can't do it, Wally...
What?  I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
He treated me as if I were a child...
He's staying here?  Bob Barrenger is staying he...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Where you off to?
Doug...
He should be put in jail.
Who's White...?
I...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Does it have to be an Old Mill?  Where have you been?
We're out of money.
I don't drink.
So be it.
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
What is that...?
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
They're coming Fedex...
My undies, cause, you can't get this picture off on time I'm gonna' wet myself.
<u>Pay</u> her.
He's got a gift for fiction.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
...we need the shooting permit for Main Street...
You hear that?
I don't care.
I hate when you say that.
I'm not upset.  Why would I be upset?
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
She is only the <u>Princess</u> of Cool. <u>Mommy</u> is the Queen!
And what do you do wh...
Annabelle...wake up honey...
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
Yes.
The timing was off -- I need this light.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
Now Ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  And the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
I hate her.  I really hate her.
Cos she loves you.
Are you <u>real</u> mad?
What honey?
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
I did.  Do I have to eat lamb? Daddy didn't cook it, she did.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Where Ben?
Ben.  God doesn't like visitors.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Which part of no don't you understand?
Napalm.
Thank you Mrs. Franklin.  Jackie?  This has been very valuable for us.  And I'll have a serious talk with Annabelle tonight.
I'm worried.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend...  ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Easy enough.
Our children.
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one.  I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I'm seeing a lawyer.
Remember when Mommy and Daddy got divorced?
I know.  I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you.
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
Machines do not EAT message.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
I don't know wh...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
And her...?
And I'm going to win.
You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>!
You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth.
Why didn't I?
You'll learn.
Uh-oh.  I mention marriage, all of a sudden...  Ve <u>haff</u> to ta...
We have the kids.  Next weekend.
Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
Well, they will be.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Can we go sit somewhere?
'...I don't know if I can make it.' That's what I said.  But I didn't leave.
What?
There are some rumors...
Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
But I thought he came over to America before the war.
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Welcome to the show, Scooby.
Four brothers and five sisters.
It was God's will.
I'm still poor.
I'm always working.
How did they execute him?
I am sure.
Why was he on Death Row?
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
Fine.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
Scooby?
OK.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
Good.  'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Fuck me hard!
None at all? How about those 'underground' comics?
All right, Scooby, let's not beat around the bush. With your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
Great!
Oh, no, not any more. No, um, I kind of came to terms with myself, I realized I had done what I had to do. And it was time to move on.
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Yeah. But not any more.
How many?
You want some?
You a pervert?
Doubt it.
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Can I see what you have so far?
Twenty-five-million!  And what will they do if the money isn't delivered?
I'm going first.  Taking the fire. If we go out together we're all dead!
What are you talking about?
I have a lighter!
Are the labs in operation?
How's the arm?
Good.
Where the hell could they have gone!
Gotcha.  We've been filling barrels all day--we've got  hell of a stockpile.
Are we adrift--
War-mongering bully!  Don't think you're going to intimidate me!
What's the meaning of this?
Well, it has been explained to me that, if you add a thick Cobalt-Thorium-G jacket to a nuclear device, the radio- activity resulting from such a nuclear explosion will retain its lethal power for a hundred years.
Where is this...thing?
This dreadful accident could never have happened if your government hadn't cynically and hypocritic- ally blocked every proposal we made for disarmament or arms control!!
That's nonsense, and you know it!
Mister President, I can't buy this malarkey; they wouldn't set the damn thing off.  Why should they?
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
The three-letter code group.  Or maybe some combination of the three letters. P...O...E, or P...E...O, or E...O...P... let's see, there would be six possible combinations.
Look, Colonel.  I've got to talk to somebody at Air Command.
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
What kind of trouble?
I want him upped to Brigadier General, and recomended for the D.S.C.
That's right.  I want this flashed to all section immediately.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
General Ripper, if I shut down the communi- cations center, there'll be no radio or teleprinter contact with Air Command head- quarters or anyone, for that matter.
Please don't take any notice of this weapon, Major.  I love all weapons, and as of late, I've just taken to keeping a loaded weapon nearby at all times.
Certainly, Major Mandrake.  You're a good officer, and you can ask me a question any time you want to.
Well, sir, I was thinking, if an enemy attack is in progress, how come the radio's still playing music?  It's supposed to go off, and all we should hear are Civil Defense broadcasts.
Well, I was thinking, maybe an enemy attack is not in progress?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
I see.
I guess so.
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
I've heard the arguments.  Like Napoleon's quote, "There's one thing you can't do with a bayonet, and that's - sit on it."
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
Mister President, I know you think I've let you down, but we had to have a Plan-R.  If we completely centralized the command and control, all a potential aggressor would have to worry about was knock- ing out maybe half a dozen headquarters and the Capitol, and we'd be out of business. We'd have planes and missiles just sitting there while we were getting clobbered.
Have you received acknowledgements from every plane?
I'm not certain, Mister President.  But I believe it was four.
He says they've only shot down three planes.
Look, he's there, and you're here.
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
Maximum ECM.
Speed?
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
So am I.
Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
Where'd they get you?
You tell me.
Look, this is different.
Lieutentant Zogg, how would you like your black butt slung into a General Court Martial when we get back???
There are plenty of traitors and spies running around loose.
Well, I can't get out and look, King.  But I don't get a green light.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Um-hm.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
In Group?
Intense.
Typical male.
Oh. Well, what's it on?
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
I'm saying no, I'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
No. Life is too short.
Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
What?
No.
Oh, you were in the band?
Buff.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
He paid you man.
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
We're your customers. We're not complaining.
Hey, call the cops! Call 'em, call 'em right now, man. Maybe my cousin Jerry will show up. He'll definitely take your word over mine. You can tell him about the trespassing. I'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
You stand someplace else, man. You stand someplace else. This is our corner. You don't fucking own it!
See, I wrote something about all this. Uh, it, it's a song about...
You okay, man? You okay?
Okay.
Yes.
He is.
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
A Porsche.
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
Really?
You cut off your little finger?
No, no, see, you, you don't understand.
Great.  Hi. I'm Erica.
If it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh no, no. You know what? Fuck that. No, you lied to me. You lied to me because you're gutless. You're a gutless, drunken looser.
You don't know?
You know, this, what you're doing with your life...
Look, why do you care, huh?
You could've come over.
I hate that.
Oh, well, then you better listen to him.
About things that are important to me.
Like what?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
It got that close.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
But wait! Sooze, I don't wanna fight. I'm so sorry.
What?
And I fig- and I figured something out.
Wait, Sooze, I, I have to talk to you, 'cause I, there's something I figured out.
To his hotel?
'Bye, Jeff.
Go.
Hey, the driver knows Billy Idol. Wow, huh?
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, really.
So, um, Pony, where are you staying? Are you staying at your mother's house?
Oh, no, man, look. Look, you know, it's me, okay? I come out here and I'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and I think I'm a fucking star, man, and I'm really sorry if I'm full of attitude. I, I really...
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
Get off my roof!
No, no, she went up by herself. This was not my responsibility.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah?
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
I think about you. I mean, a lot.
Me?
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
The bar at the hotel? She told you that? What did she say exactly?
Hey, great game Friday. Kicked Holbrook's ass, huh?
Oh yes! Yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' Pony ride back to the hotel.
The fuck not?
Holy shit.
Forget it.  I've got a scholarship to Harvard hanging over my head.  I won't risk it.
Can you guys believe this?  We're like celebrities!
Is Jack upset that he can't be here?
Oh... What are you working on?
"No" you're not sure or "No" I'm not fat?
Stop, you're gonna make me cry.
It's all my fault.  I'm sorry I ever started this...
Remember, Kansas, every time you point a finger you've got three more pointing back at you.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
Don't use big bills!
Hello?
No.  This is Diane.  I think you have the wrong number.
Are you girls talking about boys? Practicing kissing your hands?
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Oh please, we've all got bright futures ahead of us - we're not going to tell anyone.  Promise!
Wait a minute.  You watched the Apple fucking-Dumpling Gang?!
Don't make me Jerry Lewis you guys for the rest.
Okay, you can't tell anybody.
Oh, Jesus Christ, Mom!  Like my life ain't a great big pile-of-shit 'cause you're in here?  Now I have to add, "P.S. My mom's a dyke" too?
Diane, it says here you're going to have mood swings, uncontrollable gas.
I didn't mean to --
I hear she was a terror to work with.
Roll 'em.
In a deep freeze.
Sure, this'll go on all night.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
This is Miss Kramer.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Why, you sweet kid.
You won't.  I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it.
Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec.
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write.
What about all those ideas you had?
Sorry.  It's your baby now.
What has Artie to do with it.
From Artie.  What's wrong?
This is where you live?
Hers.
Just look around.  There's a lot of her spread about.  If you don't remember the face, you must have heard the name of Norma Desmond.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
Hello, young fellow.
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Nothing.  I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  I had no idea how I'd missed it.
Get out.
I know your face.  You're Norma Desmond.  You used to be in pictures.  You used to be big.
Ssh! You'll wake up that monkey.
And you'll play Salome?
Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback.
They'll love it in Pomona.
Of course it is.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters.  We won't keep books.  Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Just a scene I cut out.
Cut away from me?
Now what is it?  Where's the fire?
I don't need a tuxedo.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
Not on the same floor with Valentino!
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
What are the notes?
Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough.
Keep it.
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
Did she read the script?
When did he say it, Norma?
You'd better get to bed yourself.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
I haven't done anything, Norma.
That's a lie!  They still want me!
Norma, grow up.  You're a woman of fifty.  There's nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
Goodbye.  Norma.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
I'm talking to you.  My clothes and things are up in the room.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I directed all her early pictures. There were three young directors who showed promise in those days: D.W. Grirrith, C.B. deMille, and Max von Mayerling.
Sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  That car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there's going to be fireworks.
So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh?
Could I?  Gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  So I borrowed money from the bank so I could pay for the ranch.  This year I had to mortgage the ranch so I could keep up my life insurance so I could borrow on the insurance so I could pay my income tax.  Now if Dewey had been elected -
If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
What is the scene? Where am I?
You and your husband have been kind to me, Alura. I have something to tell you: I'm going away. Soon.
It couldn't be helped. The city will have to make do with three.
No way. I'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
I used to work here summers when I was a kid.
Is this how?
I thought I'd show you one of my favourite places.
Hello. Are you still mad at me?
I don't see why not.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
You've had your fun, Selena, the game is over.
She's right. They'll string her up.
Finished your estimate?
What's that big black scar on the ground? Like a fire.
You're a regular Einstein, aren't you?
Why the empty cage?
Why George, are you proposing?
Oh, no thanks.
Yes.
Jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
But Kara, no one has ever gone from here to Earth. The journey is dangerous.
Superman will return it.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Why is he acting so strangely?
I just did. Because I have the Power.
You used to listen to me. When you asked me to teach you something of the Craft.
I'm free. I can never thank you enough.
Ever since I found that thing I've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. You have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
What's it like?
This is the Phantom Zone. But why did you come here from Argo City?
Zaltar, please help me.
You can use the wand.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Yeah? What do you want?
What?
I just think Ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
Lana Lang. How great to see you.
I can't  Clark already asked me.  Didn't you?  He used to love this song.  Didn't you?  So he just said --  "Would you dance with me?"
It sure is.
Too much mayonnaise?
I didn't --
But Lana, you could --
There's a lot of choices here.
That's the biggest change in Smallville, you know. They've taken over this town. Everybody who isn't actually working for Wheat King -- like I do -- is out there --  on a Wheat King thresher.  Do you think I could do it? Do you?
No, well in this case I think I can speak for him.  I mean, I'm pretty close to him, you know.  Superman will be there on Wednesday.
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
The thing is though, my cousin Arnold, Aunt Rosey's Arnold this is, he got mad when Uncle Al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Nope, but --
Well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen Japanese jobs.
No, not really. They can't be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
Workin' overtime? What are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
Say, fella, I understand. I can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you're comin' from."  You want to be rich, right?
Uh...
Under different company names. I control the price of coffee beans in Brazil. The price in Venezuela. Java, South Korea, North Korea, the Aleutian Islands, Guam, Bolivia, and the Republic of Gabon!
Columbia.
But Mr. Webster...you're doin' okay with Brazil and them other places. What's wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
Gus, tell me, have you ever heard of Vulcan?
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
It looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
I was afraid you'd say that.  Hey, is there a bus station around here?
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
Oh. I'm Lana Lang. This is Ricky.
The picture looks blurry.
I thought you'd never get here.
No, I don't think I would. So... then what can I do for you?
Why stop at coffee!  A cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
How would you know?
By hand. Like the pioneers did.
It's modern. It's up-to-date. It's state-of-the art.  People, I am in love with this machine.  Go ahead, Mr. White.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
That's what I want to know! By whom? Whom????
Small potatoes.
Chicken feed.  If Gus Gorman can push the right buttons ---
Nice try, Butch,  but it wouldn't be effective against Superman.  You'll see! Now that he's pulled this stunt, he'll stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I've got to get rid of him! I've got to!
Wait a minute! She's right! Kryptonite. I remember reading about it in an interview with him.  Nuts...
I do?
Actually, yes.
Really?
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
I'm sorry.
Lois, someday --
You do?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Gee. But --
A parka.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
I like trees.
Good. My heart can't take it.
You no longer can serve humanity if you invest your time and emotion in one of them at the expense of the rest.  Surely this is not how you repay their gratitude, Kal-El. Could you really abandon the weak and the needy merely to fulfill some selfish dream.
Yes, but it's not all I feel.
Ahhhhhh -- Alpha Waves.
Oh, General, the world is a big place. Thank goodness, my needs are small...As  it turns out, I have this affinity for beachfront property . . .
So --  I hope you like it.
Perhaps there is some good in you after all, Lex Luthor.
I knew you'd double-cross me, Luthor. A lying weasel like you couldn't resist the chance . . .
Put down Lex Luthor !
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
Who is this imbecile? Where is he?
But you're perfect for it. You're young, you're single, you're successful...
That sounds kind of pessimistic.
That tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
. . . Please leave your message at the beep.
And what do we get out of it?
Lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
Because I made a vow. Never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
I'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
Where's Clark?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
He missed the door, Uncle Lex.
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
What I need this for?
Nice bit. You're good. With my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. I could be . . . Emperor, King! Did you see how scared those guys were?
It's common knowledge you hate children and animals. Why are you back in Metropolis?
Your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, Luthor.
Which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
Yes, so, well, Werner would've gotten to that too but  --  --  but the XK101 flies only eight feet above the ground...well below the radar limit!  So what? We could have done that soon. We had ways to make people ta-- ways to avoid the radar. And this XK101  -- they think it's so smart that they keep it in 'missile silos' underground. Hah!  We kept many things underground.
One of them should've been you.
You'd better get a new alarm clock. The chief has been hollering for you.
I've been on the job.
Clark...Son...that...thing you did with the Sheriff today... those...stunts...you don't do those things at school, do you?
Mom...
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Stop him, Clark!
There's no real proof that tobacco  --
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
Why would he do that? How would he know I was going to suddenly slip.
Jealous? Of what?
Sure, and let the plane crash in the middle of the city.
It isn't a Park Avenue address. really.
Streets, Sunlight. When was the last time I saw sunlight.
Fifty degrees below and still falling.
Krypton!
Oh. Why? does he live up here?
You got wax in your ears?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Gets you where you live, huh?
What's your name, boy?
Folks'll ask question.
He will be odd, different.
Enjoyed it?
My son, I foresaw this. I knew -
How good it felt!
Lois, the kickback story...
Do as I say. Let go!
Superman???
You think they're strange?
Uh-huh.
Do you like pink?
Now then, Otis. Did you get what I asked for?
Well, gents? What did I tell you? It's a piece of cake.
It would never have worked, Luthor. You are a dreamer  --  a sick, twisted dreamer.
I'm fine.  Still working with my father.
Ally Jones.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Which clinic?
Alison.
Case?
Hi, Nicole.
I'll be back around nine.
I used to like it here.  I used to care about what happened.  Now I think I'll sell my house and move the fuck away.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses?  That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
About the Ottos?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus.  They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
From what?
You talked about it?
Were his parents...attentive to him?
Yes.  He does.
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole.  He looked frightened.
Why would he be frightened?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
Your Dad spent all his spare time in here.  He wanted to make it absolutely perfect.
What's a ditty again?
Yes.
Well, if he knew magic - if he could get the kids into the mountain - why couldn't he use his pipe to make the people pay him for getting rid of the rats?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
There was nothing reckless in Mrs. Driscoll's behavior?
Note that she said 'pretty clearly'. Not 'clearly'.
Wanda and Hartley.  They lost Bear. He was their adopted son.  A beautiful boy.  Indian.
Yes.
Need a hand?
A car wash!  Wow, I've never talked to you when you've been in a car wash.  Make sure you've got the windows closed.
I'm calling because I've got some news for you, Daddy.  Some big news.
Tell me your news, Zoe.
I need money.
We do.
The Walkers spoke very highly of you.
You've been retained?
About eight-thirty in the morning.
No.  I was alone.  My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
Mrs.  Driscoll was driving too fast? What made you think that, Nicole?
You saw the speedometer?
Pretty slick, eh?
He's a lawyer.  He's our lawyer.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
What do you mean?
But Charlene...
Where are we running?  What am I missing here?
Did she accept?
Excuse me, Steve.  I said namely you shouldn't go around wild, blaming people without justification.
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
That's a lollipop that, boy.  The kid is only great.
See my mother?
Frank, I think maybe you lied to me.
Just exactly what are you so hot about?  I mean, I know it's a difficult thing to be an artist in this crudest of possible worlds, but --
But my day with Susie isn't over yet and--
What a question, dear, with that newspaper in your hand...
Why are you trembling, dear...?
Let me finish, dear.  You had your say, now let me have mine...
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
Susie, I'm sorry if---
Err...the Supreme Court story, I was telling you - Justice Black.
Yeah, I got eyes.  I put things together.
You had something to do for me - you didn't do it.
J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
I'm not sure I can reach him in time.
Can't hurt...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Sidney, I told you -
It's nice, Sidney, that you give me this tip...
I thought he would.
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes?  I called you twice.
Don't tell me you started a polka with Leo Bartha?
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Yeah.  Otis Elwell.  The columnist.
Yeah!
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...?  Where's my other shoe?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I?  A bowl of fruit?  A tangerine that peels in a minute?
What sort of thing?
It isn't.  I've just seen the early edition.
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
The renting agent and the tailor.
So what'll you do if I feel nervous? You'll open your meaty, sympathetic arms...?
I'm used to you...
If that's for me, tear it up!
I put a lotta trust in you, Chickie...
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
It is a favor, isn't it?
Did you now?  On which bounce?
I tried to reach you twice -
Jimmy, I'm on my way inside right now to talk to Hunsecker.  I can promise you -
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted.  He isn't perfect, but -
If the stores are open -
I get the feeling, Falco, that you're always snooping around...
You going to work all day?
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I'm thinking now it's the way I'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
Do you know about the chip?
We should abort.
Holy shit... you're really real!  I mean... whoah!  You're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
Radical.
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Why?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
We're not gonna make it, are we?  People, I mean.
Torque wrench please.
The T-1000 has the same files that I do.  It could anticipate this move and reacquire you at Dyson's house.
No shit?
But it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
I got it.  Piece of cake.
I know!
It has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
You broke my arm!
You look like handmade shit.
My CPU is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  But Skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
Why him?
In three years Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  All stealth bombers are upgraded with Cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  Afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
I have detailed files.
Relax now, Sarah --
You think a whole orchestra, what, a hundred and forty or so guys, could be orchestrated?
What the hell are they doing?
Yeah.
What is this, Emmi?
I have already been cleared by a Denazification Tribunal in Austria.
Goebbels and Goering were sure heaping honours on you. One makes you a Privy Councillor, the other makes you Vice-President of the Chamber of Music, and you weren't even a member of the Party, how do you explain that?
May I ask a question?
Sure.
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
He told me to be careful as one of Goebbels' men was watching me. He read a report on me - everything I said was quoted word by word.
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
Well. Once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.
Come on, admit it. K worried you, didn't he? He always worried you. In 1942, he's thirty-four years old, you're already fifty-six. And Goebbels and Goering keep saying to you, 'If you don't do it, little K will.' Never mind art and politics and symbols and airy-fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because I don't care how great you are. It's the oldest story in the book,  The ageing Romeo jealous of the young buck. The real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the Miracle Kid, the Party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little K.
I have illegitimate children.
Those attitudes do not exist in me.
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Have you ever smelled burning flesh? I smelt it four miles away. Four miles away, I smelt it. Have you ever seen the gas chambers, the crematoria? Have you seen the mounds of rotting corpses? You talk to me about culture, art and music? You putting that in the scales, Wilhelm? You setting culture, art and music against the millions put to death by your pals? They had orchestras in the camps. They played Beethoven, Wagner. The hangmen were playing chamber music at home with their families. I don't understand the Germans' relationship with music. What do you need music for? Your pals you could call to save a few Jews when millions of them were being annihilated? Yes, I blame you for not getting hanged, I blame you for your cowardice. You strutted and swaggered, you fucking piece of shit, king-pin in a shithouse. You talk to me about walking a tightrope between exile and the gallows, and I say to you, lies!
It's Dr. Furtwängler's baton, which I stole.
What?
Was looking at Furtwängler like that?
Then how do you explain him being made a Prussian Privy Councillor?
I had him hooked.  He was just about to ask me out. I could tell.
You're a big help.
Just let me go.
Reese...you got a first name?
What?
I volunteered.
I'm sure.
Ow!  No, it's okay.  It's better tight.
Good field-dressing.
That's not my mission.
I'm dying for a shower.  You could use one too.  And we'd better check that bandage.
I was thinking, there's so much I've got to show you when we get through this. It's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...Disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
Not possible.
He'll find us, won't he?
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
A girl.  You know.
It's better that way.
What are you doing?
With the One Thirty Second under Perry, from '21 to '27--
You go naked.  Something about the field generated by a living organism.  Nothing dead will go.
Okay.  Okay.  But this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
I'm afraid that's not up to me.
I can help you...
I won't.  Now just relax. Where are you?  Yeah, I know it...on Pico. Are you alright?
Sarah.  Sarah, this is Dr. Silber- man.  I'd like you to tell him everything Reese said to you.  Do you feel up to it?
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
That stuff's two hours cold.
I already did.  No answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I'm keeping them there.
If they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  How do I look?
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
I'll be done in a minute.  You misspoke before.  You're not "stepping down."  I'm taking you out at the knees.  The whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  I'm firing you. Action's taken.  Confidence restored. Stock goes up.  I sell my shares.
Did you play recently?
You want to know what it is?  What it's all about?  John.  Chapter nine.  Verse twenty-five.
Clean out your locker.
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
Don't help me, just get more napkins. And soda water.
This can't be real...
Read what it says: "Warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  If elevator stops, use emergency... "
No.
Don't panic.  When security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
Never did catch your name.
Goodnight.
Well... the red bra.
Okay.
What is this!?
How?  How could they have gotten anything?
It's just money.  You should be glad you're alive.
Who's responsible?!
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Stop it!
Originally, Connecticut.
Hey there, Nickie.
This isn't an escort service?
Tell me you'll call.
Just drive, man.  It's fucking nuts!
C.R.S.  Who do you think?  Jesus H., thank your lucky charms.  To think what I almost got you into.
You dodged a bullet.
Slow down, take a breath...
What have they been doing to you?
It's a flat tire.  That's all.
Do you know how to change a tire?
You're part of it...
Where's Christine?  The waitress.
Robbed?
Yes.
Your brother was a client with our London branch.  We do a sort of informal scoring.  His numbers were outstanding.  Sure you're not hungry at all... ? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown...
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
They know you... you worked for them. You can get me in.
What are you gonna do anyway?  You won't get your money back.
I need the police.
I can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested I am.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Show Mr. Van Orton to his room.
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
Was he morose, or...?  I mean...
Goodnight.  See you home.
His behavior... ?
No.
Hey... !
Nicholas...
Just what I told you.
Uh... Nell Vance...
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
Luke, can I talk to you?
Why?
So could you!  Is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
Mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
Are you working with her?
And after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
Does she know that's why you're using her?
The cold sensation.  Who felt it first?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
Someone is playing with you.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
What?
This is where we're going?
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Get a blanket!
Mrs. Dudley.
It's a job.  I keep banker's hours.  I set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  You can serve yourselves.  Breakfast is ready at nine.  I don't wait on people.  I don't stay after dinner.  Not after it begins to get dark.  I leave before dark comes.  We live in town.  Nine miles.  So there won't be anyone around if you need help.  We couldn't even hear you, in the night.
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
I'm between jobs right now.  My last job... it... the person I was working for... the job ended. Over.  So... And you?
A monster?  But he built this for the woman he loved, like the Taj Mahal.
What's his first name?
Well?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
They're all in here.  All the ones he killed.  They're just children! We have to help them!
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
No.  You're not specific enough to be a person.  You're more like a vibe.
It's an observation.  Like:  I'm hungry. When are we eating?
I'm not into finger foods.  Too fussy.
You demand to be served.  A fork fetishist.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
Italian.
Who?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
How'd you like to kill someone for me?
What kind?
I thought he was in prison, in England.
Let him break - he likes to break.
Been to the Boat Show.
That's a high-end item.  Total reliability.
CQ what?
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Told you you wouldn't be able to see through that gate.
Valets, eh?  Aren't we all la-de-da.
I've been wondering something.
Not much -- you?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Not embarrassed.
Modelling.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
I see.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
Depends, don' it.
Tell us about it.
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Did you.  What was that in aid of?
Who remembers.
I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right.
What'd your father do?
You sound like my fucking probation officer.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
How do you know?
Your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I'm here on another matter entirely.
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
It was you.  Downtown.
No, I can reassure you on that point. Valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
As you prefer, squire.  As you prefer.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you.
But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
Something's on.
"He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who <u>did</u> just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  <u>That's</u> the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
You walked.  What the hell are you doing here.
What are you doing here?
Exercising my visitation rights.
I don't want you here, Terry.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
-- You know his name is Frank.
In a couple of days this whole thing --
Hello, Rachel.
We've certainly missed you.
I know you haven't. Look, just go meet him as a favor to me. I talked to this guy. Hope I pronounced his name right. He sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when I told him how talented you are. He agreed to see you this Saturday. He said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. His words.
I'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. More qualified. Goddamn phony.
...Uh-huh.
...I guess I've been all wet.
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
What's involved, aside from putting up the money? What're you looking for the partner to do?
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
Right! Strictly business.
...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.
...Say, where do you get those things anyway?
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Hell, I, I'm not proud of it. But, uh, that's not the worst of it. I got a note. A blackmail note. You know, come across or everybody knows.
I guess it would be pretty awkward.
The sonofabitch. The blackmailer. It's, uh, it's no one you know. It's a businessman from Sacramento. A goddamn pansy, Ed. He tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; I heard him out and then told him to go to hell. And the very next day, the very next day, Ed, I get blackmailed for the same amount.
I'm at Nirdlinger's. Let yourself in.
...Huh?
Where you going?
...What's so damn strange about that?
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
Good! That helps. Not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. Of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. Now. Interview. I'm seeing her tomorrow. You should be there. Three o'clock. One more thing: you keep your mouth shut. I get the lay of the land, I tell *you* what to say. No talking out of school. What's out of school? Everything's out of school. I do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. Understood?
...You've gotta give me something to work with. Freddy Riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. He can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. Look. Look at what the other side is gonna run at us. They got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's Motive. They got a murder scene *you* had access to. That's Opportunity. They got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
OK, how did you know?
I don't know. I don't think so.
...I don't think so.
Taking it seriously.
Yeah.
...Ed?
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
Yeah.
...How you today, Ed?
You don't got a headache?
...Nah.
'Lo, Ed.
What'd he say? Does he understand?
There are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  Claimed they saw a monster. They're pretty determined to tell you their story.  You want to see them?
You haven't got the authority.  Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
Sweet Jesus!
My office is on the third floor! There's a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  We can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
I had no idea the Museum had a complete collection of Piranesi's Forum sketches.
To the left twice then five no... sorry... I think it's fifteen... it's been a while...
The whole system is shutting down! We have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
I told you!  They seal off all the cells.  They were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
Careful.  That mess on the ground is brains.
In this violent world, I believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
Call me Vince.
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
So the method of death is the only connection?
They heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  Nice touch.
You think what we've got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
This isn't an animal, Vince.  I've been on this case four months, remember?  I've learned a few things.
Pardon my French, but bull shit.
Dr. Green has to see you!
It's still back there!
What's that?
Dear God.  Where are we, Lieutenant?
Yes it is.  I'm tired and I'm no longer needed --
Come on, Margo.  We're on the verge of something huge.  Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  What if John was right.  I mean, what if?  And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  When it got to the museum, it hatched.
We will.
How many storage areas are there?
Something tried to get into this room!
You work here?
Way cool.  Then you know where the dinosaurs are.
She's never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  That lady said they were on the fourth floor.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
Margo, you haven't heard?
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
Eats them?
And John?
My God.  Then it was an animal.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
It's okay, I'm all right.  I remember now... It was an animal.  Something large!  I could smell it.  It was hunting me.  I saw two green eyes in the dark.
Dr. Green...
I'm so glad to see you.  What's the occasion?
When do you want to leave, remembering, of course, you do lose a day on the way there?
That's right.
I'm sure we'll get him on this next sweep.
Thank you.
We find many viewers leave him on all night for comfort.  Haven't you ever watched your child or your lover sleep?
Are we talking Emmies?
He was curious from birth - premature by two weeks, as if he couldn't wait to get started.
I've been tempted.  But I think it's important to retain objectivity.  I wouldn't want to get emotionally caught up.
Nothing was real.
What's he doing?
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
But why didn't he just follow her to Fiji?
You take Japanese.
That's right.  Lauren.
So when are you leaving?
You think so?
I've got to talk to you.
I think I'm mixed up in something.
That's the "Big Guy".  Quite a paintbrush he's got.
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Oh, God.
Maybe I feel like a teenager.
What're you doing down here?
I know.
Oh, my God!
I don't know--
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
How are you, Mother?
You look very pale, Truman.  Are you taking your vitamin D's?
Tyrone, what if I said I didn't want meatball today?
Do you live around here?
I think that about does it, Spooky.
Does what?
Special Agent Scully --
Yes.
Working with?
What is it you find incredible?
No, they don't.
You've got something to show me.
Tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
How'd you find me?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
I'm a doctor, but I think I mentioned that. OB-GYN.
They want to discredit you -- for what?
Dr. Kurtzweil, I'm not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. I don't believe in the Elders of Zion, the Knights Templar, the Bilderburg Group or in a oneworld Jew run government --
Negotiating with whom?
-- You saw this experiment?
Panic? Have you ever seen me panic, Scully?
Scully, get somebody to open this door.
Mulder? Tell me this is a joke.
Whatever you told them in there, you don't have to protect me.
You're... quitting?
No.
According to this tag.
Something I couldn't show to anyone else. Not without more information. And not without causing the kind of attention I'd just as soon avoid right now.  The virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I've never seen before. What it did to them it did extremely fast. And unlike the AIDS virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
All the equipment is brand new.
About a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
Mulder --
You can't quit, Scully.
We've got to keep moving.
We're going to the morgue.
I don't have his number.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
She's missing. We've been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
Mr. Mulder.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
Don't bring it home in this.
Is it cold in here?
You think you can do this, don't you?
Evil.
Wait...
Where the hell are we?
That went well.
Yep.  Eloped.
I told you.  You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
He's mine?
He also says that until proven differently, Julia Hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
Already there.
Delano?
Not a gift.  A highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all.  A genetic fluke.
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
Warscheinlich ist der murder.
The doctor Harry used to go to. He was passing just after it happened.
Drink?
When...what did you do?
...to steal my girl.
A moment ago you said you didn't want to see the Porter.
What's the matter?
I wish I knew.
Have you seen Calloway?
...you know.
Here, it will be cold on that train.
Nichts danke. Kein.
Right. Sit down Miss Schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Joseph Harbin...
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Must you take those?
I don't want it.
Can you tell me whose...
Been here long?
...policemen. I have to call them sheriffs.
And there was a third man there. I suppose that doesn't sound peculiar to you.
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
Miss Schmidt.
As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane.
So would I.
Bring him in.
Look...I tell you, you don't think I'm blind, do you?
Shall I go over there, sir?
The author. Thought you might be interested.
Very popular, sir.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
You told them, didn't you?
Coffee.
It's wonderful how you keep the tension.
We came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. A friend of his called to him from over there. Harry went across and from up there came the truck. It was just about here.
...you.
Vinkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Find out?
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
I was told that he did not die at once.
Help you out?
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
Nice work.
Hi.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
What do you care?
Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now.
Why no silencer?
"...<i>und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze</i>..."
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Oh, really?
Where'd you get this?
See, the Jews love to separate things: the holy from the profane, milk from meat, wool from linen, the Sabbath from the week, the Jew from the gentile.... As if one little scrap of this was going to completely contaminate that.
You're learning the Hebrew really fast.
The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?...
Okay...  Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
You can't. Do you know how many people I've brought into...the movement...?
No. What are you looking for?
I didn't notice his shoes.... Did your mother know he was there?
Who's Eichmann?
Why are you taking that?
An investment banking house.
People hate Jews. Do you agree?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out?
Leo Strauss...  I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Is it okay if I record this?
In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it?
My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally.
And? WHat did you notice?
Those aren't Jews.
What? Excuse me?...  You're kidding, right?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else?
To hear them read Torah.
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God.  You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
So are you... But they'll believe you....  Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house.  Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
How did you get the fucking number?
No!
Daniel Balint.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
What is happening?
No, I don't admit it's stupid.
This will be a different kind of device.
Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
I'm in a kind of...underground...thing.
I didn't. I told you, I can't --
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct?  But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire?
Leary?
There's some maple walnut in the freezer.
Beth Shalom? It's Reform.
Oh, fuck you...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
You're going to live here permanently?
I think, he's really nice... He's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
Where did you two meet?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
What are you doing here?
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Don't.
Enzo, wake up!
You shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
What's with the voice?
For others, yes... For you, who knows?
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
What room have you got?
It's okay.
Damn right!  That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Not at all!
... Everything.
Here...  Here...
What is it?
You don't have that one, do you?
That's good.
It's not safe, they say.  The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  Free diving is over as a sport.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
Lucky I was there to save you.
... Not at all.
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
I brought Johana to meet you.
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
It's my apartment.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
What are they for?
... And those?
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
Mayol... Jacques Mayol.
... The truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  We weren't able to save the equipment.
I guess I could be chalant about it, but then again I'm not even sure if that's a word. Listen Chief, we could stand around arguing all day, but I gotta case to crack.
From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times...
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Any sign of Santa?
So, now what?
So don't show a picture.
...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community.
Hello Mazel Tov! A boojee boojee boojee boo...
Oh. It means that Santa's gonna fuck Hanukkah's shit up.
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
No, it was the perfect level.
When you marry champagne, Clo-Clo, you can't trade it in for beer. You're stuck with it.
Maybe I should just forget all about money - - forget about mamma and the kids and the rent, huh - marry some poor dope like -- oh, like Carlos Dominguez - - and get fat and —-
Mmm———yes.
Is he in love with you?
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
They don't say it to me.
) They buried Teresa today and they were hunting the leopard again -- out in the country this time. But they didn't get him.
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed -— He'll come up with something.
Yes?
Why?
We had given up digging in a certain barrow. I went back and I tried again. I just had a hunch.
I don't know.
It was you, Galbraith!
I didn't do anything. She screamed. Something frightened her.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait ——
You can go now, Manning. There is no way we can hold you legally responsible.
Go on foot.
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
I thought -- is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight ——walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance this town will never forget!
On his back, I suppose.
You're too good to me.
Are you all right?
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
Who is he?
I can use them.
Why do you want to stay around here? It'll only make you feel badly.
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
I hated you that day —- you and your flip talk -— with that little girl lying dead.
That might depend on where you’re going.
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard. 
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
Have you got a pen?
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
I’ve had a long and unpleasant day. I’m tired and I’m angry. But mad? Not yet.  I paid Leon’s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven’t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
How... When did you...
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn’t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
Crow what?
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Where is he?
Ever seen him before?
Where are we?
How many of you scumbags are here?
No.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
You’re out of your mind. What’s the idea?
What is?
At what time will you be available?
What are you talking about?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
I’ll be alone.
Where’s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
Can I get up now?
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
I’d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
What’s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie?  Combien, Nathalie!
Bye. And thanks... Nathalie gently closes the door, eyes Lombard who shakes himself awake... rolls her eyes and surveys the room...
So why didn’t he?
I think you’d rather not know what I think.
Moreau? C’est moi. Alors...
Jeanne, stop it!
Good.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
I'll go.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
To be killed in battle?
Will you at least let me stay with you?
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
I'm staying, Jean.
Good.
No...
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
It is not for us to burn her, my lord.  That is your prerogative.
Where... where am I?
God defeated the English, not me.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
You must take the oath!  Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
When exactly?  A day, a week -- when?
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign!  In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you!  If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death!  Is that what you want??
Thanks be to God.
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
You really think she's been sent... by God?
So how would you put it?
You told us about the appearance of this... voice.  What exactly did you see?  Part of it... or all of it?
That's not a lot.
Yes... they were.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
What's going on?
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Well...?  Shall we go?
Not yet.
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
And it's not the first one!  They say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
Damn right!
Clear?
No... not like this...
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
You also cut your hair short like a man, and in the Bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  It proves your desire to deceive...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
No...!
Besides, what about these...?
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
I swear I'll never swear again in my life if you save her life!  But I'm warning you, if you let her die, then you're the biggest...
We... won?!
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace?  You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Why not?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
Yes I am.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne?  You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion.  You see?  In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Why did she have to die?
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
Wladek, please.
I'll be fine.
What?
It costs.
Of course they'll notice it. But look--  This is a good place for something.
You sell anything?
It's nothing to do with you. It's me they wanted, not you. Why do you interfere in other people's business?
Otherwise what?
Yes, so did the Germans.
You're an artist, Wladek, you keep people's spirits up. You do enough.
But I want to help, I want to.
You know what? You treat me like dirt!
Pig!
They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared.
I tried your friends. They're not at that address any more.  But.
It's a little cut, nothing.
Pack, darling, get your things, pack.
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
No, I don't think so?
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
What's happening?
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
Like it were a piano?
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Oh, yes, yes of course, a concern.
Baines is packing up?
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
You mean in signs?
Please take us to the beach where we landed.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
What's in here then, lead?
Oh no, it can't come now.
We can't leave the piano
I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano.
He's given it to us.
Do I know any gigs?
Lieutenant Snyder.  Bunco.
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
How 'bout a handkerchief?
I got twenty or so in here tonight. Take your pick.
Paltrow, Sterling, Furey, and the Big Alabama are in from New Orleans. Fiskin and the Boone Kid from Denver, and Phillips, Barnett and Limehouse Chappie from New York. Those and the guys outside should give ya 30 or so to choose from.
You think my play is bad?
You'll take a cut of what I make, won't ya?
You been making your payoffs, haven't ya?
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
I just got the count.  We'll put the take on the 4:15.
You the Duff that didn't come up with his end when Little Jeff was sent up?
I like griftin'.
Doyle, can I see you a minute?
Which one?
No, we checked his story with a tipster.  He was cleaned by two grifters on 47th.
And a packing company, a chain of Savings and Loans and half the politicians in Chicago and New York. There ain't a fix in the world gonna cool him out if he blows on ya.
He's not as tough as he'd like to think.
No signs of trouble?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Why didn't you tell me about Snyder before?
You were right, Henry.  It's not enough... But it's close.
He usually plays with a Royal or a Cadenza.  I got you one of each.  He likes to cold deck low, 8's or 9's.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
Thank you.  You don't know how much I appreciate this.
2:00 A.M.
You got a back door to this place?
You were set up, Lonnegan.  Shaw's been planning to beat your game for months.  He was just waiting for you to cheat him so he could clip ya.
That's worth fifteen grand to ya?
660 Marshall Street.  Tomorrow at 12:30, if you're interested.
Get on with it then.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
'Cause it's better to do it all at once.  We're puttin' down 400 grand next week.  At 5-1 we make 2 million. Twenty per cent of that is yours if ya stick with us.
What happened?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
I'll make parole.
I'll need a room over there that faces this way.  How much a week?
You know how they are... sex...
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I can't.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Do you think I care
Dorothy.... listen to me. I love you.  Don't you understand that? I love you.
What is it?
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
Mother!
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Yes.
Come on in.
It's been the same one for three months.
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
It's a promise?
How's your brother?
That woman!
What's he want of you?
Ask him.  I don't know.
This gun yours?
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Well, what'd you think?
When was that?
About three.
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning.  Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
Let me go!  Let me bring her back. I can't get along without her. I'll bring her right back and I'll tell you anything you want to know. Let me go!
I thought you said you weren't going there.
What bonds?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
Did you get my money?
Nothing, thank you.  Nothing.  I wanted to see you...  What's Mimi up to, Charles?
What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
How is Studsy?  I didn't know he was out of stir.
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
Only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
No.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
My soul, woman.  I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
It was his body that was buried there.
Well, don't they?
Couple of months anyway.
Yes!
Yes.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
You his wife?
Where are you going?
Turn the car around.
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you.  You don't even know if there's anything out there.  What the hell are you thinking?
What are we going to do!?
What are you doing.
He's not so--
I don't want to see people killed any more than you.  But we try to help out we die, and all we do is die.
I don't know.  There's a lot of space up here.  They could be just about--
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping.  Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
That why you tried to put a bullet in my head in the middle of the desert.
Knock it off!
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
You know what?  I think you got Schwarzkopf.  You did!  You got the General right in the ass.  Now that's good shooting.
What!?  What!?
They finally start the ground war, and where are we?  Same place we've been since we got here.  Securing freedom for the dirt.
What are you going to do with your <u>third</u>?
Steady it out!
Don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.
If you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now.  Nobody uses delayed-fuse mines anymore.
Just relax.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
This.  Whatever it is.
I don't hear any--
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
Jesus, Jaeger.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
We got to go back.  We got to go back for Wes.
No.
I never killed anybody before.  I talk a good game, but I'm not like that.
You still got a map on you?
I pick that way.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
That's if the war is even still going on. Way things were shaping up it's probably long over.
Don't go bitch on me now!  You were going to kill me.  Kill them!
Damn it.  We lost the horses.
The...the gold...
You lie in the middle of the road, look like you're hurt.  When the car stops I run over to the driver and put a gun to his head.
Epps?
I'm making you uncomfortable.  Baking away in a desert in the middle of nowhere facing three-hundred-thousand screaming Iraqis with nerve gas scud missiles, that doesn't bother you.  But me making a little noise is driving you out of your skull.
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
How do you say "Come here, baby.  I'm horny."  I can use that now.
You ever think about dying?
God!  I don't believe I'm doing this.  I don't.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
I don't know.  It would be small, easy to transport and hide.  Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
I think I'm going to throw up.  I am. I'm going to toss.
Maybe we should give him some water.
You're going to burn up in those.
Cortex bonding....possible temporary.  Before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
Drug evasion with....
What's this?  Why did you change it?
They'll come for me right away if I'm not there.  I have to go.
What's going on....what are you doing?
What?
I was lost.
We'll never make it through that mainway...I wonder what happened to SEN.  I'm crazy!  This whole thing is crazy...What am I doing?  My mind is full of so many things I can't think of anything, anymore.  Who are you?
Remember this...?
What do you want?
Officer Reilly, vice.
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
Hey, that's the guy-
What?
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
Hey, look--
The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
Yep.
You guys seem pretty tight.
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
So cut both.
Your partner?
Ex-girlfriend?
Whadaya mean?
Glass, what is it?
Relax, Pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
Alright!
You okay?
Why are we stopping here?
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
It's a bluff. The guy's full of crap.
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Device.
So what're we looking for?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
Captain...
Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
I'll do it.
What's this?
So you lost a handbag, madame?
M'sieu Laval, Madame would like to talk to Mademoiselle Gautier for a moment.
M'sieu Laval, M'sieu Filiba would like very much to see you.
Yes, M'sieu Laval?
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
And then what happened, M'sieu Filiba?
No.
Funny, the kind of men women fall for.
He's really not a bad fellow.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
No, Baron!  I beg your pardon.
No, not at all!
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
I like you, Baron.
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Beautiful. And what of it?  Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
He recognized you!
Spanish passports?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight.  Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late! 
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
Yes.
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Naturally I did.
That's too dark.
I'll be delighted.
Um-hum ...
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that! 
But attractive--
On the night table.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
<u>Adolph</u>?
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years.  I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Two lumps, madame?
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
For all the really important things--
Yes, madame?
I beg your pardon!
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
She's not on the starboard side either.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
This should be amusing.
Almost as good as you.
You know somebody?
Why have we stopped?
I'm Jack Dawson.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
May I cut in, miss?
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
You're trembling.
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I know, I know.
Will this work?
I promise.
April 14, 1912.
Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
It's been 84 years...
I don't understand you. It is a fine match with Hockley, and it will insure our survival.
Anya!
How'd you ever get away with it?
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
You'll excuse me. 
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
Nice lines--
Good-by!
You work too fast for me, young man.
I could see you were pining away--
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Are you screwy?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Say--wait a minute!
How's your mother feeling?
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Care to join us?
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
I'll go with you.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but <U>that</U> would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live <U>my</U> life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin <U>hers</U>--Do I make myself clear?
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Back is in New York.
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Is this your gun?
Are you happy?
Am I a member of this club?
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
Very good, Mary--
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
So what?
Get that out of your trunk.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
What happened to you?
That's him! That's the sucker!!
Thanks to me.
You leave the kid alone.
Just smile again and be reasonable.  I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
I mean--a lot of gentlemen would be offended if you searched them like that.
Telegrams.
What d'you think of the singer?
I saw that look on your face just now. What's between you and Wyatt?
Excuse me?
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
On three?  You call it.
I beg to differ.  We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
I'm a good woman to you, Doc. Don't I always take care of you? Nobody cares for you like me.  I'm A good woman.
Since when is faro a business?
Well yeah.  Pretty much.  I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc.  I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
He's drunk.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt.  I Literally don't care if I live or Die.  But even I can't fight human Instinct.  Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
How you feelin', Doc?
What?
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us-
Wyatt, are you crazy?
Colorado's closer
You know, we might just pull this off.
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
You're a little touchy about it.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids.  That suits Me right down to the ground.  In Fact, that's my idea of heaven.  All right, what's your idea of heaven?
No, no, get away, get away from me...
Those Cowboys're tellin' Everybody in town they're gonna Clean you out.  They're down in That lot right now behind the OK Corral.
They're just lonely is all.  Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
Really?  What about hell?  They got A sign or what?
It's that woman from the coach!
Yeah?
What's it look like?  They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Acquired?
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Maybe I jumped the gun.  Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted.  You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Here they are again.  Look at 'em.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
You'll never make that stick.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up.  Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble.  And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?'
It's too late -
I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
I'm sure they will.
Sometimes kill the crew; other times -  Torture them.
I'm sorry.
I appreciate your time -
By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea?
Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone.
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
Plastique explosive shoelaces.  Cut them to regulate the size of the blast; totally harmless until you attach the detonator hidden in the heel of your shoe.
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Wade, what the hell are you doing here?
I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course?
No.
Vodka martini, shaken not stirred.  And another for you?
I see my date is here.  And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
You have to excuse Miss Winch: She thinks she's on a 'seduce and destroy' mission through life...  ...But she won't kill us.
No. First, because I don't think it's in your nature. And second, because there's no gold down there.
And what do you call this?
Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there.
Blood or Dutch?
He was my father's best friend!
What the hell does that do?
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
If it's radio controlled, it'll break the code.
... Yes???
... And what do you call these?
I was an attorney!
You won't get away with this!
Yes -
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Obviously, the British government denies all of this -
Please sir. Please -
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
Well, you are his grandfather. He is supposed to spend some time with you. You're supposed to show him those woodsy things and this and that.
Yes.
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1/2 baths mean.
Will you still get the money from your father?
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
Like a veil has been lifted?
It was nip and tuck.
I could swear I heard my son call me.
I don't want to wear out welcome, but you can stay in someone's heart longer than you can stay in their house. Come with us, boy. We are going to have a good time.
I'm not going to let him get away with murder.
No, I'm too hot now.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
Man, act like this is your home.
Good morning.
Everything these days is made overseas.
I tried to teach him right from wrong just like I did his Junior.
How is everybody?
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
None of your business.
In the meantime Harry can slaughter us a hog.
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
I let this rabbit foot do in place of my toby that I lost years ago.
Did you have your child at home?
He's just raffish. Harry put him up to it. Before evening sun sets, I would have his belongings back on Route 55, that old fox.
What must I do?
Why not? Harry says that's the only way to do good.
He just leeches off your parents. He is a master at wearing out welcome.
Well, sure, we can leave it up.
Can I bring some toys?
Yeah?!
Here!  In the car!
What are you doing over there?
Shut up!  Just shut up, you idiot!!
Now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
You mean it has hyperdrive?
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
What happened to you?
Great!
Ha-ha!!
Did I get my package in the mail?
Oh, no!
Will you quit moving around?!
Yeah.  Like the attic.  Heh, heh...
Were you scared?  Tell me honestly.
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Last present!
Juvenile intrusion!  Repeat! Resume your positions NOW!
Not now, Mom, I'm BUSY!
W-w-w-we?
No, Slink --
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Ha, ha, oh, I love you, too.
I can't hold on much longer!
There's no mirror.
He made that. In his off hours.
Can I come into bed with you for a little while, I feel terrible.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
I hope he doesn't pick on Jonathon.
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
Sixteen. Well, nearly sixteen.
Still, this was a sensitive issue for me and I wanted to thank you personally.
One thing bothers me...  That kid they dropped off had coke and heroin in him.  Serious amounts.  He's lucky he lived.  So I gotta ask: what's your daughter on?
Why does he need money?
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered...  How am I supposed to survive?  I'm giving birth in three months.  How do I get through this?
Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying.  There's too much heat on Carl.
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
My Leica's gone.
Where are you going?
What's up?
Just watching you.
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Will we get invited to the White House?
How long's the job?
Yes.
Parents still together?
Yes, mom --
Chill out --
So does half of San Diego.
Not Tiger Woods.
Yes.
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
So go shower already.
No, this is not possible.  And I thank you for coming down here, though I suspect it's been a pointless journey.
I'm six months pregnant.  I won't do it.
It should be... It's yours.  I want our debt forgiven.  I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States.  And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Javi!  Come on.  Don't pull this you don't care bullshit.  This is incredible information.  It must be. Javi --
We agree.
What's your name?
That's your past.  I want to talk about your future.  Would you be willing to do something for me?
You watch and learn.  I earn his trust.  Then more pain.  Then I appear with kindness.  Within a week he will follow me around like a dog.
It could mean that, yes.
We kidnapped Noriega out of Panama. Is that covered in your Constitution? Because it isn't in mine.
I hope when you were on the bench, Judge Wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.
That triple the amount of stuff is going through.
I got money.
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas?
I don't know what to say.
What?  I thought Madrigal was dead. I thought it was verified.
I mean, who runs interdiction on the Mexico side?
Well, I've not brought them.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
Cool down, Franco. The guy's sorry.
Sorry.
I don't see why not.
No, not holding hands.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
Well, it isn't.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Well, you're not going to tell anyone, are you, and besides, I thought we could meet up afterwards, maybe go somewhere together.
What? Steady like?
Sixteen next month.
What was it, pneumonia or cancer?
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Indeed, yes, those halcyon days.
Thank you, Mr. Murphy. We'll let you know.
Have you got any gear on you?
Thanks, Mark.
Another dab?
Screenwriter?
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
Despite the Academy award?
God, you're sick.
Why?
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
What was your price?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
Sure, sure. I've heard it before.
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
And see when I get out of here. I've got plans. Going to get myself straightened out and head off to Thailand, where women really know how to treat a guy. See, out there you can live like a king if you've got white skin and a few crisp tenners in your pocket. No fucking problem.
Yeah.
Such as?
This starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the Barrier?
No, no, it's not possible.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
Bad news, gentlemen. Shore leave's been cancelled.
What do you know of my pain?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Very well, Mr. Scott. Carry on.
Mr. Scott, get the transporter working. If we contact a rescue ship we'll need it.  Which way to the turbo shaft?
On the contrary. Gravity is foremost on my mind. Look, I'm trying to make an ascent here. Why don't you go pester Dr McCoy for a while?
There was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. It was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of Vulcan. But he was a revolutionary.
At footspeed I estimate the journey to Paradise City at 1.2 hours.
You must allow us to act.
You ordered me to kill my brother.
How do you know?
Is what possible?
You're right. I'm a little out of practice.  Uh....that's an "s."
The emergency channel, open.
I must have your starship.
I trust your message was received?
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?

I am a Starfleet Officer.
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
You call that getting over it?
Hello, Alan.
Alan. Alan Bailey.
No, it'll run independently. It can watchdog the MCP as well.
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
where's your program? Won't it miss you?
I'm sorry -
It's my fault. I programmed you to want so much...
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
Walter, I sympathize, but I have data coming out of the Master Control Program saying there is something screwy --
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hah.
You wish. Man, I haven't had a second to think since I got down here. I mean in here. Out here. Whatever.
Then...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
I hate to disappoint you, pal, most-the time, that's how it is for Users, too.
How about you?
What's goin' on?
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
New guy...
He lies!  I was there!  I was in the nurse's office, cause I had a headache.
Yeah, right.
Fourteen, Harry.
It doesn't mean anything.  She buys antiquities for Khaled.
It's all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. You have a suite at the Marquis Hotel under Renquist.  Okay, reality check.  Go.
Hey, did that guy Harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  Cause apparently that's the only way we're going to catch the son of a bitch --
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
I still don't believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
Give me the page.
You tell on me, I tell on you.
What about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
You've reached a new low with this one.  I can't believe you're crazy enough to use the room at the Marquis.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
Any minute now.
This is Samir.  See if you can guess his specialty.
You think I care about their					* cause?  Or yours?  Not at all.					* See, America is on top now .  .				* .  but so was Rome, once.  All					* civilizations crumble.  One nation succeeding over another. What does it mean in the long run?  The only important thing is to live well.  And...  living					* well takes money.							*
Fine, honey.  Stay asleep.
You weren't attracted to him at all?
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
Let me out of her!  Right now!
Do you still love your husband?
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
God, you have great legs.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
What?
Do you still love me?
As much as you used to?
And you've got one.
So you're basically lying your ass off the whole time?  I couldn't do it.
Yeeaoowww!!
Get going! 
Okay.  It's just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  If I get a signal...  I may have to leave suddenly.
Worse than Cairo?							*
Not here.  I'll call you and we'll rendezvous again.  We have to leave separately, so we aren't seen together.  For your safety.
You'll call me then?
Do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  Your phones are almost certainly tapped.  And you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this Renquist, who may be a--
Find out who this Renquist it.
Hello, Alabama.
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
The letter I sent.
Want some Goobers?
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
What do you want to know?
Burt Reynolds.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
Is he black?
Is he nice?
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
No no no no no no no no no...
Why?
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Why Cancoon?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Nigger, get real. You touch Jayne Kennedy she'll have you ass in Wayne County so fast -
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
Grab a seat there, boy. Want some dinner? Grab yourself an egg roll. We got everything here from a diddle-eyed-Joe to a damned-if-I-know.
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
Money problems?
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
Is he big league?
Elliot Blitzer.
What's to think about?
Leave the gorillas.
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
No. Not yet.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
I'm your son.
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Nope.
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
That Vietnam movie?
We talked him into it.
Or a bit player -
Rock whores.
You OK? That stupid dumb-ass didn't break your nose, did he?
Preach on, Big D.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
You must be high. Uh-huh. No way.
I'm not gonna put that shit in my purse.
No, I ain't been there. But I heard him say. Hollywood Holiday Inn. Kinda easy to remember.
Are you Dick Ritchie?
Well?
To be determined by the proper authorities.
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
A jail?  Prison?
No, 1995 is the past.
Clues?  What kind of clues?
What's the matter with your leg?
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
First, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running.  Okay?
I think I've seen this movie before. When I was a kid.  It was on TV.
They may be looking for us, James.  Use this.  You can fix it in the Men's Room.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
"What about the germs?"  I say.  He goes, "I don't believe in germs.  Germs are just a plot they made up so they can sell you disinfectants and soap!" Now, he's crazy, right?  Hey, you believe in germs, don't you?
Of course not, I never thought you were. You want to escape, right?  That's very sane.  I can help you.  You want me to, don't you?  Get you out?
What...???
I mashed the spider, didn't I?
It's a digital reconstruction of a message, Cole, from a weak signal on our contact number.  Did you make that call?
What...virus?
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
You "develop" viruses and you're calling me insane?  Typical.  What does this virus attack?  Don't tell me, you sick fuck, it doesn't matter.  Have I ever "developed" a virus?  Do I put helpless animals in cages and measure their reactions to electrical stimuli? Do I inject radioactive substances into living creatures and examine their bowel movements?  Wow!  And I'm crazy!
No, thank you.
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Lost my eyes on Okinawa.  Lost them fighting the war.  Fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Pepsi.  Pepsi ain't nothing but flavored water.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Not this twig, friend.  I got plans.
You want to make a kiddies bet?
It's nonsense.
It will.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
How much.
You Harlin?
Harlin around?
Will he be back soon?
Yep.
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
How much time?
You got to be more careful.  I remember one time--
Don't look like nothing.
How much?
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Please, just leave the car alone.
Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, hon.  Enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
Poor thing.  Is she all right?
For the love of God would you two give it a rest?  Lord almighty.  In all my years I have never seen anything so pathetic.  How far did you think you were going to get with this?  Neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  Now use what little smarts you got.  If I was going to bust you I wouldn't have waited until after you killed Jake.
. . .at the very least.  I know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  Now, how much did you get?
That wasn't so bad.  What's thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  It didn't hurt a bit.
Jake.  I thought you would be at work, dear.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  Had them long as I can remember.
That's good.  Cools you right off.  I saw you watching me.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
No.
And I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
Have you ever been there before?
I can't.
Jake.
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
I don't know what I was thinking, but I can't do it.
I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole.  There's only one way to do that.
There has to be!
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
Let's go in the bedroom.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
You heard me.  Count it out.
He was going to take the money.
Now what?
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
What difference does it make?  You killed Jake.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
You idiot!  You'll kill us both!
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
Wait a second--
Like you don't know.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
I was hoping we could talk.
I do.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
You meant it.
Because I think you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
Thirteen-thousand dollars.  Had you done it.  Isn't that what we agreed on?
Yeah, well, me too.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
Come on, Jake--
Not from where I stand.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
That's a shame, John.  A real shame.
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
A hundred-forty-five really.
Kids.
Jesus!
Wouldn't know anything about it.
Is there a problem up the road, Sheriff?
Got any cold soda?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
I think I've heard that before.
Who's cursed?
You expect me to believe that?
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off, somebody gets hurt.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Mexico?  You going to Mexico?
I'm a solid man.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him.
Would you?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
You're talking like a madman.
You love her, but you hate her?
If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
Next time you'll do just fine.
I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful.
Cause she's dead.
How old are you?
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
You want to take a look at my car?  I think the radiator hose is--
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
Accident.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Nothing.
What the hell happened to my car?
You've been there?
Two-hundred.
Yeah, but it was shot.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car.
No! Okay! Okay!
What you want?
Eh?
I call the sheriff.
That's right on my way.
I like that about me, beautiful.
I got it.
Accident.
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
You're welcome, Grace.
Drove into Superior?  What for?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  What is it you want?
You never did answer my question.
Still playing?
Are there snakes out here?
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I don't know how.
It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
What's the matter?...Grace?
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
I'm sorry...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell.
I can't see it.
I'm not sailing his boat.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
There was a young fellow over at Jamilla's today when it got hit.  Way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
I need a ticket.
Out of here.
Genuine Draft?
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's <u>you</u>. You <u>Grace</u> or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife.... What do you way Grace?
They look nice.
No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
Yes. Is this David?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
Skeptical about what?
In college. A car accident.
What do you want?
Just give me a minute.
I got you a seat in the seven hundred level.  It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on.
I thought he was carrying something.
I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color.
I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that.
I'm very proud of him.  He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.  They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
Send him packing. I'm not walking all the way over there.
When?
I want to sleep here tonight.
Jeremy.  I'm going in. I have to do some things.
What do you do if something happens?
I'll just shoot him once.
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
...I got a present for you.
We was... lyin'.
Where's Little Bill for Christ sake?
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Mmmm pistols.
He admit it?
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Hit your finger, huh?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
What's your name?
Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
Is... is it... loaded?
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
What'd Ned say?
You're Pete Sothow's nephew, huh? Hell, I thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' I done in the old days.
Been gone near three years now.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
If he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
It's gonna get riper yet.
Did... you... get... him?
I can't see 'em.
That was... the first one.
This here money, take my share an' Ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. Tell 'em half goes to Sally Two Trees if I ain't back in a week. The rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
You sure you ain't armed?
Huh?
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Yup. You still got the Spencer rifle?
I ain't blamin' her, Ned, I ain't holdin' it against her.  She knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch I was... an' she won't allow how I've changed. She just don't know how I ain't like that no more.
You ain't like that no more.
Kid? The Kid's shootin at us?
No.
You... you remember Eagle Hendershot?
He's dead, Bill.
Worms was comin' out.
Claudia... ain't here, Bill.
HOW MANY LEFT GODDAMIT?
He say anythin'... The Kid... ?
I guess you didn't kill nobody then.
You was right to change your mind, Kid.
I don't like the question.
Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
Three days? We could kill 'em tomorrow.
We done that stuff.
Maybe.
We'll bury him.
I'm having a stroke.
They'll never stop.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
Get out.
They're pretty pissed off. They'll do anything. Now I got a way to do it without killing anyone: but like I said, they won't let me in without you.
What-are they speaking?
What about Redfoot?
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
Verbal, you know we're trying to help you.
You trying to get a rise out of me, Agent Kujan?
I don't know about that.
So why play into his hands? We can protect you.
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Then why didn't you help him?
He was a stool pigeon for the Justice Department. He swore out a statement to Federal Marshals that he had seen and could positively identify one Keyser Soze and had intimate knowledge of his business, including, but not exclusive to, drug trafficking and murder.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
Why did he want you to live? A one-time dirty cop without a loyalty in the world finds it in his heart to save a worthless rat-cripple? No, sir. Why'
Keaton was Keyser Soze
You're not safe on your own.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
I'11 take my chances then. I'11 feel safer without a job if a man like Mr. Kint is behind bars.
Weapons. Misdemeanor one.
I'm fine.
Nothing.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
Gruber...
...I was one of a group of...
Well, many reasons, actually...
Tell me one?
That's right.
...to get her heartbeat back...?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Neurology?
Do you know Dr. Robert Towler...?
Meth...Methodology and Technique...
I am seventy-four years old.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
I . . ..
... we told them we didn't want it to come out this way.
I am seventy-four years old.
I...in that small context I would have...I would have to say 'no.'
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
The Doctors were not negligent.
...apartment.   No, no. Please.  You don't know who we're dealing with, I, please believe me, they...
'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.'  General textbook on the subject.  Is  that correct?
...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anaesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.'  Is that what happened to Deborah  Ann Kaye?  She aspirated into her mask?
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
) I'm sorry ...?
I do.  Who is it?  The Doctors. What do you owe them?
Then why don't you testify?
Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
That's it...?    Come on, guys...life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.    Frank:  I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand...and that's a lot of money...and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
That happens.
Mr. Galvin's...
I'm calling from Professional Nurse Quarterly...
This is Mr. Wallace in Subscriptions?
I changed my life today.  What did you do?
The TV didn't work.
I'm a lawyer.
Oh, actually it was.  Then why'd you call it off?
Is this a bad time.
Do you want me to go...?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed.  It's all right. I'll stay here with you.  It's all right.  Come on...
Well, then what are you doing here?
You told me so.  Maybe you'd get some sympathy.  You came to the wrong place.
Thank you.
You need my help...?  You need a goddamn keeper...are you telling me that you turned down two-hundred- ten grand?    Huh...?  Are you nuts?  Eh?  Are you nuts. What are you going to do, bring her back to life?
Mick.  Mick.  Mick...
Yeah?  And what are you going to do tonight?
What happened, Joey...?
I'm ... Mrs. Doneghy?  I'm Frank Galvin ... why didn't you go in?
These are your initials, 'K.C.'?
And did you write the numeral `one' down on the record, standing for one hour?
I did.
Dr. Towler...
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
Yes, that's correct.
But those notations stop...  ...four-and-one-half minutes after Deborah Ann Kaye's...
Four-and-one-half minutes after her heart stopped.    And they resume seven minutes...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Yes.
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
No.
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
How can I see her, to know her?
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
And when she goes to those places...
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Who you are --
But you haven't lived here long.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I want to know who you are.
Why?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Can I see you tomorrow?
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
But I like that one, Scottie.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Judy --
Where shall we go for dinner?
How does it work?
Where are you going?
But why? Why here?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
You can't. You're afraid!
Scottie, please...!
Yes!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
I don't know... Switzerland?
Wandering about.
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
What?
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
Long ago...
Why did you jump?
Take me away from here?
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
No... we're together...
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Yes, that's it. Sweet name, isn't it?  Foreign. But sweet.
What's tomorrow?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
Aren't you ever going to get married?
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight. 
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
It was hers. It was built for her. Many years ago.
She died.
By her own hand.  There are many such stories.
She's fucking hot!
I don't know why the floor was wet!
And you're a little fucking reject.
Four hours and fifteen minutes. I can make Vegas in 3 and change.
Wait!
I'm calling the ambulance.
Call the police. Okay, that's one option.
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
You don't just casually walk out of a Vegas Casino with a dead woman.
Her blood is all over the bathroom. I'd say that's a bit of a DNA problem.
No we're not. The bodies are all mixed up. We can't do this to them.
I'm talking about DNA samples, fiber optics, search parties, they got infrared scanners, FBI scientists. They figure this shit out. They always figure it out.
They won't figure it out.
Are you solid with that?
If anything ever happens to me...
Either side you idiot. I'm calling 911.
No way.
I want you to hear me out.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Well, oh...
Where is she?
Who?
He's right.
He just had two.
Oh for Christsake Boyd. Somebody must know she's here.
Shut up Boyd.
He is not cracking up.
What?
What you just said. Say it again.
Jesus Boyd you're going to O.D. him.
What are you going to do?
Hear what?
Isn't it a little late?
I'm serious.
And what happens when you can't?
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
You want some breakfast meat. Micheal. Is that what you want?
Easy Micheal.
We're goosed.
All right then. It's refreshing to see two young people not afraid of real commitment. Will you have friends or family saying words - singing or anything?
Are we supposed to?
You forgot the tent?
You can't play around with these tent people.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
I wouldn't know.
It's a bachelor party. You sort of have to do it before the wedding.
I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
How much?
We're supposed to have gold-trimmed padded seats, now they're telling me that there was a mistake and we can't have padded.
So what do we do?
I need your help.
Do you love me?
That's sweet.
Well I do.
What are you doing?
Well, can you come back inside?
Nobody's saying cancel. I'm talking about modifying.
Lois is a mess and Micheal's really upset. Everyone's upset.
I need you to pick up the cake tomorrow.
No.
Who's dead?
Like if something happened to him, he could still get us.
I...Liz...all I ever wanted, was for you to be happy. I just wanted to give you the wedding, the life you always dreamed of...  ...I just love you so much...So much...
What?
I don't know. She's really been stressing out.
I just want her to be happy.
The wahoo moment?
That ought to be about the end of that.
You can tell when people believe you. It's obvious.
I think there's a lot of truth in that. I'm gonna pursue some options. I want to join that Big Brother thing.
...embarrassing, shameful...
The stone age.
The post-Vegas Man.
Good times.
No, I don't want to because they yell. And I've got news for you too.
Two.
What's that?
Which couch?
Take me there.
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Come down here, you scamp.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
Never.
Unfortunately ...
You must listen to me before you go.
She won't even know.
Have you thought of what you want planted yet?
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
And in the vegetable plot?
Hold on, Ramon! Is there time to make another trip?
Me?
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Thank you; but it's missing something.
Where's the dough?
I don't know -- they've always been there.
But you have a right to let us know what you think.
And remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
Things seem to be getting better.
Where?
In you go! Moncho, lead the way!  You stay here.
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
I had so many things to think about!
I've had a gutful of this.
Hello.
Today, a good girl.
What?
It's not your fault. We appreciate you trying.
We don't know how, but Sid 6.7 made himself into an android.
Barnes wouldn't kill two innocent guards.
Do I need to remind you what happened to his wife? To his daughter?  I will stake my reputation that Barnes didn't kill those guards.
But with the six months off I get for being your guinea pig, I've only got to survive another 17 years, 5 months, and 23 days.
Their weapons missing?
None. He could be hiding, he could be helping Sid, or could be in little pieces on Santa Monica beach.  Any idea what Sid's going to do next?
Why didn't anybody tell me?!
What did you find out?
You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
Do I get to see it or not?
Get that fucking thing away from me!
It feels so.. .real.
This is supposed to be years away.
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
Not much. He was just a computer program. Nothing more.
I don't need a baby—sitter.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
Now that he's in the real world, there are no longer limitations on his behavior like there were in virtual reality. Sid is going to evolve.
Don't worry about it, all right?
Relax. I know what you meant.
You could have just flashed him your badge, you know?
Lindenmeyer?
They got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... Let'em leave us alone.
A new <u>take</u> on the...  Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...

Thank you, Janet...thank you, Mr. Lynch.
Yeah, but he didn't see me.
...gotta read my reports.
Hey the door was open.
Don't start, alright.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Whatever night you like.
Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment.
...Yeah, and we're working on some other interesting stuff.
Chart break-out on this one here...uh Whitewood-Young Industries...low P.E. Explosive earnings. 30% discount from book. Great cash flow. Coupla 5% holders. Strong management.
Nice club, Mr. Gekko...
I don't understand.
I got all I could get which was 750,000 shares plus 5000 March 50 calls. Average price of $47 a share And $4 per contract for the call. I just wish I could've got more.
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line.  Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment.  ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on.
And I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Gekko, and his lawyer, Mr. Salt.
I didn't know we had a meeting schedule for this morning.
Tell me, Gordon--when does it all end? How many yachts can you waterski behind? How much is enough?
...I can't make it tonight.
Gordon, it's two minutes to close. What do you want to do?! Decide.
What if I have a previous engagement?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
And what do you want?
You know, the elevator man couldn't believe I paid $300,000 to have my walls looking like this, he's got them for free in Brooklyn.
Sure, why not, money's the sex of the 80's. I never had it like you when I was growing up, baby, it wasn't the upper east side.
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
You were never that innocent sugarpie.
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Now that's a crap company, sure you'll make money on the takeover rumor, but what's being created. Nothing. No substance behind it.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline...
Businessman!
Anybody want another drink?
Hmm.
And uh, your nicotine sir
Jenkins.  Can I get you some help?
Like her?  I don't know if I ever liked her.  It's just you want what you can't get.
No Mark. MARK Why not?
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Sarah listen to me.
Sir Wilfred, this is Sarah Brighton.  This is Sir Wilfred.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Oh really?  We're they `us'es' or `them's'?
When - you're a big boy.  I mean you know it's bad for you
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
Are you mad at me?
I miss you.
Who's idea was it?
Because he was worried about me.
Your husband?
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Fine.
What's happening to me?
Uh-huh.  What can be?
Well, I'm glad.  Pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
She isn't here.
You're the flower lady.
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe?  That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
Mrs. Frank?
She never mentioned her father.
I don't know.
Wow.
He was so pissed.
We both auditioned for the Philharmonic. One cello position open.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Absolutely.
What?
Wow.  I'm losing it.
Something was there.  You saw it.
Oh God...you knew.
You don't know that.  If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out.  Somehow you have to break the connection.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I have an idea.  But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
I guess not.
I don't know...
I think three...
What's their name?
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
Tomorrow.
After that.
I'm telling you.  There was something in her voice...
"...of Perpetual Distances."  Everybody's checking their shoelaces. Pins drop.  "I'm afraid you've mistaken me,"  I say...
She could be out.  She could be sick in bed for all we know.
Maybe.  Point is...not me.
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
...Don't get all...
There we go.
Harvey says he's amazing.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Sweetheart--
You were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
The...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
Your wife...
Claire--
You should have tried harder.
Look for antiques...
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Little village down seven.  Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
I'm cooking you dinner.
What?
There are two.
With her family.  Rowan's mother died yesterday.
Nothing was ever more false.
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
He's shown himself to you... on the deck.  In the storm.
Lasher - bring us through!
If I could feel like you feel...but I have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  Things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
But I could understand. I want to understand!
Do not tell me that!
There was no thought.  There was no act.    That is not what I am.
Yessss...
What else did you see- Michael...?
Really...?  Your family there...?
Far from it, Michael... Don't put me up there.
Michael!  Jesus  I've been trying -
Rowan...   Think of what's in that book.  Think of last night!
You sure...?
I'm wondering why the hell he hasn't shown up.
Aren't we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
Wanna snack...?
Is he - is he gonna die...?
Michael - why would he want to hurt Stu...?
A bit much.    Lucas.
You've gone away from me, Ro...  Someplace I don't know how to get to.
I can't.
sooner Or later you're gonna run out of things to change.  You always do.
On which planet...?
Hey - I love gloves-  I look really great in gloves.
Mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  I mean - hell, they're all crazy anyway - right...?
No tax shelters.  No funding.  I want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  The Diedre Mayfair Research Clinic.  I'd like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
Which do you think is her best shot...
I thought you were someone else
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Hello MRS STECKLER - we haven't seen you for a long time
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Do you take sugar?
What are you doing?
If you want any - there's some left in the kitchen
Where do you kill them...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
My mother...?  I never knew my real MOTHER - I was adopted
What's wrong?
Leave!? Who the hell do you think you are?
Is LESLIE here?
It's been what, three years?
What's this all about?
Don't get me wrong. We can salivate over all the Christy Malones of our lives. Wishing we could devour them like melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. But we're strictly hamburger guys. Ground chuck, sixty eight percent lean, is about the best we can hope for.
The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April.  "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube.  Don't knock it till you tried it.
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight?
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
Wait a second, I thought we were hamburger guys.
This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro.
I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight?
Dead?
Let me get this straight...
We can't accept it.  It's much too expensive. Right, dear?
They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby.
Yeah.
Dad, let's just say I can buy anything I want in the whole bookstore. Including the bookstore.
THAT is your dream, not mine. My dream is so far beyond anything YOU PEOPLE could even imagine.
I-I don't have the keys.
You do know how to drive?
The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again.
Some of them have to be automatics.
Teddy? I was thinking.
James, what are you doing here?
Are they okay?
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
I didn't forget.
A few billion bucks and suddenly he's Cro-Magnon Man of the Year.
Ah ha! It was so well hidden, you didn't even know it was there.
Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl.
At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue.
I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy.
You're quick. I like that.
What about Charlie?  You boys could make it a little adventure.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
Like what?
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson.
What law, Merk? Having fun? Letting down our hair on prom night?
Me? The King of Coitus?
No one will be laughing at you now, Ted. You can take that to the bank.
You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print.
That's right. And guess who's the new King of the Unemployment Line.
I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling?
Not that I'm going to be much good after last night...
I love Antigua.  Maybe I'll come visit you.
No.  Not after that night.  I don't know what happened.  Maybe he caught her with some john... All I know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... Indian kid named Davy.  Used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. Him and Suzie were at the Glades that night.  It was right after that, Ray got Suzie busted and sent her away.  That's what there is to say about Ray Duquette.
The next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  His fingers... his fingers...
He said something like, "Do you want it dirty7" or something.  I tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
I... he had my wrists pinned behind me. I remember my hands were cold.'
If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I'll see you get a proper tour.
No.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
The skinny brunette.
You saw the news today?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Unless what?
You could say that.
We all have...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
So you were alone.
Not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  That's bullshit.
We've got three.  Guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
Yeah... okay... he did
You are.
Kelly.  What is it?
No you don't.
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
No!  Christ.  Listen, Kelly, I'm counting on you.  You calm her down. I mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
Hello?
Good thinking.
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
I don't mean who you're thinking.  I have other friends...
Get away from me.
Are you mad at me?
Sandy... What's up?
No.
Wait a minute.  Now I know where I've heard of you.  You're the gadget guy.
That should put us ahead of the criminals.
All right.  How about this?  We put a watch on this Pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
Garrison...?  Then the President was right.  Except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard Rebels trying to make the South rise again.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
"Spontaneous."  I like that.  Most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
Can you fill me in here?
It's better than nothing.
Willard...
It's not a guy...
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Really?
Just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
This is Colonel Richards.
Very good, sir!  I think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
Still alive.  Hmm.  I suppose that doesn't bode well for poor Bruno.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
Are you all right?
Hey...!
You're not going to use it, are you?
You left me to die, friend.
No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
I can't.
Why not?
I do what I'm told.
Say what?
He's no magician.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
You a woodcutter?
Farmer.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
Madmartigan, I need your help.
You?
Did she ask about me?
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
I'm all finished.  Now what?
What's the magician's weapon?
I just wanted to test it first.
I know she's hungry.  I tried to feed her but she wouldn't eat a thing.  I'm not a wet nurse.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Good morning. Book, is it? You are the Yankee they talk about?
I thought I was the English.
What have you got?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
Now what's the problem?
Whacking?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.  Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything.  And they can get away with it because they're cops.
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
I know what he said.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
We had some lemonade and he left.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
I was being foolish?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
I'm coming.
Better you should get off my front porch before I get my mace!
John said you're Amish.
Yes.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
God, Fred...
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I have committed no sin.
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
I will be the judge of that.
Tight. But I'm working on him.
No, you listen. Get out!
He'll live.
My son is out there!
Just listen to what Miss Gulch did to Toto! She --
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Auntie Em, really -- you know what Miss Gulch said she was gonna do to Toto?  She said she was gonna --
Poor little orphan, and her Miss Gulch troubles. Gosh all hemlock - you know, she ought to have somebody to play with.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
From now on you'll be history
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
Toto's my dog.
I thought you said she was dead.
How did you guess?
Yes --
Yes...That's Aunt Em.
Oh, dear -- That was wonderful!  You know -- we were just wondering why you couldn't come to Emerald City with us to ask the Wizard of Oz for a heart.
And bears!
Lions and tigers and bears!
...has been simply unbearable.
But why?  Why?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Did they hurtcha?
I have so got brains.
Ohhhh --
Oh, no -- I just keep picking it up and putting it back in again.
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
Um-hmm.
But maybe you'd better not.  I've got a witch mad at me, and you might get into trouble.
The other side....
It does help.  Dorothy, you're waking up!
Dear, whatever shall we do?
Oh --
Yes, you.
No?  Now, wait a minute.
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh -- now look at him!  This is terrible!
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
Oh, did - did you see that?
Oh --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
Uh - now, please don't be angry with me. I'll - I'll do anything you say, only... only if you don't shout at me. It makes me nervous!
What about the heart that you promised Tin Man --?
As for you, my galvanized friend, you want a heart! You don't know how lucky you are not to have one. Hearts will never be practical until they can be made unbreakable. I could have been a world figure, a power among men, a - a successful wizard, had I not been obstructed by a heart.
This is a highly irregular procedure! This is absolutely unprecedented!
Yes. Viktor Davidov, Miss...?
What happened to Len Tashka?
He is an impostor.  There’s no Davidov at Miratom.
Elektra King?  Are you insane?  This is her pipeline.
Is there another way?
Perhaps after this ... test?
I’ve scheduled a medical for you.
Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra’s ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
The bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. He feels no pain. He can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
Your last chance. Take the money.
You will never touch her. You will never get near her.
She’ll get over it.
Is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
You don’t take no for an answer, do you?
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid.  She was paying you off.  What for?
The Maiden’s Tower.
Perhaps this isn’t the time...
He was a...good lover?
This is the end.
What?!
What about our end?
What about the aftermath?  This so-called . . . "nuclear winter" theory?
No idea who's behind this?
Walter -- you're just telling me what you think I want to hear.
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
Rorschach's on the case.  He's got Dreiberg in a lather.  He seems to think that someone is "stalking" the Watchmen.
I guess you'll be dismantling Russian tanks soon.
Would you like me to stay?
I'm not here.  I'm still on Mars.  I've come to collect you.
Jon, no -- I can't --
I didn't give you cancer, Laurie.  Not you, not the others.  I don't know what did.
Then why don't you . . . do something about it!
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
You did the right thing, Daniel.  Let's stay in touch, okay?  Good night.
She's with me.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Yeah.  See, I've been working on a little project.  Top secret, of course . . .
And what if you¹re wrong?
Now wait.  We all had the same option as Blake.  It was work for the government or do time.
I told you I was a little bit out of step.  A lot of the old stuff I listen to -- it never came out on crystal.
Antarctica??
What?
No way.  I'm not that much of a pervert.
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
You're full of yourself.  What are you doing?
Maybe.  Or maybe somebody's finally caught up with us.  Somebody with a grudge.  Thought you might want to spread the word.
CTU.  Could be behind Dr. Manhattan frame-up.
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
Jon Osterman, you don't act like a Princeton boy.  What's a big lug like you doing in a place like this?
I don't know their real names!
I'm terribly sorry.
Jon??  You mean he's --
Adrian!  Don't leave so soon.  I --
He's a little farther gone every time.
Nasty cough.  -- Try one of mine.  Darling, you need to get out of the house.  Why don't you give Daniel a call?  I'm sure he'd be glad to hear from you.
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
Veidt.  You're the one who started World War III.
Oh I don't know, I think the tests work pretty well. Sometimes they give me answers you wouldn't admit to in a million years.
Is that a fact?
You've really got me confused, Cage. On the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. Help me out here. I'm not following your evolution.
Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear?
This is good work, X, damn fine work. You need to press on at all costs, find out what they have planned with this "Ahab".
You're a grungy little phoenix, you know that? Keep up the good work.
Yeah, that's right. So now that you know, you understand why it's important that we get it back.
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own.
Whatchu doing here?
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
You do everything Yorgi says?
Where are you going?
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
They tell me you're an American agent.
I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse.
I heard you talking. I could tell where you were in the room.
You okay?
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
He's shut out the communication circuit!
Nothing. He had two days.
Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline.
I stole your beat, huh? Guess you forgot to brown-nose the right people.
From the Beastie Boys collection?
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there?
This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind?
Sit down.
Why you dogging me up?
Thanks, but I'm here on business. I heard you're the G around here. I'm looking for some cars, expensive ones. A lot of them.
You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what?
Total chaos, man! Welcome to Anarchy 99!
You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live.
Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere.
I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
Yes -- Only there's a problem.  The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature.  It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to.  The Senator's body is literally burning itself out.  Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
You saw what happened tonight.  You think Magneto won't come after him again.  You think he won't come here if necessary.  This is a school, for God's sake.
What's wrong with him?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
What do you say?
He's uptight.
He takes his work seriously.
Logan, do you see this ring?
Math.  History.  Science.  English. Athletics --
I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey.  I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
The mutant gene tells the body when it needs to change.
Mr. Guyrich has been dead for some time Senator.
Who?
You designed this yourself?
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
Is it enough?
Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting.  But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
Oh, shit.
And your passport?
Whatever makes you happy.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
Surprised!
What a strange fellow.
Are you suggesting I call him master???
No, of course not.  I just meant...
But you can't do that at night. And even if you could -- it would cost a fortune.  Come to bed, darling.
That's a tough choice.
You mean... the laboratory??
Yes, this was Victor's... the Baron's medical library.
I didn't do that.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
But aren't you the least bit curious about it, Doctor?  Doesn't the secret of life hold any intrigue for you?
No, Fred ereck.
I see.
Incidentally -- I don't mean to embarrass you in any way, but I'm a rather brilliant surgeon.  Perhaps I can help you with that hump.
What?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
Could be worse!
Do you have the name I wrote down?
Was he any good?
He only died two weeks ago -- I'm sure they'll still have him. Hurry now.  I'll prepare the body.
You'd better hurry -- I think it's going to rain.
Tonight?
What?
You'll be getting me sad next.
I didn't make a 'yummy' sound -- I just asked what it was.
How's it going?
Is everything ready?
MMMMMmmmmmmm.
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
No, thanks!  I want to get right to sleep.
Yes!
I thought it was wonderful.
I know, but I mean -- not fooling around physically?... Or not fooling around intellectually?
Nor to Elizabeth.
You've got to help me to remain faithful.
Do you have a reservation?
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
Oh... indeed. Crealock, we should see that Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern from the Twenty Fourth.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
