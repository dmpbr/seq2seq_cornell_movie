Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
I believe we share an art instructor
What crap?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Who?
Queen Harry?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
What's normal?
You're welcome.
What?
Why?
But you hate Joey
Exactly my point
Otherwise known as an orgy?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Daddy, no!
Just for a minute
The prom?  Kat has a date?
Just sent 'em through.
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
Are you kidding?  He'll piss himself with joy.  He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's a lung cancer issue
Buttholus extremus.  But hey, you're making progress.
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
Don't make me do it, man
And why would I do that?
Nope - just came by to chat
What?  We took bathes together when we were kids.
He always look so
William didn't even go to high school
No fear.
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
My mission in life.
You -- covered in my vomit.
Seven-thirty?
Hi
Sure, I do
I know.  It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
What?
Busy
What?
No what?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Kat a fan, too?
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
Good enough.
Yeah.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Man -- don't say shit like that to  me. People can hear you.
Touch of the flu.
Pirate -- no question.
The water's going putrid in the barrels.
With a face like that?  I don't want you looking at me.  You hear?
I haven't given you much of a life.
Thank God...
I can't keep my eyes off you.  I would like to catch up with all the moments I didn't spend with you.
May I ask by whom?
This time with me!
NO...!  I have waited too long, fought too hard.  Now you expect me to take all the risks while you take the profit!  No... I will not be your servant!
Island.  Far.
Thousands.
Chief says -- he has a God.
With some difficulty.  I had to promise them you were not a total fool.
Colon!  Don't!
How long?
Oh?  So you are a new man?
Your Majesty -- some men are content to read about things.  I must see them with my own eyes.  I cannot be other than I am.
If you want to keep your head on your shoulders, you'll do as I say.
God be with us admiral.
We're on the verge of a mutiny, Colon!
You never did.  You did all the talking for both of us, remember?
Pinzon, Pinzon... All we can do now is go forward!  Think about that!
Here.  I have your money.
Where are we going?
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Disappeared.  They're looking everywhere.  Maybe he went back to Czechoslovakia.
They won't until this is over.
You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I'm glad I met you.
In the kitchen.
It was my decision, not his.
I'm ready to be briefed.  Excuse us.
I came to see how the investigation was going.  I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?!
But Chief?  Over this??
What was that, Korfin?
You do that, wiseguy.  Now let's solve this thing before Eddie Flemming does.
Yeah.
Tomorrow.  At lunch.
C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful.
I know.  Relax.  Take it easy.  Don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
I have nothin' to say.  If you wanna contact my attorney...
Oh my G-d.  Honey!  Honey's dead?
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Who says she's a suspect?
There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do.
My folks are.
Of course.
Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first.
So am I.
I took her there for a shower and that's it.
But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her.
What's your accomplishment.
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Alright?
Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
I'm not.
That was good.  You were holding the evidence.
Answer it.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
That's confidential.  Could you put the money on the dresser?
I'd like to speak for himself, okay?
Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out!
We have no money.  Come on.
Don't want to film this?
This way.  Hold it this way.  Good.
Cut!
Credit?
A job?
As a plumber?!
Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
That's what it looks like to me.
And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them.
We're takin' him.  Don't argue!
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now!
Don't blow your nose!
Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication.
That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted.
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
It's about my salary cheques.
Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they'd received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and apparently not yours either.
I don't think we should make any fuss about it yet. I'm sure they'll straighten it out.
But not completely inconceivable?
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
I guess not.
He's got a point.
Sure, Dave, what's up?
You know that we checked the two AO-units that you reported in imminent failure condition?
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
I suppose you're pretty broken up about it?
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
No, I'm sorry, darling, I told you I won't be home for a few days.
She's in the bathroom.
He's fine. But I'm afraid we don't get a chance to see each other very much these days.
Well, I hope that you and your wife can come to the I.A.C. conference in June.
Fine.
Yes, really, thank you very much.
Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.
I see.
Quite frankly, we have had some very reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in fact, what has happened?
Not really. It's completely inert. No sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of something incredibly hard and we've been barely able to scratch it. A laser drill
We're scheduled to dock in about seven hours. Is there anything we can do for you?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
Well, thank you very much, and please let us know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more comfortable.
Hal, I'm going out now to replace the A.O. unit.
Yeah, I've been busy.
How about chargin' the battery?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
Goodbye.
You just quit bein' a priest or somethin'?
What's the matter with my place?
Yeah.  Sure, i'm crazy in love with him, who wouldn't be...
You're gonna help us take him.
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
Don't worry, I got a move for ya. An awesome move. A guy named Luther. Ganz'll be paying him a visit.  We go to him right away.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
Your pal nuts enough to take a shot at me?
Bullshit.  Attitude and experience get you through...
Why?  Anybody that talks about women as much as you do probably can't get it up anyway.
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
You?  Don't make me laugh.  You can't take care of shit.  You've been dicking me around since we started on this turd-hunt.  All you're good for is games... So far, what I got outta you is nothin'...
One thing's for sure, Jack. That's how you'll tell the story.
Half a million.
Shit.
Jesus Christ.  That's a disgrace The guy pulls a gun on a cop and he's out in 24 hours.  I tell you some of the courts these days are just a fucking revolving door.
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
Yeah, most cops are pretty dumb... But since you're the one that landed in jail what's that make you?
You stay with me...
Be polite. Say hello.  This is Candy.
Bein' good at your job don't explain everything, Jack ...
Luther's on the move...
Yeah. It missed the last four stops.
There's nothin' to talk about.
Jack, come on, there is an official department policy about cop killings. Cop killers represent a special priority because any man crazy enough to kill a cop is a greater threat to an unarmed civilian... In other words, we can't seen like we're in the revenge business... I know, we all know the truth's a little different.
You might be more of a team player and a little less of a hot dog on this one, Jack.
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
Jack?
How did they get away?
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
But that's what you say about all of us all the tine ... we're always the ones fucking up when you tell it...
I guess when two cops die on account of your fuck up you want to keep it as quiet as possible...
Shit.
Hey ... Dick Tracy.
You just took a shot at me, asshole. I think you do know where he is.
Who gives a fuck what you think?
I think you're ashamed to tend bar which is sad because you look great in that outfit they make you wear... You pull down four bills a week which is damn good, and you mix the best Pina Coladas I've ever had... I think that if you need bigger and better things ... then go for em.
What makes you think I have any clean shirts at my place?
Maybe I got a fairly crummy day ahead.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Sure, okay, fine, no problem... See, there's this kid in jail ... First thing I got to do is go up and see what he knows ...
Hi, it's me...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type.  But this Indian...
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
So what?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
What do I know?  I'm just a bartender.
How would you know?
You chickenshit punk...
Honest. The place we stashed it opens Monday morning. I can't get it till then. Monday morning, that's when it opens. After that, I'll get the money to you right away...
Give it back.
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
Who?
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
You still pining for that two timing bitch. Forget her. There are a million women out there.
I've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years I've been eating those shitty croquettes.
Have you pulled yourself together?
Thanks for reminding me..
Not without Leeloo.
To save the world.
Three reasons... One: As part of The Elite Special Forces Unit of the Federated Army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
You're the only one left alive...
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished.  She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
Learning language.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
I told you not to read all that crap!
Why?... Why would you need me?
You're welcome..
Talk English Doc.
Perfect, Mr. President.
Recommendations.
Gentlemen?
"..in which all the history of the Universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..Protect us from Evil.."
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
No... not at all.  Where are you?
Really? Maybe I can get you on my screen and see you at last!
I understand.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.  It's better that way.
I know.
Why the gun?
I'm not gonna need it.  I won't even wear it.  It's a precaution.  Don't worry about me.
... What's going on?
I don't know what to say
Don't...
I just talked to her.
There ain't no such thing as snuff. Why don't you fuck off?
I'm telling you...
I promised him to Machine.
Machine.
I'd rather you didn't.
Where are the women?
I remember him.
Bring the film, or we kill him.
Put the gun down, take the handcuffs.  Handcuff yourself to the bed.
Leave him alone.
Fuck off.
They're putting themselves in place of this kid's parents and thinking they'd want to hear their girl's okay, even if that's all they hear.
Yeah, who's this?
Who is this.
I will never get tired of hurting you, Eddie, so you might want to change your attitude.
Yeah, the fucking lawyer.
I don't know...  ... out there somewhere.
Don't think I won't.
Wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.
That's trust.  Mr. Christian trusted me implicitly.
They're no friends of mine.
Shut your mouth and drive!
There's not much illegal.
I'm not a cop.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Well, there's the thing; you're not gonna know anything about what I'm doing, but you can make some money.
Four hundred a week, off the books.
What you saw tonight, we're not talking about a video some dentist takes home over the weekend.  We're talking about stuff where people get hurt.  Specialty product.
Snuff films.
You want me to come out there and play private eye?
Great.
No.
I'm telling you it's not that.
You've found missing persons before.
Nothing remotely like this.
I don't know if luck's the word. Are you feeling alright?
No.
She didn't seem herself.  For months there never was any way to get her to talk about it.  One night we went to bed... the next morning she was gone.  She took some clothes.
Why do you think he did it?
We're all like that.
I don't know.  I think so.
My husband never laid a hand on her. She would have told me... she would have told me...
It's been six years.
Why... why are you doing this to me... ?
Those are her belongings.
But she wouldn't let Dad treat me like that.
When I used to have nightmares.  I brought my friends in to help me.  Until they all started dying.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
What?
Is there something we can do?
I saw it. It was my dream.  I brought Sheila in...
Now it gets weird.  She says he comes back in dreams.  If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
Honey, we went over this in therapy.
What?
Don't worry, honey
It's where he hides out.  Inside.  That's how he found me.
Sorry, babe.
That's in the past.  Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
Alice...
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Had kind of a long night.
Mark...
Yes?
But if they <u>do</u>?
A lot of people think like that.
'His' side?  I've seen it, all right. A nice, bright yellow!
What's more important - there's our problem.  The bow ram - the sawteeth are holding the Shark in the break. If we can cut the ram, the Shark can pull herself loose!
I think you're right.
Go back and tell Dr. Neilsen. Have him report to the Skipper.
We'll have to look for them later.
What's goin' on in here, Lad? What - ?
Right, Skipper.
Speed...about twenty-two knots. Course...due north!
With their underwater experience, they'll be invaluable.  Take sidearms, and flare pistols --
Why do you say that?
What????
I think I should have joined the Air Force!
If we could get inside the saucer - use our torches - maybe we could cut the Shark loose?
Minus three.
Your friend was to remain where he was!
Of course.  But it is time to be- gin the return voyage --
Our 'Cyclops' throws quite a thunderbolt, itself!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Always has been.
I know he's due for the last two years. I was thinking of paying it when the insurance comes in.
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay for the fixin' of your car. A couple hundred for the clutch. I got some more bad news. Wanna hear it?
Tell me.
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
He's a Selectman. The town. He said to tell you to turn your badge in and clean out your office. I'm supposed to pull the CB and police light out of your car. They're town property.
I plan to. Soon.
How soon?
Yeah.
This is gonna be one fucking mess to clean up. Twombley's son-in-law and daughter are up the weekend. Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
Wonderful!
You played for the Sox?
Double A. New Britain.
The only difference between me and that Clemens on TV is luck, shit luck.
What happened?
Ruined my arm. Brought me along too fast. Why'd it have to be my fucking arm, I used to think. Then I realized it had to be somebody's fucking arm.
You only got a little while if you want your hundred bucks.
Where's that gun you were bragging on today?
In the chest.
Yeah.
On your sleeve.
Do what?
Break stuff?
But it's not funny now.
It's not that.
Oh, Jesus, come on, will you? Don't mess this up anymore than it's already been messed up. Join the other kids. Do that and before you know it you'll be as happy as a goddamned clam.
No.
Jesus. Listen, Jill, tell you what. Tomorrow morning, you still want to go home, I'll drive you down. I'll get off work or something.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
Jimmy took it. Jack's out hunting with Evan Twombley.
I'm not saying that.
That's what I love about a small town. You know everybody.
Twombley, Jesus. We got to get moving: I got to get up there. How would I know? C'mon, you drive. We'll take my truck.
I'm fine, fine.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
Wade, that wasn't smart. Going out right after the man's father-in-law shot himself. Let it go. Call it a favor to me.
You and Mel Gordon?
Could be.
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
Let the past be.  I'm sorry about your mother. I liked her. You never know how much women like that suffer. It's like they live their lives with the sound turned off -- and then they're gone.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Mel Gordon.
From Boston. Evan Twombley's son-in- law -- he was driving. I know where they're headed. Up the lake, Agaway. The old man's out deer hunting with Jack Hewitt, so they probably got some big weekend party planned.
Okay. She's fine.
Yeah.
I'm sorry about what I said.
I'm going to start one of those custody suits. I don't give a fucking shit. You know?
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
I've been wondering if maybe Jack shot Twombley, instead of Twombley shooting himself. I've been wondering maybe Jack shot him on purpose.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
What way?
I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
I don't know for Christ's sake!
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
There's a furnace.
You're not using it today?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
Well, yes, I'm... I want to say that I'm real sorry about your father, Mrs. Twombley.
Well, yeah, I suppose. Sure. I just had a little business to settle with Mr. Gordon. I'm the local police officer.
What?
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang! That's what it sounds like. Not on purpose. I assume accidental.
No, he's out now. Somewhere on the mountain. I'd stay away from him if I were you. He's real pissed.
How you and Ma doing? Haven't seen you in town for a while.
I checked on her. She had the electric heater. Cold don't bother her as much as me. Which is why I give her the heater.
Call it what you want.
Yeah.
Wade?
Want to know what I think happened?
That it wasn't an accident.
Then who shot him?
Money.
Who'd pay him that kind of money? Not the mob. They got their own guys. Specialists.
Yeah, the guy with the BMW I told you about. I did, didn't I?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
Got it.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
We still got three MiGs running around and six more on the way.
If fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
My loyalty was never to my country.
Psychology. They're trying to unnerve us.
Over the Black Sea. I can probably get us to Turkey or Georgia.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Stand by.
What do you want with us?
Yes
Over my dead body.
If you put down the gun, I promise not to drop her on the way down.
Hold on, Alice.
You heard me.  You. Congress and cabinet heads.
We can't jump from here or at this speed. But if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
That isn't necessary.
What?
You haven't even driven a car since you took office.
Actually, sir, you could be that someone.
They're still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
But this is different, sir. You're the President.
Two... THREE. GO!
Okay listen, listen carefully. This is an emergency call from Air Force One. Who's there? Is the Vice- President there?
Did we tape the Duke game?
DO YOU SEE TEEM?
Bud, get wise to the political realities. The boys on the board are under a lot of pressure from the boys downtown.
I just wish it was that simple.
What is it, Mary?
Ask Simon.
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Elaine, what's going on?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
I think so.
Roger.
Yes, sir.
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
I bet Scraps is going to love Mercury.
No more kids yelling, 'Your old man's a thieving rapist'?
He's a boy dog.
Yeah.
He's carrying a bomb.
Death, death.  How about the first Thursday in March, ten o'clock.
But that's not a door.  The door's over there.
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
You don't have to thank me, I'm a nurse. This is my father, Dr. Barrington.
You don't have to excuse yourself.  I'm a nurse.  I understand.
No, I mean your head.  Sit down.  I'll take a look at it.  I'm a nurse.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
No. I'm from Washington, D.C. I'm a lobbyist for the Small Businessmen's Assocation.
Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
And the last thing he said to me, "Doc," he said, "Sometime when the crew is up against it and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go out there with all they've got and win just one for the Zipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Doc," he said, "but I won't smell too good. That's for sure."
I can't tell.
You can't take a guess for another two hours?
That's right.
Let's see now. The co-pilot had fish. What did the navigator eat?
Ted!
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Who wants to be first?
Okay, this is one of my favorites.
Huh?
Of course.
It's the little room at the front of the plane where the pilots sit. But that's not important right now. The first officer is ill and the Captain would like someone with flying experience to help him with the radio. Do you know anything about planes?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
I think you're just a little scared now, about what you might find once the lights go out.  A little scared... and a lot curious.  Maybe more than you want to admit.  But doesn't that turn you on, that curiosity and fear, swirling together?  Think of it as broadening your horizons.
I like my horizons narrow.
The young woman at the front said you might know where he is.
Show me.
You don't have squat.
I'm Sergeant Sykes, and this is Detective Jetson, Los Angeles Police Department.
You were partners with him on some Slag -- uh, Newcomer real estate thing.
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
With two BRI Sabot slugs in the chest.
Through the chest.  Rupturing both the primary and secondary hearts.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
Possibly.  Good.  Well, would you be willing to accept the theory, George, that... possibly... by examining the evidence from one case we might shed some small ray of light on the other?  Does that sound unreasonable to you?
Nothing.
She didn't know him.  But she said her son might.
Why'd I do what?
Three months.  We learn quickly.  We adapt.  It is our strength... what we were bred for, to adapt to hostile environments.
Our bodies do not assimilate the nutrients if the food has been cooked.
A man, a human, was wiring it to your car.  I didn't get a good look at him.  I must call my wife...
To the... to the beach?
Please, I must get out here.
No.  I cannot involve you.  This is not your concern.
If the drug is here, we must destroy it.
Tell me about it...
Casull .454 Magnum.  You're talking twice the impact energy of .44 Magnum hot loads.
I think you're gonna find he's taken the rest of his life off.
... They took the stuff out, all of it -- this afternoon.
The human?
It is. 
Let's go...let's go.  Cycle through!
Can't lock up...
That is the question of the hour.  We could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. An ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
I'm really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. Believe me, I'd prefer not to.  I may be synthetic but I'm not stupid.
Amanda Ripley-McClaren.  Married name, I guess.  Age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  Two years ago.  I'm sorry.
If I go.
That's not what I mean.  Gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they'll rupture the cooling system.
This is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. We can't just arbitrarily exterminate them --
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Okay, stand by in operations.  Let's go.
Not that tunnel, the other one!
Are you finished?  You okay?
I want you two walking the perimeter. I know we're all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. We've got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
Yeah.  I've noticed.
There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
What about me?
Because you'll be gone soon, like the others.  Like everybody.  You'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.
Cross my heart.
Why do they tell little kids that?
Look!
That's because I blew it out the Goddamn airlock!  Like I said.
Well, do you know where it's set, my dear?
Why?
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
I'm so relieved.
Yes, sir, that's the truth. But don't blame him. The fault is mine. I was too indulgent with him. But not again. Never again, I promise! I implore you - let me bring him back here. I'll make him give his word to serve you faithfully.
And how will you make him keep it?
Oh, Your Grace - I thank Your Grace! I thank you!
No, Your Grace! I mean with all humility, no. I would rather you dismissed me. It's obvious I don't satisfy.
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
I want to go!
No, I'm not playing this game.
Yes.
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
Don't be stupid.
Sssh. What is it? Tell me.
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
Stanzi!
Your father is dead.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
No one.
Really?
I see.
Some service deserves service in return. No?
Why you?
Leave him alone!
Oh, yes.
Do you know who I am?  This is my daughter. I am Frau Weber. We are favoured guests!
Call Herr Mozart! You call Herr Mozart immediately! This is insupportable!
You can't be Herr Mozart!
May I try it?
Cattivo again, Court Composer. Well, tell him, Mozart. Name us a German virtue.
I'm thinking about Herr Mozart. What is your view?
And the result satisfies.
Ah-ha.
What? On one hearing only?
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
I agree, Majesty, but I'm afraid it's not possible. The young man is still in the pay of the Archbishop.
In my opinion, it is time we had a piece in our own language, sir. Plain German. For plain people.
Don't you have a maid?
How is your financial situation?
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
Good morning, sir.
I don't know. He has pains.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
That's right.
Animals?
Wolfi!
No.
Is my pupil still anxious to learn the art of music?
What for?
Ah, love! Well of course in Italy we know nothing about that.
So you see, this post is very important to me right now.
Sommer? Herr Sommer? But the man's a fool! He's a total mediocrity.
It has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.
Come, come, Mozart; I'm interested. Truly.
Ah. Italian?
Forgive me. We all have patriotic feelings of some kind.
You burned the score?
But there are those who have power over him. I think I'll take this up with the Emperor.
With all my heart, Mozart.
Oh no, the honour would be all mine.
I never knew that music like that was possible.
What work?
What dead? Who is dead?
A man who deserved a Requiem Mass and never got one.
I'm taking you home. You're not well.
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
I'm too young to be so sick.
My dear friend, it would be my greatest pleasure.
Then, let us try together. I'd regard it as such an honour. Tell me, what is this work?
The end of the Recordare - Statuens in parte dextra.
Come. Let's begin.
Also identical?
Yes, and on 'dictis'.
What is what?
Is the Emperor angry with me?
Naturally, the Italians! Of course! Always the Italians!
Mozart -
Show them one interesting modulation and they faint. Ohime! Morbidezza! Morbidezza! Italians are musical idiots and you want them to judge my music!
Must I? Well, I won't! I tell you straight: I will not!
I do not seek forgiveness.
Then you must know this.
Is it true?
Oh yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Always the same stale answers!  There is no God of Mercy, Father. Just a God of torture.
His funeral - imagine it! The Cathedral, all Vienna sitting there. His coffin, Mozart's little coffin in the middle. And suddenly in that silence, music. A divine music bursts out over them all, a great Mass of Death: Requiem Mass for Wolfgang Mozart, composed by his devoted friend Antonio Salieri. What sublimity! What depth! What passion in the music! Salieri has been touched by God at last. And God, forced to listen. Powerless - powerless to stop it. I at the end, for once, laughing at Him. Do you understand? Do you?
I poisoned his life.
My son, why should you want all Vienna to believe you a murderer? Is that your penance? Is it?
Yes?
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
Did we?
Of course now. Right away, before I get any older.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
How did he look?
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
I beg your pardon?
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
Aw come on, Alex!
I dream of death mostly.
How old are you?
I know.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
Lovely.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
I'm freezing.
I should be committed.
Jack is dead!
David, let's go now.
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
No, David. Harry and I and everyone you murder are not dead. The undead.
Oh, come on, tell us.
What are you going to see?
Some, everyone does.
You're in a hospital in London.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Good.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
You're talking about the woman I love.
That's a wolf's head.
I have no idea.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
What was it?
Let's just keep walking.
Are you going to help me up?
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
Get out of here, Jack!
Jack, are you really dead?
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
Roger Mathison, Doctor.
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
I beg your pardon?
Yes - sure—
I was the first one to see it. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
About twenty-four thousand.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Just pure luck!
That sounds very simple, Dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
We've been waiting fifteen minutes—
You know what you can do with that! Come on, take a look at this! You'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
Looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. What was the lady's name, Mr. Cluett?
He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
Gambling - I owed them a lot of money. Last week I lost over fifty thousand dollars!
Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
I want to be near you!
Cyril!
What are you doing here?
You've no right to do this to her, Mr. Cluett. Why don't you think it over? It's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
That makes it unanimous. I feel all right too.
Yes.
But I have to go, dear. It's a very important banker's meeting.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Listen, it isn't so terribly important. We can go to the theatre any time.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
Helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. What are we going to do about it?
Good morning, Mr. Dickson.
Got my letter?
I haven't any.
You're protecting somebody.
Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Well . . . uh . . . I . . .
Aw, I don't know what you're talking about. All I know is that you're losing your bank and—
How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
Yes, sir.
All right. Send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
Yes, sir. But soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
It's his life insurance money, you know.
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless!  If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
Hardly.
The ten dollars.
Oh, Charlie again.
Can you imagine that guy? He was kissing her.
Okay, honey - but just the same I'd like to take a crack at that—
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes, why?
I didn't do it! I haven't got a gun!
Yes.
Yes.
You've got enough?
I guess so.
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
I say we ride into town and kill us some Pinkertons and railroad men.
Cole, we're outlaws. Not exactly the most respectable job, if you know what I mean.
The Army can hang him.
Not yet. But I'm hoping.
We oughta take some of this, give it to our neighbors in Liberty. Lot of people hurting up there.
There's Yankees back there. Lot's of 'em.
She got two of them.
All the posters and newspapers are calling this bunch the "James-Younger Gang."
That's it.
Then let me run the show, General Lee.
Clell, Tom, go get Doc Mimms in Liberty!
Hmm. Go back to the reservation and get drunk in a dirt shack, or work for you...
Soon as I hit one, the other'll know and beat us up.
Oh. Why didn't you just say so?
What is it?
When have you ever known Old Man Tucker not to be yelling at everybody?
It's fine by me, Jesse.
I think he's already feeling better.
So we got a plan?
Pff. They hardly even noticed you.
Such as?
Zee, we got to talk to you and your father.
Think about this. If we just come up with a story and stick to it, we should be all right.
You are a charmer.
What do you think?
Don't care.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
We're doing this for Ma.
He was a boy riding with the most famous outlaws in the West. How was he supposed to say no to that?
See you soon. Oh, and I appreciate the distraction back there.
How much of that story is true?
No! I mean, of course not. No.
Let the law --
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
That's why I picked it. We can start a whole new life down here.
Swimming. Swimming is good.
So I'll get a fair trial in front of a jury bought off by Thaddeus Rains?
I went myself to oversee the operation. Didn't help much.
No, I'll hang you.  But I may miss you just a bit.
He's too important, James.  They'll set the army on you. You and your wife.
Thank you.
Who needs to repair a leaky church roof.
Hell yeah! I been with...  Uh, not exactly. It's just, I don't want to get one of these paid ladies, you know?
Oh, you were talking to Jesse.
I just though you were awful cute.
Thank you, Miss -- ?
Move you fools!
Two weeks ago, we managed to arrange to have the Army hang one of the local farmers.
This is no game.
In English, Pinkerton.
Why, their intense hatred of you, of course.
This is Dorsia?
Pull out, goddamnit!
What do you want, Courtney?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Why?
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip –  to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
That's nice.
You never noticed.
Isn't that special?  Patrick?
Evelyn?
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work.  You have a little something on your upper lip.
We never really shared one.
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
No.
Yes, naturally.
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
Davis. I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn't fully appreciate it. I wasn't fooled for a second. Now, if you'd said Price, or McDermott...Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.
What are you talking about? Bateman is what?
Wait. Stop. You don't seem to understand. You're not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it, Carnes. I'm Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen's fucking head off. I tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was true.
Lucky, I guess.
Your compliment was sufficient Luis.
Commes des Garcon.
Where are you going?
Is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  Oh my God...
New card. What do you think?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Impressive. Very nice. Let's see Paul Owen's card.
Two at nine? Perfect.
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
Just...say...no.
Thanks, Patrick.
Who?
Can you bring Mr...
Oh no. I have no plans.
Well, isn't this a coincidence.
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Jean? What?
Where are you?
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
That's...that's too bad.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you.
Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with chocolate.
Listen, if you could talk to them  I would really appreciate it. I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment at Hubert's in fifteen minutes.
Oh, I don't know, Victoria. I'm at work all the time.
Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a Saturday?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive?
Does he do this all the time?
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
Twenty-six. I'll be twenty-seven in October.
Nice. Very nice.
You seem...nervous.
No, I guess it's okay.
No problem. 
Hmmm.
Well, I've had a hard time getting an actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert Ainsworth for Paul, so...
No, it actually hadn't. Toiletries were missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That's it.
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Eerie. Really eerie.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
So...you hang out here a lot?
Not really.
God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes.
That's not the information I've received.
Well, I could he wrong.
So who was he with?
I'm not...
I'm hungry.
Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold.
I can't...I can't find a shelter
Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?
You'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
I can paint anywhere.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him.  It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Didn't you visit the campus?
I forgot. That's why you have to help me decide.
He gave me some new code-fixes this morning. I said, "Did you really do this just today?" Cause I was impressed. He said "What're you implying?"
Nothing.
Remember Lyle Barton?
It's gonna get cold.
That'll be a test, won't it?
Lisa's an extremely valuable member of the Skywire team. We've got our eyes on her. You keep yours on Milo.
Prick.
I am. I am, sir.
'Thought if I relocated it could help my case. I'm writing programs for the local public access station. Where any whack-job with 100 bucks gets his own show? God, does it suck.  Can you help me?
'Forgot to introduce you.  I have a girlfriend.
What?!
We could move 'em up here.
Well -- you sent for me.
34,000. But they're real short lines. 'Just came out that way.
...My dad was a compulsive gambler. Only he didn't think he was. That applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "Losers," who played games of chance. He could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. No matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. And you'd better not point out the obvious.  His creditors would catch up to him. Loan sharks or whatever. He'd wake us in the middle of the night. Off we'd go, again.
Don't be so hard on yourself. With a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em I bet.
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Longitude 109 --
Any irregularity in the pattern.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
She saved my life.
Why would you do a thing like --
No, no. Never.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
They know I broke in. Alice helped me.  Shrot's not one of them. He's blundering into this on his own.
That's lame, isn't it?
Outpost made me sign 1,000. 'Guess we'll find out what else we have to talk about. Life stuff.
Unless it's a diversion. Milo's in my office. He was tailgating, so I --
We're all grateful for that. Really. Go out the way you came in?
You may.
Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know.
Sak-i it to me!
Hungry.
Smashing!
Be careful.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
You mean Mrs. Kensington?
Be careful.
Thank you, Exposition.
Yes?
Where is Vanessa, by the way?
Be careful.
Indeed... If we could get back to the business at hand. It's one thing to have a warhead, it's quite another thing to have the missiles to launch it.
Good God, and underground missile. We've long feared such a development.
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
I think if everyone were honest, they'd confess that the lady looks exactly like a man in drag.
I'd say that about sums it up, Exposition.
Good on ya, man.
That does not compute.
Why not? It's a question.
No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination. We were innocent, man. If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man.
That's why right now is a very groovy time, man. We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility.
Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster.
My wedding tackle.
I'm sure.
I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling.
Here, use mine.
I couldn't have another bite.
Why?
No, this is me in a nutshell.
Oh, yes you are.
Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious feeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina. I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse. It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused... well, jealousy. I'm sorry.
Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic.
It was just a shag, Vanessa. You're everything to me.
Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night.
Smashing idea! Give it to me.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time.
Right.
Please allow me to demonstrate.
But what if he escapes? Why don't you just shoot him? What are you waiting for?
I just don't see it.
Of course not. I was married to your father.
I don't wanna take over the family business.
Scott.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Of course. Natural weather delivered to your door on demand. Down your phoneline. For limited periods.
No need. I'll call again.
Three days.
Have we met?
You mean you don't recall??
You need treatment, Mrs. Peel.  You can't resign.
We want to help...!
The death of Peter Peel was a great loss. To us all ...
The doors and walls are monitored, Mrs. Peel. This is a very secure establishment.
So am I.
Dr. Darling, Peter ... all you ...
An unholy trinity ...
Of course. I planned that, too.
'Our revels now are ended.'
The result would be ...
1922. Why the kippers?
Much better.
Not all Tradition is bad, Mrs. Peel. No thank you.
That's predictable. When I find a queen in need of protection I'll let you know.
I wasn't about to.
But that's absurd. I may not be over-fond of you, Steed, but it's not my style.
Well, he was a fellow of the Royal Zoological Society ...
That's what we were working on.
Then a mad millionaire. Head of a secret defense establishment. A group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
Not that I know of.  Explanation?
Oh, well ...  Just my type, Mrs. Peel.
Orders.
Not for a moment.
I'm playing to win.
I equivocated. But you're not their big worry at present. It's Dr. Darling:  he's disappeared ...
Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
Hurry?  What for?  I'm just now --
You didn't tell her?
When all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ...
Pity your mother came, too ...
Half-brother to be precise.
Very good, Mrs. Peel ...
You didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.
She may not know. Theory goes she may be very ill.
Insane ... ?
No. Her husband, she says. Alice tried to warn us. A trap. Tell Mother beware. Tell Father That's all.
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
Let it be rain, please let it be --
But did they teach you this?
That's not playing by the rules.
Come, come. You don't really expect me to fall for --
What do you mean?
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
No.
I'm marrying Debbie.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
But how can I do that?
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Right.  Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
Sorry, I can't hear you. Some pin head's yelling...  Shut up, I'm talking here.  Now look, I want you to go back and I don't care what you do. Stop that marriage.
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
Oh... I got something for that.
What's the matter?
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
Um... that's very relaxing.
Gonna get married...
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
You're really pissing me off.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
You're on.
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
I know what I'm doing... Go!
I've had it, numb nuts... How much money you got?
Why?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
Milt?
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, who serves?
Mr. Thomerson, I...
Rick!
Oh, no!
The phone made me do it!
Mrs.?
I'm separated.
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
C'mon. I insist.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
I'm proud of you, lad.
Still drawing a blank.
Take care.
They were killing firemen, man. When Sally showed me what was in Swayzak's files... They were my friends, I had to do it. I had to do it for the department.
There's a fire. We've got a job here. Let's get on with it.
If you do it like that it'll open in the fire. Then you'll get burned and DIE.
It's old stuff Adcox gave me that the department was going to throw out anyway. Still good enough though for this tub.
It works.
Yeah? What about Laura --
I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
-- C'mon, Stephen.
Hey.
No, Lt., I don't have a problem with drilling. But let's just have one drill. Not one for the company and one for me.
I waited... I would have fucking waited...
You're selling dad's boat?
Yeah, it's just another memory in my life right now. And I got way too many of them...
I don't know, Brian... I don't know...
I'll handle it.
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Boss and I are up to about three words an hour.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
Homey.
I wanted to be a good one.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Just take it.
I don't have the slightest idea...
Hey, do I know you?
Sure you do.
Very good, Brian. -- About your report here. The way to a torch's heart is through his tools. That's how you know him. It's the way he talks to the fire. And to you if you listen.
Look, everybody remembers your old man. Being his son, all you had to do was breathe to graduate here. Dead Hero Father Rule. But you blew us off. Why should I take you back?
See you Monday. Sir.
I think we should get something straight here. I was assigned to this office by the city.
-- Another backdraft.
No it couldn't.
I just re-wrote your contract. C'mere...
I don't guess.
But he killed these guys.
That's why the sealant on the doors... So what have we got, a torch with a conscience?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Uh, I think there's been a mistake. I didn't save that woman.
Every little boy's fantasy.
I have a job.
Not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, Brian. This could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.
Nice boat.
What the hell are we waiting for?
Engine 115, right?
Didn't offer the kinda growth and challenge I need.
Give up, babe. You can't fight it. Believe me, my mom tried...
-- You remember.
Didn't think you'd make it.
And old ladies?
I deal with this stuff every day. But a fireman... you never get used to it.  What happened up there? He was a candidate. Did he pay attention? Was he listening?
I need to get in the trunk.
Holcomb? I didn't know the name of that victim had even been released yet.
Investigator...
Yeah? At least she's alive! I see people get killed every day! Worse yet, tortured first and then killed! The nuns got off easy. Jeez. Cigarette burns. Everyone's all upset about fucking cigarette burns. I'll show you cigarette burns!
Nah...
Yes.
I was gonna bring it back myself.
He wants to know who brought in the chalice.
You're a fucking joke, you know that?  He's been waiting for the money since the fucking game ended. And I've been waiting here since -- forget it. Listen up. You're gonna get us both fucking killed. You know that!
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
B-L-A-K it is.
Yo Black, you looking for trouble.
That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout! That'swhatI'mtalkin'bout!  I want to be the first to welcome you to the second taping of Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show.
There is a name, a term for your kind, the likes of you.  Back in slavery days, you would be classified as a house nigga.
That's mighty black of you.
Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid.
Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players.
You're now Mantan.
I didn't find out about this very important staff meeting until...
The name of the show?
It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial.
Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again?
This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy."
So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing.
I gots to go, it's my Moms.
My game is still strong.  No Viagra for me, don't need no chemicals. Just my tonic.
I thought you had promised Mommy you stopped.
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
We both lied to him.
Just don't lie to me.
A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
Oh, is he?  You getting jiggy with Mantan?
You sound like the media.
Tomorrow it will be all about cruelty to animals or some sex scandal.  Besides, there is no such thing as bad publicity.
Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
He said that?
You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me?
You know how your Daddy is.
Thank you very much.  I always try my best.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
I thought you got rid of...
I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner.
That's what I like about you and me. We git along...
...like fried and chicken...
How be dat?
I don't know who I am.
Well, I'll be an Alabama porch monkey's uncle.
You don't read, do you?
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
For what?  He left.  Not me.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Don't try to change to the subject.
You know the use of arms very well, Best, and no one can doubt your courage; but Michael and I will see you home for all that.
Well, well!  What is it?  We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.
It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady.  If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.
What is your uncle's name?
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur.  He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life.  Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul.  As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight.  You are no match for Best with the sword.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes.  I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
All Europe shall hear of this!
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point.  The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know.  Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet.  As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please.  And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
That's very kind of you, Mr. O'Higgins.
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill?  Are you serious?
May I be quite frank with you?
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Yes?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Well, why not a milkmaid's daughter? No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance.  For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me?  A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power.  My wife never comes near me.  What friend have I?  None in the wide world.  Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
I am sorry for you Mr. James.  I'm grieved to keep you or any gentleman waiting.  Had you not better to arrange with my doctor or get the cook to flavor my omelette with arsenic?  What are the odds, gentlemen, that I don't live to see Mr. James hang yet?
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
You know the law -- no liquor before noon. Could lose my license.
You're under military arrest, it's not gonna happen. What's wrong with baseball?
I'm serious --
You saw West's body.
Sir, yes, sir!
I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him!
Why?
So did we. Why didn't you come?
Why?
Maybe, but that don't make me a killer --
We're sweeping our area and suddenly he's gone. Couple minutes later, phosphorous grenade pops off about a third of a click away --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
Becoming a morphine addict during Basic ain't exactly something you want to broadcast. Only Mueller and Childs know.
His chest was hamburger --
This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
Where are they!
Maybe --
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
Okay, then let's widen the search to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car --
JAG gets here in three hours. Try for the confession.
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
You're drunk --
You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
Subtlety really isn't one of you finer points, is it, Osborne?
Something like that.
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the object of the interrogation is to make you look good -- Everyone knows good cop, bad cop -- by admitting it I appeared trustworthy.
You're right. We should sit in silence.
You had a mobile of bayonets above your crib.
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
He's telling the truth, up to a point.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Little bit.
Now I go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
Get in.
Nah.
The faggot speaks.
He whispered it in my ear.
Where's your shirt, Mueller?
Gets on his plane in ten minutes, which means you two are done. You'll understand if I don't walk you out.
So forget what you've seen on Sixty fucking Minutes about the kinder, gentler military -- you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!
Who is she? Where does she live?
Why?
This town is everything a man could ask for. And if I were to end up here, I'd consider myself lucky. But the fact is, I'm not ready to end up anywhere.
What the hell are you doing? This is my girl. Mine!
A thousand times. He caught an uncatchable fish.
Eighteen.
And from the moment I saw her until the moment I die, she's the only one.
Stop.
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Oh, so you know.
I have been nothing but myself since the day I was born. And if you can't see that, it's your failing, not mine.
How I go.
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
There's a lot of expectation. I don't want to disappoint my fans.
That's great, Norther. I'm happy for you. I can't believe I helped.
You didn't become crazy.
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
You don't have to.
That's because most of it never happened.
He's up with your father.
Yes.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Yes. Thank you.
You know what for.
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you want to stop?
You're asking for my documents?
Uh. Do you like England?
No. It's not that.
Good night.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Yes.
You don't understand anything.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
Why not?
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You didn't mind too much.
Not really. Maybe a little.
She's dead.
Please.
Thanks.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
I need to uh...
No. No, she can't go. Mean to say... they's just no money fo'a doctor. Her daddy left for a job, and uh... give her to me to look on. I just...  I don't know what to do.
Oh, she older than that.
That'd be nice.
You seen my snake-skin shoes?
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Hey.
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
You gonna miss your bus.
Now wait...
Make yourself at home. You done it already.
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Carryin' on behind my back. Make me out to look like a fool to all our people. Tell me, what's friendly about that?
My Daddy told me that a younger woman would bleed me dry. And that's what you did. Ya bled me.
You sayin' you'll do what?
Son, I'm grown. Don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. I'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. So let's have it. End me or get out of my face!
Don't need none.
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
What?
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?!  WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
God saw to it to put you in my path. And I aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
Whose doin' is that?
Uh-uh.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Nothin'.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know that.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes.  Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love.
Well, this one's yours now. You ready to take care of it?
Nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. And you know what? I'm good at it. Naw what I mean?
Ain't gonna be moved?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
Put yo'self in my shoes. Say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. I been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
The fuck are all these people doin' here? Been drinkin' in this shit hole for years ain't seen this many people since I don't know...
Get me ten bags of mulch.
Well, dig in, son. Got plenty to eat.
That's right.
Rae don't do this now...
Yeah, I know.
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
Are you wasted?
What?
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Alright. How much you need, ho?
The hell you call me?
-- Cavello.  Ronnie Cavello.
Charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
Saving your life.
No.
In Rome, I'll bow.
First decent idea you've had.
Cool?
If you give me one.
Where would you look for the mafia?
What's the problem here?
I don't, that's all.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
He says they're very nice.  He wants to know if you have anymore.
Only one way to find out... Get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
You were too far behind.
I want to yank Kobo.
I'll be a nice Gaiijin.
Big enough.
No.
We need the plate to negotiate with.
Unavailable.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
You could fake it.
What do you chant?
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
Save it, I already took the tour.
She's such a long way home for you.
Time, I've got plenty of.
Dope?
He's wanted in Japan.  They want him first.  Then we can have him.
They're blaming it on you.  Christ, Conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
Do you know what this is?
Why don't you ask your chief detective?
Look.
-- Do you know where she is, detective?  Do you know how to find her?  Even where to start?  We will find them.
Goodbye, officer.
Pris?
Anywhere.
Not to be trapped.
That wouldn't be very sporting.
Death.
If we don't find help soon, Pris hasn't got long to live.
Tyrell could help us, Sebastian.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
When?
Then let her get away.  I thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
This is Bryant.  Are you alone?
I think we're through for the night.
But I would like to buy you drink.
I'm taking a piss.
No rust?
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
Meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
Huh huh.
Yes?
Of course.
You talking about the Opera House on the Main?
Silicone Valley.  Lots of these science guys never leave that place.  We book two shows a month in there. Those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
Where is he?
I wish I could.
Like?
Never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
Because it's not.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Go ahead.
Have you ever retired a human by mistake?
How do you know I'm not?
What desert?
Know what a turtle is?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Yes?
I'm Adam Webber.
Come where?
It certainly is.  I agree with you completely.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
It was amazing.
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
You don't?
And that's it?
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
What's the pay?
Name it.
Then forget it.
May I please be excused?
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
I'm really sorry!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
Goodnight!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Of course.  I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
My pleasure.
It was at least as good as the sky.
See! I can't tell them that!  I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  I can't let that happen.  You understand?
I know it has been terrible.  But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
Yes.
No. Sit down.
No, son! We wait for night.  Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Merci!
Adult Bookstore.  Why?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
That's what everybody believes?
It's so small.
True.
Almost all of them.
I LOVE THIS!!
So, did you buy a movie?
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
Really? No kidding?
Oh, you got a problem with that?
I'll be all right.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
He drank it hot?
Yeah.
Yes, I can tell that just looking around.  "Boy?"  Did you say you were a "country boy?"
Well, put it down and come in!
Yeah, yeah. Okay.  Give me the roast and watch your step.  I'll come back for the radio.
The locks?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
What shall we call him?
Coming!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
I'm not sick.
Hey, I brought some friends. And some beer.
You did? A human ear?
Excuse me, Mrs. Williams.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Jeffrey.
Nobody.
You said hello, to Frank. You wanted to talk to someone? Don? And little Donny. You said something about Momma loves you. And something about a Meadow Lane. Something in an hour. I don't remember any more.
No.
You can be my special friend and come and put that in me.
OK.
Falling.
No. But you're in very big trouble.
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. If you need to, come to where I live, OK?
Whatiya mean?
Okay. I know you've been scared. Now you want to scare someone.
Shut up.
Beeeee careful.
You put your disease in me. Your semen. It's hot and full of disease.
What?
I'm getting a little bit fat. I hate that.
No way, get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Okay, I'm goin'. You'll see, I'll get you.
You want to see him too, right?
Yes, but.
Here's to Ben.
Nothing.
Okay Frank.
There ya go.
Jeffrey, honey. Your father's condition is serious. It's going to cost so much. We just won't have the money to keep you in school. I'm telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do, it'll save you another trip back. You're going to have to work at the store.
I've made arrangements with Dr. Gynde for 10:30. But Jeffrey, you'll have to walk over; I need the car this morning.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Alright.
Terrible boring.
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces. I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear, there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
I don't know, you're not supposed to see them. They're supposed to see you.
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
You will be a Jehovah's Witness. I have a few "Awake" magazines for you. You don't have to keep her very long. A few seconds is all I'll need. Whatiya think?
Let's go.
Why not?
Okay, yeah, call.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else, you know what I mean?
OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. This is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. They have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. The ears were for her a warning to stay alive. There is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". You saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
What am I going to do?
Yeah, you're a mystery. I like you. Very much.
No.
What is it?
It's okay.
Thank you. Whatiya say we just enjoy the evening?
I can't dance fast.
Let's wait for some slow one.
Probably not. No. Why?
Okay. Let's get her over to your father's.
Stop it Mike.
I need Il Duce.
Well... what if your boss knew how many guys were supposed to be there... in that room?
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
I want ta tell ya one last thing before I pull the trigger.
Well, I didn't but...
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We paid attention in school.
I'll see what I can do. How do I get in touch with you?
Aye.
"I'm afraid we can't let that one go, Ivan."
German.  Not in our neighborhood, man. A hundred percent Irish. No one talks to cops. Period.
Just like on TV.
We'll find it. Just calm down.
Oh, you're good. What were you gonna do? Laugh the last three to death, funny man?
So, when are you getting a plastic fuck doll?
A-fuckin'-men!
And he is one smart man.
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.
Rule of thumb?
Three.
Where's my cat?
My, my...
Peeperman? WRONG? What color was it?!!!
New hitman wants to leave his mark
They shot him at a downward angle.  They put him on his knees.
Well, we didn't get any help on that. A lot of people saw it. Nobody's talking.
Why do you always disrespect me like that?
Don't kill me. Oh shit, please no. I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man!... the funny man... the funny.
Roc. You okay?
Roc. You okay?
Those cocksuckers sold me out!
Why have I come to a church? I never have before. I guess I just... felt I should.
No. They would never do that.
He says, "What's your third wish?" And the guys says, "I-I want you to beat me half to death."
Gimme the fuckin' thing. Now sit the fuck down!
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
No. This is he.
Every valuable item in the house was on that list.
That's not what I meant, Dignan.
Where's the other stocker?
Like I'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
Anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. He got what he deserved.
I didn't realize you were so sensitive to Bob's feelings. Considering I did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
Dignan, those aren't running shoes.
Don't call me spoiled, Dignan.
On your marks...  Get set go.
It's not a plan. It's just --
Inez, this is --
Jerry.  And this is my associate Cornelius.
They don't?
No. Not really. Inez speaks a little.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Right here.
If you wanted to go? What were you going to do? Just leave me here by myself?
I didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, Dignan.
Would of been nice.
I know.
Her name's Inez. Stop calling her the housekeeper.
Ah. Couple days ago.
What the fuck are we doing out here?
Take your second position.
What?
I'll see you there.
Behind Bob's house.
Shhh. Wait for my instructions.
What?
Nice to meet you.
That's a sharp jacket.
How'd he do?
No, that door over there.
Because I was like you once. And there was no one there to help me.
Pot is an herb. It's just like any type of gardening.
It's private property. Plus I have Hector.
Nobody does.
I'm not playing any more golf.
Yes. You just got to stick with it.
That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
It was stupid.
Temporarily.
You're Anthony?
Feel this.
The front stairs.
Is that Buckethead?
Wait a second.
Can you use a coaster.
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
You should take a look. I have an entire crop in my backyard.
Good question.
Be cool, Bob. Be cool.  Make that light.
There were more than that.
What are you talking about?
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
Since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? Everybody has a scale.
Then how come they haven't set the bail yet? That's unconstitutional.
Dignan, he's my brother. I can't just leave him there.
I can't do that, Bob.
I know it's not.
I know it, man. Hang on.
Do you have your own cell?
No. I have a cellmate. His name's Carl.
Yeah. Hey, Clay.
He said what?
Why?
No, if I go out on this job, then it's just another score by Mr. Henry. And I don't see it like that. This is your job. Your creation. I want you to try this.
He's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  Don't worry about it.
Got a little lucky.
She is a good looking woman.
What?
Come on in!
What?
That's not gonna fly.
I want to know about Treadstone.
No... It must have been Bourne.
Jesus... I, Zorn... I have to call his family. Tell them...
I'm sorry, Ward.
You killed them.
How... how can... how can you be here and say this?
Drop it.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
I don't know.
Pamela Landy?
I don't know who that is.
I'm sorry.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
But it ends up the same.
Tell me later.
I only dream about people who are dead.
Who is Pamela Landy?
I left a fingerprint! You fucking people.
Conklin! Stuff on Conklin! 
Please -- I'm only here because of Paris -- because they can't figure out what you're doing -- I'm here because of Abbott --
Abbott?
Ramstein Air Base, Germany.  Before the wall fell you would have woken up in a Russian prison hospital.
What's that?
I'm working on it.
Who's going? Us?
-- uplink all relevant files to Kim --  -- and I want them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone --
What?
What? The tapes?
I'm getting on a plane to Berlin in 45 minutes, which means you are going to call me back in 30, and when I ask you where we stand, I had better be impressed. My mobile number is...
You're making it out like we're friends here or something. I met him alone twice.
You mean, did I want a date?
Are we locked up?
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
So let the council swear publicly.
He was a modest man.
It will not be long before Longshanks too is encased in stone, and his crowns divided for others to wear.
But if we have not caught Wallace --
Wallace's followers.
Aye.
Your rest is making me exhausted.
They're English soldiers, ain't they?
Call it a test of soldiery, then. The English won't let us train with weapons, so we train with stones.
A common thief.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
It matters not, he is thy king!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
I don't want to scare you. I want to be yours, and you mine. Every night like this one.
I don't want to wake. I want to stay with you.
...I wouldn't know.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
SLAVES ARE MADE IN SUCH WAYS!
Nobles? What does that mean -- to be noble? Your title gives you claim to the throne of our country. But men don't follow titles, they follow courage! Your arm speaks louder than your tongue. Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you. If you would lead them toward freedom, they would follow you. And so would I.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
You'd be surprised how often they are.
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
But Lenny said that his dad's coming... and Tommy and Kayleigh's dad...
How long will I be in here?
You told me that on Parents' Weekend. Remember? Wait, that wasn't me. Or you.
Can you protect me?
I ain't bullshitting. Jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
Weirder than this?
Signs of the Lord. They just appeared out of nowhere. I thought you were loco!
Are you sure? Not even with my father?
This is bigger. Seven years to the day. No blackouts.
Oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
What do you want to know, Evan?
I walk differently?
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
The bottom. When you're just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
Different? How?
I never thought you would. That's why I've never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why I never will again.
Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
It'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. Ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. Nice work, daddy.
Who -- who are you?
Wow... read something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Shhh. I need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I'm gonna destroy it.
If I hadn't blown my arms off, Mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. Now shhhh.
Hold your horses, man. It's here somewhere. I saw it when I was a kid.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
I'll do whatever you want. You don't want me to ever see Kayleigh again, fine. Just let Crockett go. Besides, you kill him now and they'll stick you in juvy for sure. And I know you'd never leave your sister alone with your father.
Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke.
What? No frigging way, man. I'm not touching that thing.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Does he know that?
Yes, Monsieur.
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
I won't.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
Yes, something.
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Occupied France?
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
No.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
When did you first find out he was alive?
And I said I would never leave you.
Yes, ma'am.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
Be careful.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
I know how it is to be lonely.  Is there anything you wish to tell me?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Yes.
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...  were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
Not at all.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam.  I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
I said, ask your wife.
Yes.
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
I slept very well.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I see what you mean.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
-- Thanks. I will.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
What friend?
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
Well, she isn't just any woman.
Oh, thanks.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
Will I see you tonight?
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
Hello Ugarte.
I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you?
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
For how long?
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No.
You don't know where you are.  You missed the shipping lanes.
You idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
But I have promises to keep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  And miles to go before I sleep.  Got to fix the sea anchor.  Use the sail.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
You are.
Look again, asshole.  It's a mirage.
There was an unavoidable delay.
He was a sorry sonofabitch, and I'm sorry I ever married him.
A few things came up.  Or went down.
No, this is Jack.  Jango was hit by a UPS truck.  Can you believe it?
That's my sea anchor.  My second one. Made it out of part of the sail.  It keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  In theory.  And this, this I used to collect water. About half a cup a day.
Yeah?
Don't overwhelm me with the details.  You know how I hate that.
Cliches, mainly.  Don't take anyone for granted.  Don't sweat the small stuff. Live each day like it's your last.
I don't know.  I really don't know.
No.
That new roof, that's your doing.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
Kamal, you're breaking up.  Can you hear us?
Borrowed.  I borrowed it.
I'm touched.
Ninety five percent?  Just give me the money now.
Must have taken a hell of a long time.
To Wilson.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
I doubt it. She's just an...
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
Daddy, *please*...
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
Why?
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
They wanted a girl.
That's true.
He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
I don't think so, Homer. *I'm* the lucky one.
I guess so...
There ain't no *almost* about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Where'd she get you?
Right?
Obviously.
I don't know it.
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
So what?
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
When will he be home, Major?
Four weeks or so, right around Halloween.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
*You* taught her, I suppose...
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Well, typically, corporate loans are relatively simple matters, but you do need to demonstrate a capacity for gross fund recovery.
No, no. Nothing like that. I work in a bank.
I don't follow.
Everything looks in order.
There'll be red flags.
You need some convincing. Consider it a convincer.
Know who I am, Jake?
We can't all be model citizens such as yourself.
It's all about the money, isn't it?
So you want to know how to play the Big Con.
We got our stake. Now we need to find our guy in Gillett's bank.
You're a superstitious fucker.
Guess so.
We sure Big Al threw him to us?
It's alright. Grant's one of the good guys.
Probably some investment banker or convertible-bonds-broker-dickhead. Did you see how fast he ran out of here? It's done. He's not coming back.
Two million.
She's up for it.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
I need you to stake me. I can't do it without it. It's just a couple hundred grand. Taken out of our cut when we're done.
You're not going to bust out baby oil and start rubbing me down or anything, are you?
Thank you. Actually, it's our first anniversary this weekend. She thinks I'm here to pick up something for my mother, but it's actually a gift for her. Think I've fooled her?
Help me.
Just play a part. A little acting.
What?
Uh-huh.
Did I miss something?
For what? A couple hundred bucks?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
Are you asking me if I have something to prove?
How do you know I will?
I SAID, HOW DO --  Deal with that?
Yeah, the sensitive guy-thing never worked for me.
Glenn talked you out of it.
What about the money?
Your friend, Big Al? It should have been you.
If you wanna help, then help. If not, shut up.
Yeah, well we're still a little young for Albany State Prison. Are you pissed about Al? I'm pissed too, but I'm not like "twenty-five to life" pissed.
And we got rid of the red head.
You were right. He's trying to fuck you. You want it, you gotta get it at the airport...
Not easy pickin's. Papers like these speak to larger issues. Sorry about Alfonse.  You into something big?
You guys got sack, I'll give you that much.
Confidence. It's just confidence.
So do half the other people in this place. How do I know which one?
Good. Good. Do not let Vig out of your sight.
Not everyone's on the take, Walter.
Roger that.
You think this is a good idea? We never did this kinda shit before.
I'm down!
Put your hand down. I don't high five.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Sorry.
How about five hundred.
What?!
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
Habib?
Looking forward!
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
I want to hear it.
What job?
I'll see you in my dreams.
You're entitled to your opinion.
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
Gambling's not about money.
Then what?
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
The debts.
Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
Toss you for it.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
Let it go.
Did they tell you to sleep with me?
Bruise?  Oh, yes. It's better.
And what do you do, Lucy?
Are you going to put a spell on me?
Have you got transport?
Nice car.
How long have you worked at the casino?
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
Rough life, Jack.
Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.  Hey, you haven't changed your clothes!
What are you talking about? It's 11, I've won. With this lady.
Jack.
How?
Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
All right, Mr Reynolds.
Take your time. Two weeks. Three if you need it. We'll pay you sick leave. I don't want to lose you. You're a good man. Here...
The key!
I don't have it. I don't know where it is.
So don't give me any of that sentient life crap. Find me something I can blow up.
He just likes it up in the dome, that's all.
Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was weird.
Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8- 7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.
Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I read you, continue.
I am programmed to detonate in nine minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
Hey, bomb.
The only thing which exists is myself.
Intriguing. I wish I had more time to discuss this matter.
Because I must detonate in seventy- five seconds.
Ah, what was that again, I still can't hear you?
I said I'm trying to reach Talby. Something's wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter approximation.
I'll check it.
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Must get lonely being up here so much.
...Should spend some time below, see more of the rest of the ship...
The waves at Malibu and Zuma were fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit...
I really think I should try and locate it immediately. Might be something important.
Not now!
Guess you're right.
Negative effect.
Sorry, Doolittle. I've forgotten so much since I've been in here. So much.
Well, what you might try is --
Yeah.
I'm on a break.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
That's not why we're here.
Where?
Yeah, well around here, I'm the Most High... From now on, before you do anything, call in for instructions.
Later.
You didn't...
I don't want to move away.
You're lucky.  I almost pulled the trigger.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Girlfriend?
So, what, you just like the sound of your own voice?
You got a lotta nerve.
Only when I meet someone I have to know everything about.
I know they made me.  Even got the label on my neck to prove it.
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
I didn't make it this far by attracting a lot of attention.
Look, thank you for this but--
You don't want to.
None.
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
You drive away business roarin' in like that.
Only a last name would be nice.  Or the nearest town to this...clinic.
Bastard...
You and me both.
Got a pencil?
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
A fog bank.
Where?
Yeah, 'cause maybe he's learned his lesson.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Not right now?  Okay, when?
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
Probably a touch of what's going around.
You can tell 'em yourself tomorrow.
Later.
I gotta meet Natalie for dinner.
But I'll take a rain check...
Not half as pissed as she's gonna be when she finds out why I blew her off... I need your help, Max.
Lame, self-serving, arrogant...guilty as charged.
Hear me out.  This person I've been seeing is a Jam Pony client who happens to be married--
You set up on Lydia.  When she's on her way over to the apartment you give me the heads up.  I answer the door and pretend to be Natalie.
You don't.
Say the words, "I understand."
Shut-up...
I was on call. 
What's the difference if I'm on call here or deployed in the field.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
I'd be in a position to spend some money on you if you'd get in a position and spend some time on me.
I just told you, he's a big, hairy...
Well, shame on him if he doesn't.
Yeah, a man's drink...
Beth, I can't believe you just said that because that's exactly how I've always felt about you... Call me Jam. It's my band name.
Yeah.
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
Really, Jam, you tryin' to make us barf?
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Sunday, but...
Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Okay, one of us sneaks in, gets four ticket stubs off some kids in the audience, comes back out, and we all "re-enter" the concerto. Voila!
Still too risky for my money.  We're running out of time here. This is KISS! A victory for one is a victory for the team. I'm sure I can barter with a scalper, but if you dudes think you got better plans, go for it. We'll reconvene at that intersection...
Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
I'm really sorry about that, man.
Jam, shut-up! You're not allowed to speak, remember? Go use whatever femmy idea you have to get yourself a ticket or four. I don't wanna hear it.
Now don't forget you're on the honor system tonight. I'll be home a little after one and if you've been partying or playing that satanic KISS music... well, need I remind you of the consequences?
What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?
Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.
If your mom so much as smells those tickets, they're history, and we get screwed outta seeing KISS for the third year in a row, the third year!
All I got is five. The rest is in the Volvo.
What do you want?
Hello? Is this me? I'm Trip. Am I on the air?
I should hang up on you right now, but you're the right caller so answer quick or get your battleship sunk. What are the names of the four members of KISS?
That's all the gusta you can musta? I said, "Good morning!"
Donnie. Donnie Darko.
Did you know him?
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
Uhh... sure. And in order for the vessel to travel through time it must find the portal, in this case the wormhole, or some unforeseen portal that lies undiscovered.
If God controls time... then all time is pre-decided. Then every living thing travels along a set path.
What did you say?
Who is... we?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Sure.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
I'm sorry. I was in jail once.  I accidentally burned down this house. It was abandoned. I got held back in school again. Can't drive until I'm eighteen.  I think when I grow up I want to be a painter. Or maybe a writer or maybe both. Then I'll write a book and draw the illustrations like a comic book. You know, change things.
That's easy. Antiseptics.
Don't knock soap. Without it, disease would spread rapidly. If we ran out... you and I would never live to see the year 2000.
That was a compliment.
I'm going home.
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
My mom is gone.
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
The Lifeline is divided that way.
No, a year of partying is enough. She'll be going to Harvard this fall.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
Good Lord.  So the construction guys say it'll take about a week to fix the roof. Damn airline better not fuck us on the shingle match.
Grandma Death.
Of course. A rabbit is not like us. It has no history books... it has no knowledge of sorrow or regret. I like bunnies and all. They're cute... and they're horny. And if you're cute and horny... then you're probably happy that you don't know who you are... or why you're even alive. But the only thing I've known rabbits to do is have sex as many times as possible before they die.
Donnie... it's Friday. Shouldn't you be off with your friends, scaring old people?
What do I tell the rest of the class when they ask about you?
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
I... I was playing with fire.
But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
What else makes you feel regret?
It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
Frank is going to kill.
I was just being honest.
Well, Jim, I think you're full of shit!
He died, remember? On the way to the prom.  He was doomed.
The PTA is here to acknowledge that there is pornography in our school's curriculum.
Beg pardon?
You know, there's, like, this rule. We get to go home at 7:55.
I stole four beers from my dad.
Where is she?!
Really, Loretta?
Okay.
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
"Here," wh-wh-what?
Then do it for Peter. Mrs. Leeman used to call him a "skinny little fag" when he'd bag her groceries. He'd pop his Nancy-belt if his old jacket somehow, I don't know, got her back.
Oh... How quickly they grow up.  Hey, if they ask you to take off your shirt, get the money first.
Let me tell you "scary," Amber. Look at me. Do you wanna look like you been rode hard and put away wet at my age? I'm a "lifer" here. Best I can hope for is to end up in a descent "raisin ranch" where they'll change me twice a day.
Amber Atkins! That is not American Teen Princess language!
Yes...
Okay... well, bye.
Bye.
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
You don't know where this is gonna...
So? Be real easy.
What?
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Harold!
I want to have the big bag of little donuts.
There's your paint can. The next time you drink window cleaner, I'm just gonna leave it in ya.
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
I'm sorry, Dad, but with all due respect, my name isn't "Tina," it's Seiko.
He should be king!
Take a letter.
That doesn't sound right...  take out "President"...  now read it.
Is that all?
Never mind His Excellency -- you gotta your pocketbook?
I wanna powder my nose...
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
You told it to me.
Oh, yes, I remember -- and I should have slapped Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me... I'm going right out and find Trentino.  You go right out and get yourself an army.
We've gotta have somebody who knows how to get secrets from men.  You know how to make love?
Why not?  You're the Secretary of War, aren't you?
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
That's the spirit -- fifty-fifty.
I'll keep the greetings -- but you can send back the good will... what we need right now is twenty million dollars.
Why yes.  I met you at the dog races -- say, you could have won that race if you tried a little harder.
You upstart!
Well, I won't stand for much.  And I won't stand for you if you don't show some improvement soon.  Look at your report card last month -- "D" in spelling...  six in behavior. Now who were the six?  A fine state of affairs -- no wonder you can't matriculate, now what were you saying?
You can call me Gloria too.  Gloria -- what a beautiful name.  When I was born my mother named me Gloria -- two minutes later she found out her mistake...
Take a seat -- you're next. 
WHAT  ?
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Maybe it's not going to be so easy. From what I've heard, Mrs. Teasdale is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.
That's where you come in.  I'll leave him in your hands, and don't forget you're supposed to be my niece.
Oh?
How lovely.
I've always thought that myself.
He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Am I a good man or am I a bad man?
Yes?
Shut up!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
He fell.  He falls.
You listen, you're not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. He's got the rale, he's very weak, and I don't know how much damage has been done by his "fall". Now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!
I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities!
Oh, is he a friend of yours?
Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
Not me, sir. Mr. Merrick. He succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
Yes, I think I can.
Well, it's up to us then, isn't it?
Frankly, Treves, it's not what I'd expected. A few small cheques. Well- wishers. Don't worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
Well... I'll let you know if there's something in the afternoon post.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Tell me about it, please!
No, but I certainly shall.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
y-y-yes--
It's alright, it was thrown away. No one wants it. It's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.
The main spire.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Yes!
Merrick...
Say "Mmmerrick."
Mmmerrick.
That's a canopy, John.
Yes, John.
Mr. Treves. Thank you my... friends.
Yes, very soon.
I'm glad, John. Goodnight.
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
No, he's very upset about something.
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Oh?... Well, quickly please, Mothershead, I'm overdue.
Well...
I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
There IS no one.
I said welcome.
Well, EVERYONE is friends here on Hy- Brasil.
What?
But surely you know...?
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
It was different...
We never went to bed together.
I've never been to bed with anybody!
"The fifth one this week"!
You're as bad as my father.
But, Erik...
No! WAIT! ERIK! The Cloak! The Cloak Invisible! It only seems to work on my father!
No... no...
We blew the Horn Resounding.
I shouldn't have come.
That I cannot tell you.
Now I want you to be ABSOLUTELY, totally, genuinely honest with me. Did you really, truly, honestly like it?
Yes?
I don't suppose... no...
And I was just saying that rape is no MORE pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
Odin!
It's always the women that start the trouble.
Make your mind up.
You may need a real Berserk.
You'll see!
So?
Trust me to get the missionary.
How about making friends?
It doesn't matter WHERE you sit!
She MUST have a knife or something...
Let me do something for myself for a change!
Bye... sorry...
He hasn't.
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
Oh, I couldn't do that! The Blacksmith's Code says...
The bottom falls out of the sword business!
You'll be able to throw it further than I could.
I'm drowning! Help!
Like you got rid of Snorri!
I was a Berserk for King Harald Fairhair...
But it's a responsibility...
But it's a responsibility being a Berserk.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
Not now, Sven...
It's no good going berserk against a dragon!
Sh!
Easy, Dad!
Neither am I.
No... he's not... not... there...
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
Yeah, you told me that later.
Okay, I guess.
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I'm Joel.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
I think about that.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
No.
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
That's scary sounding.
You should stay.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
What do you mean?
I'm right here.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
I love it!
Do you remember what we talked about?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
We did talk about Naomi.
I know.
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
I think she's great.
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
I love you.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
Have sex. Y'know --
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
Doesn't sound like me.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I probably got the same thing as you.
There are two of them. Couldn't make them out. The orange glow of a cigarette.
I'm like a joke to them.
Oh, God. I miss her. I can't believe she's with that guy now! I'm never going to see her again. I love her so much. What a fucking monster she is!
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
You take it. I don't know.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
In a minute.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Hi.
You found us okay?
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
Go.
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Welcome, Howard.
Well, thank you, Mary.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's no big deal.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Would you just try him? You never know. As long as I'm here. You never know.
Of course. Please have a seat.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
Easy come, easy go.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I don't.
About...
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Oh, we didn't get it all the way on.
What guy?
Here. I'll turn down the air conditioner.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum/Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
I heard it.
This is Cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
Hold on, Coop...
It worked for Weir. Prep the tanks.
I'd rather spend the next twelve hours Outside than another five minutes in this can. This ship is bad. It watches you.
You heard me. This ship, it's crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that's like the Tower of Babel.
We're still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
I don't know, the screens are dead...!
You're okay now, it's over...
There must be a way! What about Engineering?
"Another man?" Who?
No.
It sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "Hell."
Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor.
That doesn't mean a damn thing. They were looking for a scapegoat and Weir fit the bill. But he's not responsible for what happened to the ship.
Some things you don't get over.
What does?
"The dark inside..."? I don't understand.
Start the countdown.
Skipper, you gotta help me...
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
This is not about my reputation! This is not about me at all!  The Event Horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. Imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. Seven years ago, we didn't just lose the ship and the crew. We lost the dream.  I have to go.
Just loading the last of the CO2 scrubbers.  Good for four months.
Ice crystals everywhere. This place is a deep freeze.
Alive?
...you okay?
Yeah. I'm -- I'm okay.
Until then, do what you're told and stay out of my way.
They're empty, Dr. Weir. Moving forward.
I don't know.
That's bullshit and you know it! You built this fucking ship and all I've heard from you is bullshit!
I don't know...
We will take the Lewis and Clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the Event Horizon until I am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  Fuck this ship.
Son of a bitch!
I don't need them anymore. Where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.
One-four degrees...
Starck...
We have a situation here...
I'm here, Smith, how's the Clark?
Understood.
That's enough!
Alright. Prep the Clark for launch. I'll find her.
What is it, Smith?
No, no, we just got her back together...
Come around to three-three-four...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," don't you have anything useful to tell me?
I've got a theory.
We blow the Corridor. Use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. We stay put...
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Can you shut it down?
That's the Core: the gravity drive. The heart of the ship.
We're losing atmosphere...
The law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
Yes.
It must be hard, being so far away from her.
Tell me. When you grew up in Brooklyn, how many astronauts did you know?  You went your own way then. You didn't listen to people. So why start now...?
Wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.
I wouldn't be caught dead in that.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
I don't care about rocks, I care about you.  You bring him back in one piece, or you can forget being Best Man.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
No. I cannot take orders from that underwear model. That wingnut washed out of NASA for sneaking two Victoria Secret wannabes into a flight simulator.
I had it at four.
I should have done more, run more tests --
Well maybe you should date him.
Ben, I'm afraid I've got to ask --
Forget it, egghead. I'm good as is.
Let's see: you got Victor, stud of the year, more coin than God? Or Reed, the world's dumbest smart guy worth less than a postage stamp. Hmmm, it's a toss-up.
Like the shields Reed said would protect us.  How long?
I wish I could tell you. I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here. I'll notify the CDC and --
The cloud has fundamentally altered our DNA.
Please tell me you go silent too.
But Johnny... you can't fly.
It's not just the money. I could make money in my sleep.
Stable. We're looking at low twenties. It's a good number, considering the fallout from --
And that's a good thing?
What about you? You haven't eaten in days. How come you're never on this side of the microscope?
What in the world would give me that idea?
Why didn't you say something?
You remember in school we talked about working together. That's what I was about to explain...
You can't leave them out there.
Oh, I think you already have.
You want to work at Carl's?
On the ledge?
But you took off your Captain Kidd uniform.
I am so tired. I am so tired of dealing with morons. How hard is it to...
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
See you later.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
No.
Leave me alone.
Dad says!
He's my friend, too.
So are you.  Are you shaking?
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
Really?
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
It's happening right now. I'm here at the Atlantis. Everything's fine except... I left my wallet at home.
No. It's too late. The food is coming and everything. Damone, I've got to ask you this favor, and I'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. Will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
Whatever you say, Rat.
Sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
Yes.
I don't go at all.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
What should I do?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
It was okay.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Does that ever happen?
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
I paid for it and everything.
Really?
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
All right! Oh, yeah!
Thanks. So do you.
Yes.
Oh... yes.
Yeah. She is pretty good.
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
Do you want to come inside?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Look. That telegram was all scrambled. It was actually from Thompson, not to him. Western Union must have gotten the names reversed. I have to get going. I have to get out to the track.
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
Well, thank you.
Killed?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Not down in my parts.
Never mind. Let's get right to the heart of this thing. Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel...
No more of that talk or I'll put the leeches on you.
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
My heart!
And eat them! That bastard won't get away with this! What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism?
Not yet. I want to study its habits.
Do they pay you to screw that bear?
Probably the bartender. He wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.
He told me he was turning in early...
Room service sent it up. I wanted something to cut the limes.
It's straight economics. This girl is a god-send. Shit, she can make us a grand a day.
NO! Stop talking like that.
Us?
Maybe we should take it easy tonight.
This is a fucking nightmare.
Right. Sure as hell some dope-dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops.
Lucy is looking for you.
Relax. Let me handle this.  You'd make a piss-poor lawyer... Room 1600, please.  As your attorney, I advise you not to worry.  Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit.
Man, your head would swell up like a watermelon, you'd probably gain about a hundred pounds in two hours...
...then you'd notice about six huge hairy tits swelling up on your back...
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level.
We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help. The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it.
Why not? But for Christ's sake, just do it fast!
Part of what?
They'll get in! We'll all die!
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
We're lucky to be alive.
And the head?
Well, justice is funny.
This is it! This is our only way out! They have this place surrounded. We go out the front, we're dead. We go out the back, we're dead, but if we go UNDER them... we might just make it.  Now, who else is in? Seven can go.
Just move!
Look.
Oh yeah?
What?
But not flush against the tunnel?
Just cover me. It was built to move.
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
Will I go crazy or something?
It's much safer in there, sweety.
Well, where's the sonuvabitch!?
He's dead.
Two.
Covered.
Holds four.
Seven.
Oh? And what's that?
Gimme the keys.
Done. But you're locked in.  Will you hold the keys?
No shit.
You keep that key handy.
MOVE YOUR ASS!
Get something on that.
Ok. Let's see what happens.
Go!!!
Excuse me, sir?
I'm sorry, Frances. It's my job, you know?
You don't want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you don't want to show it --
Come here. I want to show you something.
Yes. That's the deal. She plays Lorna.
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
No?
No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
...Don't you?
An essay contest... a national contest. That's pretty impressive.
Be careful, Francie.
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
Daddy!
Good.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Will you be getting back together? When you quit Hollywood, I mean.
What is this?
Why, you... you little bastard!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
You looked okay.  Joint's pretty dead. How 'bout I take you home?
You're not the quiet type, Frances.
Came to get a tan.
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
I'm serious, Frances. This is important.
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
What for?
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
I guess.
No. To thoroughbreds.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
Well... I'll act like I do until I do.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
How did I look?
Why do you say that?
Yes.
Run!
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
You are a deeply troubled young lady... I only hope you change your course before it's too late.
Who're you?
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
...You will.
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Yes, Mama.
I'm going out!
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
I don't believe so.
Thanks are hardly necessary.
And what's that?
...Did you really say that?
Mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I'm pleased you're feeling more... capable, it's perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. Don't you agree?
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
No!
Yes. Very close
I am afraid.
Kill me and have done with it.
Kill you? Hardly that.
Then why am I here? What did you want with me?
I see it before me.
I'll be waiting. And watching.
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him.  I cannot do that alone.
Not as weak as I.
I'm all right. I'm safe,
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
I do. But you must trust me for now.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
Nothing in moderation, Clerval.
Good. I'll be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
Why Waldman? He of all people should have cheated death!
You've been going round-the-clock?
Nothing in moderation, Frankenstein.
I didn't find what I was looking for.
I owe you that. Done.
Let it go.
Philosophical?
I once saw it done, as a boy in Canton. My parents were missionaries. The cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I've never forgotten it. Been fascinated ever since.
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
It is a thrilling direction to explore. Thrilling and dangerous.  Nature can be wonderful and terrible. Science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. We must proceed cautiously. Assess as we go.  What I do on my own time is my own business. The same holds true for you. You wish to expand your mind? Fine, do so. You can even join me here, if you like. But not at the expense of your normal studies.
Why?
Are you a physician?
Then explain it, whatever it is. It could save the voyage. I've spent years planning this. My entire fortune.
You told her to sweep the courts.
You're right. It makes no sense.
I'll go take a look.
Marcie?
I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's. Today wiped me out.  Thanks, Alice.
No, they won't...
Let's go back, Barry...
I had to.
Want to see my trick shot? It's even better.
Sometimes I only think about kissing women.
I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake. Besides yourself.
Boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  Wait a minute, I'll get my diaphragm and be right with you.
Don't call him.
You? The brick?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Those things can be nasty.
I mean...
Why not?
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
You said it was just you and your son.
Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?
Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin' vampires. Psychos don't explode when sunlight hits 'em, I don't care how crazy they are.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Scott and Kate.
In heaven.
Auto wreck.
Yes.
I seem to have touched a nerve. Don't be so sensitive, Pops, let's keep this friendly. But you're right, enough with the getting to know you shit.  Now, there's two ways we can play this hand. One way is me and you go round an' round all fuckin' night. The other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down that first path at the end of the day, I'll win. But we go down the second, we'll both win. Now, I don't give a rat's ass about you or your fuckin' family. Y'all can live forever or die this second and I don't care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I'm wrong, but I take it you don't give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?
Yes.
You won't let him touch her?
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
To yours.
In other words, no.
You two ought to start a stand-up act, because you're just wasting your humor on me.
Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.
Mom's got nothing to say, she's dead.
Daddy's dead.
Later.
Knock yourself out.
Six-fifty.
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
All I'm saying --
Yes.
Duly noted. Now, shut up.
What does that mean?
Yes, you did. You said as long as I don't act like a fuckin' nut, implying that I've been acting like a fuckin' nut.
Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you're right, that was pretty fuckin' nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can fix that right now.
Yeah, I think so. What happened?
No problem, lieutenant.
I've been accused of that wish.
Uh... don't see it.  There's no signature.  But hang on -- there's a note to "See Addendum."  Checking...
Of course, but there's more --
If you were like everyone else, lieutenant, I suspect we wouldn't be making statements about not making statements, would we?  Take your leave.
No, sir, WHAT?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
Congress and the Pentagon share a lot of plumbing.  They'll never know whose leak it is.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point...
I know that, sir.  Ma'am.  It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly.
I've had it.  Just because they pay me like a baby-sitter doesn't mean I'm gonna be one.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
I'll try to keep the door open.  If you wash out, I make it so that --
Sounded lame as soon as it came out of my mouth.  But I'm trying to be honest, okay?  Three years is a long time.  Don't ask me to predict how I'll feel then, Jordan, because I don't know.  And either do you.
Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you.
I'm tired of fighting back.  I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
Yeah.  Me too.
You're kind of a surprise yourself.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
That's a good story.
Sure, sure.
McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s.
I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew --
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over.
Your new roommate.
Somebody throw a tent over this circus.
Sabotage born of economics? Wouldn't be a first.  But is Hayes really going to start his watch with such a public failure?
Possibly.  Just to spite DeHaven.
I take it this file is still open.
Where's Audrey?
Well, I can be tough if I want.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
But we can get to the west side faster.
No.
I didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.
Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
What do I get?
It's your choice.
We? I don't think so.
You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
Only five, Sir. We've checked them all. He hasn't used any of them.
That is our job.
Major, what do you think could have done this?
Get your people out of there or I will.
Yeah, you're the worm guy.
The radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's DNA! You have any idea what that means?
You're standing on it.
We're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
But you don't know for sure!
That's not true. Our worm guy, er, I mean, Dr. Tatopoulos found blood.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
We've met before.
Why do you need that?
555-7600. Tell them it's a code dragonfly. They should get you through.
Yes sir... The use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
I... I don't think I'm going to make it Sir...
No, don't talk like that, son. We're going to get you fixed up.
I won't and nothing you say-
Leadership....
THIS much.
KILL IT? Well I'm open to ideas!...
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You think you could do better "Laredo?"
I still haven't got this bloody thing off.
What?
There IS no quantum flux and there Is no auxiliary... There's no goddamn ship  Do you get it?
Oh... Oh, I see. Oh.
It's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. Many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
No,  I am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter REARRANGER, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Lt. Madison, GO.
Raise the glass and push the blue button.
Yeah. What's wrong? JASON ~~othIno. I -ust oncuont ot wou~o oc oomooooateo onan onat.
You worked with Hopkins? I worship Hopkins.
Sure, Guy, If you can stand the excitement.
No. Nobody does. Do you know WHY? Because my character Isn't IMPORTANT enough for a last name. Because I'm going to DIE five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
Let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
But I'm the Commander!
Gwen... Gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
Mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
Jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
Turn on the translation circuit.
Well forget it!  I'm not going.  This episode was badly written!
TOMMY, 270 DEGREE TURN TO PORT!
I don't know guys... I mean, he almost looked... sincere. I know, it's bizarre!
Then tell me one thing... What does it do, the device? The Omega 13.
I don't know.
Prepare a tear harness for the female...
Do you think I'm a fool? That the Commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
Then how did he find out about the device?
I'm sorry. You deserve to be shown.
But there it is!...
Hey I was doing okay with the pig lizard.
I'm trying Commander... Everything's a blur, but as long as I stay locked to that vox signal...
Patience, Lt. . Patience.
The core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
Over three hundred miles.
It is.
Well, truth be told?  I was a pharmacist.  Alexander?
Exactly.  We'd attack the baggage wagons and the rear guard.  It would cause the line to buckle. Then we hit the center with our main force and cut them in half.
Same old story.
As soon as the men have good shelters I'll move.  Perhaps Martha will join me this winter.
Yes, general.
Wil, I'm giving you your freedom. Do you understand?
More than that, sir... my orders from Congress.
It's a wonder they find the British cause worth dying for.
I am not conscious of it, sir!  But since you have thought it necessary to tell me so, we part!
Is this a coup?  Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
George, you're the only man the people trust... trust with power. They know you won't betray them.
The last I heard, a bunch of drunken militia have dug in on Breed's hill.  With one stroke the British could cut them off and apparently their leaders are too dumb to see it.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
What's the difference?
What can he do?  The British have massive superiority.
They are also very religious.  So, we will attack them three days from now, on Christmas.  One force under me, and another to the south under Colonel Cadwalader...
Understand?  You need to be listening to people like John Adams, and to keep the best interest of the country first in your mind!
Uh... none just now, but...
I... they look both the same.
Chose another.  Any general worth anything should have a brace of horses.
The eternal dream of the disenfranchised, my dear:  a classless world.  Not a very real expectation.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
I... I'm possessed of the idea of a command in your army, sir.
You wrong me, general; I am an officer and a horse-shoer.
You have a free tongue, Captain Hamilton.
You know, I came back to Mount Vernon to retire.  I don't need to be in government.
You know very well who it is that I love.
That's a lie!
Perhaps you've been counting my acres, Mrs. Fairfax, and discovered exactly how poor I really am.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it.  You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
Who says so?
Well, I hear 'The People'.  Indentured servants, freed slaves... escaped slaves.  The world's castaways.  And, my fear is, in the scramble for power that's coming, you will betray them.
Juba was a Numidian.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
What about him?
I hear he's around Palm Springs. Dealing our product. Product we sold to you for five hundred thousand dollars.  Why do you keep talking to me bullshit? I think maybe I have Ramon and Ceasar staple your tongue to your chin. What do you think?
I put a gun right here...  ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Yeah, well, we need a ride somewhere, we'll let you know.
First you and me gotta get a couple things straight.
Leo, I don't know.
What I'm sayin' is the man wants his money and he wants it now.
Are you the guy they called Ray Bones?
What three hundred grand?
Who?
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
Or else use your fucking imagination.
Ray. Look at me.
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
You have a card in here?
Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
That's half a movie, with holes in it. Maybe forty minutes of screen time. You don't even have a girl, a female lead, and on top of that, there's no one to sympathize with, you don't have a good guy.
The shylock's the good guy.
But you work for the casino?
Heart attack. Apparently they brought a couple hookers along.
I'm not gonna pop her, Harry.
What Get Away jet?
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
No, I don't. Though I have to say I'm curious.
So you want to know.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
You don't open an account, Leo, you put it in a safe deposit box. Dip in whenever you want.
Now you're down to three-ten in the case. You must've cooled off quite a bit since you got here.
I wouldn't let her if she tried. Why I'm here, Leo, basically, is to save your ass.
I'll find you, Leo...
But a week. That's a hundred and fifty percent a year.
I know I'm better than what I've been doing the last ten years, walking around in a tank top and fuck-me pumps, waiting till it's time to scream.
That why Harry came over last night? See if you could help him get Martin in his movie?
I just caught the end.
Why does anyone want to be in movies?
Yesterday, you were a loan shark.
Yeah. We understand you read the script and like it... a lot.
How 'bout Chili's Hollywood Adventure.
Oh.
What happened?
Continental, but it doesn't matter. Martin won't order from the menu.
I was scared then, not now. How long you want me to be scared?
Tomorrow, I see on the TV weather, it's gonna be nice and warm. You won't need the coat.
Hm?
He happens to be loaning me five hundred grand, no strings, I write any kind of agreement I want.
Once their lives are in danger and you have the mob guy coming after them, it not only heightens the tension, it adds a wistful element to their love.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Morning, skipper.
Looks like it took out the backup genny too.
Maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Maureen.
Maureen?
Or uninvited guests.
I tell you one thing, we're not gonna be towing no ship now.
A what?
Smugglers maybe.
Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
I know I know, two ways to do anything --
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours.
And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off?
What is it?
Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull!
Right.
I bet you did.
Too big. More like a freighter.
Cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
Probably didn't have time.
Because of the gold.
Headache, nausea, lights?
Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more.  What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways.
Only way to be.
You sure it wasn't me?
Dodge, get on that turbine. I don't care if you don't sleep for a week. The sooner you're done, the sooner we can get out of here. How's the food situation?
Greer?
I don't know. No. Not Greer. Somebody.
But where's the damage?
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
What happened.
It was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.
So you killed them?
Murphy, don't you see what's happening?
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
Guess I must've fallen back to sleep. Where's Epps?
Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million.
Let's just take it easy here, alright? Nobody's gonna kill anybody.
Would you hold on just a minute here, please? Look, there's no reason to panic now. Epps saw somebody. Fine. It's a big boat.  Chances're real good he doesn't even know about the gold. If we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  The gold stays where it is til we're ready to go. Like I said, it'll be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
Couldn't have happened much more than a month ago.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Or what?
You want fair pay, make hamburger for Mickey D. Otherwise, please to sign.
Give up?
YES.
Yup.
Yeah ... where is this? Bosnia?
We're almost done.  Hi. Yeah... no, it's excluded. They've already paid the earnest money... well, let them bring it up if they notice it at the final walk through. Right, great, sounds good!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
I see... interesting...
I'm not sure... I mean...  I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
Uh-oh.
...wow...
I...
Help me what?
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
It's not optional!
Look, I'll be done in a minute. Just wait outside.
Why?
"Yeah, right"... well why not?  What's so wrong with me?
Then why do you hate me so much?
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
Why do you have that stupid poster?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Did you sign up yet?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
Okay, well here's yours...  "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
Gross.
What is this?
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff.  There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
What are you talking about -- who?
We should follow him home.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
I know a party we could go to...
Where?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
But those are our people...
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
Get away from me!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
Go ahead...
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
You're insane.
What are you talking about? Who?
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid. 
I'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and I'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. I'm so excited to finally have some free time. We have to get together this summer!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I'm thinkin' maybe I could let it go...
Hey, where are you going?
What?
God, fuck you!
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Well there's a few choice LPs in here that re-issue some really great old blues stuff.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
You think it's healthy to obsessively collect things? You can't connect with other people so you fill your life with stuff...  I'm just like all the rest of these pathetic collector losers.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
I'm totally serious!
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Well, let's see... I guess I'd have to put Traditional Jazz, Blues, and Ragtime music at the top of the list, then probably...
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Oh... uh, thanks a lot Enid... I really appreciate it...
It's just my stupid back. I'll be all right in a minute...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
Why?
I won't even dignify that with a response.
Uh yeah. A long time ago... she called before once... it's just somebody trying to humiliate me.
How can you be so sure?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Just someone so young...
In what way do you mean?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Yeah, well... me neither...
Don't worry about it. He's not gettin' any and neither are you.
Right.
Call me sometime.
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Right, exactly!
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
Why would she be hiding from me?
I don't know... where is she, then?
Maybe she's with Josh?
Why? What did she tell you?
What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
Am I to take it you want to live?
Games?  Look at me closely, Patterson: I am a monster. My only pleasure is tormenting people who work for me, such as yourself.  One mistake and I promise you this: I'll make you hate me.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Don't they, though?
-what's the surprise in that, this is Africa?
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
-is it, I'm sorry, but then, of course, you're the doctor, you should know.
-well, it's just...  ...other men don't abandon their wives at such a time-
What if there are complications?-
All right- you'll spend your nights inside.  You'll have plenty of ammunition. You're totally protected, you have really nothing to fear.
I've never been all that adventurous. I wouldn't be in the way?
Nigel, you'll just have to use your hands- 
What did I do?
We need to talk.
You'd never force the lion to me- and nobody ever got a lion with one shot by luck.  Around there's a clearing- you'll know it from the anthills- get there and hide and listen to the sounds- I'll make the lion come directly to you. 
In point of fact it didn't- but I'm convinced the idea is sound.
You just got hit.  The getting up is up to you- but they're only lions-  -and I'm going after them crack of dawn... 
Nobody's seen anything like this. Lions don't have caves like this-  -they're doing it for pleasure.
Don't they have to be?...
Do you love her?
I have to ask- why do you need me?
You've known him long?
Four should do it.
And where will you sleep beautifully?
Okay, I'll take a raincheck on that.
No, everything's fine.  Honestly.  Thanks anyway.
Does he ever mention me?
Certainly.
I'm not a doorman, Miss Barrett.  I'm a building superintendent.
Okay, okay.  It's not my job, but what the hell.  I'll do you a favor.  He takes the grocery bags from her.
That's a good-looking kid you got there, Ms. Barrett.
Unusual?  I don't know.  I haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
Don't worry about me.  I'm like a cat.
Good-bye, Peter.
I'd like to stay, but I really don't have time to hang around here.  I'll call you.  Later, Johnny!
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I'm not even good for me.
Let me jingle you right now.
Valentine's Day.  That's got to be a bummer. Where did you get that date, Elaine?
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
No, you can't, and I think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. You may get some nice ones occasionally like Starman or E.T., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  Anyway, we're just about out of time.  Next week on 'World of the Psychic,' hairless pets.  Until then, this is Peter Venkman saying ...  ... Good night.
Janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
So these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
You're right.  We should stay.
You're very brave, Louis.  Good luck.
I know.
I'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  If she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  Hey, you!  Vigie!  Look at me.  I'm talking to you.  Hey!  Look at me when I'm talking to you.
Okay, let me rephrase that question.  Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
I let them handle all the little stuff.  I just come in on the big ones.
This year?  That's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  I mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  So you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  And it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. You would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
I had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but I'm going to tell you the truth. There are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  That's where we come in.
Hello, Venkman.
I think they're more interested in my epididymis.
Some crank.  Looking for goat hooves.  Come up with anything?
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
There's something very familiar about this painting.
If he wasn't dead he'd be an Olympic prospect.
'Mood slime.'  We ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
We're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  We thought you might want to come along.
Are you kidding?  We'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  I'm going to take 72nd straight up to Fifth.  Trust me, I used to drive a cab.
She's new in town.
No, I just thought --
It is a star!  That's great.  You're very good.
Okay.  I'll take a raincheck.  I always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  Listen, that reminds me, I'm having a party for all my clients.  It's gonna be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  I know you fill out your own tax return, but I'd like you to come being that you're my next door neighbor and all ...
Barrett.  Dana Barrett.
Some people like the attention.  Some people are just crazy.
It's in the stars.
No.  If I moved out now I'd be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I'm not ready to do that.
Well, let's check it out.
Out!
Don't scream.
"Gozer" -- he was very big in the Sumerian religion.  One of their gods.
All right.  Since you put it that way.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Okay, I'll help you.  Should we make some dip or something?
Right ... You're the Gatekeeper.  But I want Dana.  Dana, speak to me ...
I see.
He's a big one.  You don't want to mess with that particular breed.
That's very fascinating to me.  I read a lot myself.  Some people think I'm too intellectual.  But I think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  I also play racketball.  Do you ever play?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
Keep it anyway.  I have another one at home.
I have Ph.D's in psychology and parapsychology.
And how many ghosts have you caught, Mr. Venkman?
And where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
Have it your way, Mr. Venkman.
They're not guns.  They're particle throwers.
Yeah, yeah.  I just want to see 'em.
Wow!
Egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  Do you remember that?
What?
Does she want to be?
I don't think so.  It's more of that Gozer thing.  She says she's the Gatekeeper.  Does that make any sense to you?
I blame myself.
I need two new purge valves.  How's the grid around the storage facility holding up?
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
If anyone deserves it, it's Spengler and me. We're doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
Yeah, but I introduced you guys.  You never would've met if not for me.  That's got to be worth something.
You're always so worried about your reputation.  We don't need the University. Einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'They can't stop progress.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
Do you know when that might be?  We're on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Sit tight.  I'm on my way.
No!  Nobody ever built them like this!  The architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  The whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
Well, that ought to do it.
Oh, stay...  Don't you want to join the chorus of praises for Narcissus' glory?  Just remember, he is a married man.
And Caesar!  Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
I have to come back.  If I don't come back the people will think I'm a coward.  Tribuus, tomorrow he dies -- I want his blood on the sand.  Do you understand?
What are you talking about?
"... by the emperor of Rome.  This writer asks:  between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
Oh, but with the army behind you, you could become extremely political.  Not a Republican by any chance?
We have to stop the Germans now!
How can they?  Who else is there?  I have no heir...
I don't know...
I've read of it.
Yes!  The days of Imperial Prerogative and disdain for the Senate are over -- thanks to your father!  Now report to the Senate, Master Galen:  what is Marcus' state?
We all know what right is, Senator.
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
I've made so many mistakes, Narcissus.  We all put off the very last duties of our lives because we're afraid of admitting when our lives are over.
Much more colorful than the ones we wear.  And, of course, less dented.
Let's hope he doesn't start giving orders.
I killed too many barbarians.
Chain him.
I refuse to be your slave.  I refuse --
-- to fight?  We'll see...
Then, you'll die...  Just, know this:  because you asked I asked:  I'm sorry but...
Make us rich, Proximo, make us very rich...
Spend my days beheading country bumpkins?  I don't know, Proximo, who has better wine than you? Besides, I'm beginning to think of the Colosseum as my home.
Pressures on, eh Proximo?  There's got to be a load of money in this. Why else would you toss a red hot commodity like me out the window?
Are you going to graduate school?
I'd love some.
No -- why should I?
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Oh my God --
Ah. Where?
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
Oh.
But you're not enrolled.
I think it is.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
Don't you have it on?
Well -- where are you going?
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
Okay. Enough said. That's a deal.
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
I am going to call the police now.
Will you bring it in to me?
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
The Singleman party, sir?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
Sir?
No.
In general.
What?
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
Well I don't know.
All right. Now finish your drink.
Her portrait?
Very much.
Right.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Let me out!
Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
Yes.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
To tell you?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Either one will be fine.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
Are you afraid of me?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
You can admit that, can't you?
That you're afraid --
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Anything. Anything at all.
Neither.
You're not interested in art?
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
Him?
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Man, is this interesting.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
See if you can guess.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
What?
Why are you asking me all this?
I'm curious.
Don't start acting hurt.
But if it's sickening for you --
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
I just don't believe you would do that.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
Very good, sir.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Hey -- I don't get it.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
I do.
You believe me, don't you?
What about it?
To be what?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
What?
Yes, sir.
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
Can you look through the glass.
I don't believe it.
That what he says. Right?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Yes.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
I don't like your tone.
With the pearls --
What about the money?
I'll pay you back.
Yellow Room where they dance -- 
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Money.
Yes -- I'd love to.
I feel sorry for him.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
For tonight. 
Because you love me -- you love me?
So alone.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
And...?
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
What?
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I'll not denounce you.
I know.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Very early in the morning.
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
Goodnight, Kringelein. 
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
No, Doctor.
Telegrams?
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years.  I've been everything.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
I'm engaged for the evening.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock. 
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
I never danced before -- in public.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
Yes, of course, -- money!
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Moreover... 
What brown hands you have.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
Hello!
Nothing.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Shhh -- here he is now.
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
Next week.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
He likes to play the great man.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
Oh!
What -- what is it? Last night...
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
Again?
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
Go away -- go away.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Yes, I know them --
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself.  There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
You are late. Hurry.
Well -- gentlemen.
What's bluff?
You wanna talk to me straight up?
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
You got any kind of long coat in the car? Anything you can wear home over your clothes?
See your son, huh? Well, that's nice. A side of you I didn't know, Lilly.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
You're a thousand percent right!
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
We're not really interested, Henry.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you know where it was purchased?
Why, of course it is. I can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
Roy Dillon.
Lead on.
Well, uh... No.
Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you.  Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
Fair enough.
Only one tooth?
Don't mention it.
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
You don't have the stomach for it.
Well... nice to see you again, Lilly.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
I don't see why not.
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
Oh, that's it! You're stealing my money for my own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.
NO!
It isn't the owner, Myra, it's my wife. She knows what's going on. This time, I gotta have the money.
You taught me a lot. Then I invented.
I am in school.
Let's find out.
I just do what the doctor says, babe.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
I'll see you when you get home.
The long end. Big con.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
I thought these people were broke.
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Come on, Myra, don't talk business here. This is time out.
I don't think I need it.
For Christ's sake, why not?
No. I mean, I don't believe it. Lilly is not a suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
Gun?
Do you have any particular reason to say that?
You up to it now?
Well, I'm back now. I just wanted you to know. Gotta rush.
They said on the phone you were assigned to the Meyers case.
With all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in Illinois on Michael Meyers.
Well, when you put it that way.
Care to join me?
Come on, Carter.  You know it's Michael.
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
No shit.
You're so predictable.
I just went for a walk.  It's no big deal.
Just forget it...
Yes.
Keri.... Laurie... how about if I just call you Mom?
Are you crazy?  You'll get caught.
It's always John.
Bye Will.
Nope.  Hey, you think I'll win scariest costume?
Condom Boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
No!  I keep seeing him staring out his window. Watching me.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Kara and Danny never showed up tonight. We'd better go home and check on them. There's nothing else for us to do here.
Guess so ...
What if it's Kara?
Debra, you're fuckin' insane.
What makes you think he'll come here again?
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
It's not working!
But surely Rogers isn't --
Retiring.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
This is madness, Wynn.
Please -- just tell me the truth.  Has Michael Myers come home?
No!!!
It's a bitch.
Take the Cadillac and drive it off a cliff, for all I care.
Go home.
Let's talk about it some other time.
I'm lonesome already.
Let's talk about something else.
I guess.  You're lucky you don't have any old people around here.
He's a man.  Tell him you're a man.
All the more reason to go to Africa.
Tit for tat--as simple as that.
Maybe it's time you got out.
I know you think that.
Goodbye, Looseleaf.
Is Penelope in?
Pass the fucking catsup.
What?
Out!  Out!
He doesn't do it in front of me, but he does it with Mother.  You know what he called Father one time?
He was a stretcher-bearer in the Korean War.  Were you in a war with Father?
Oh hell.
As in "Death, where is thy sting?" He killed at least fifty men, wounded hundreds more.
The Germans shot everybody who lived there, then leveled it, plowed it, planted turnips and cabbages in the fertile ground. They wished revenge for the slaying of the Beast of Yugoslavia.  To their twisted way of thinking, your father had butchered an Eagle Scout.  Play lots of contact sports?
You're supposed to get hurt!
Does it bother you to have your mother engaged to a man like that?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
What time do you get off work, my child?
I couldn't help overhearing that you were about to get married again.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to.  Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately.  I hope he can.  I will take a little longer.  I'll be as quick as I can.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
I don't want that chancre mechanic in here.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
You and your damned bedside manner and your damned little black bag full of miracles.  You know who filled that bag for you?  Not Alice-sit-by-the-fires like yourself.  Men with guts filled it, by God--men with guts enough to pay the price for miracles--suffering, ingratitude, loneliness, death--
Ram it up your ass!
All right--bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler.  Oh, hell--sit down, Colonel. Penelope will bring you some chow.
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Which one?
What a honeymoon.
You're wrong.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Go on.
The doctor.
If he wants to go.
Two hundred years old.
He'll play with his rifle, I expect. That will cheer him up.
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
You hope this, too?
The National Safety Council would be appalled.
Of course he can go--if he'll just go down on his hands and knees for a moment--and promise me that he does not find me comical in the least degree.
Do it, Norbert.
You're--you're old friends of Harold Ryan?
Oh, oh, oh--I thought it was your apartment.  You seemed at home here.
And still Mrs. Harold Ryan?
Will you please go?  An emergency!
A policeman delivered the baby in a taxicab.
She's crying because she's so happy.
None.
You have chills?
Are you've seen it work cures?
A living fossil!  Like the cockroaches and the horseshoe crabs.
I love you!  Have a cigar!
You're not such a creature of the ooze that you'd hurt an unarmed man.
You hope.
You have a very good mind, or I wouldn't have come back.  That mind is now asking itself, cleverly and fairly, "Is Harold Ryan really a clown?" And the answer is, "Yes."
My violin is avenged!
No.
What are you going to do?
Leave the rifle here.
She did?
No, no--shit no.  Excuse me, Penelope.
For what?
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
How horrible.
Do I have to?  Who's the little girl?
Ach soooooooooo. MILDRED No grown woman is a fan of premature ejaculation.  Harold would come home trumpeting and roaring.  He would the kick the furniture with his boots, spit into corners and the fireplace.  He would make me presents of stuffed fish and helmets with holes in them. He would tell me that he had now earned the reward that only a woman could give him, and he'd tear off my clothes.  He would carry me into the bedroom, telling me to scream and kick my feet.  That was very important to him.  I did it.  I tried to be a good wife.  He told me to imagine a herd of stampeding water buffalo.  I couldn't do that, but I pretended I did.  It was all over--ten seconds after he'd said the word "buffalo." Then he'd zip up his pants, and go outside, and tell true war stories to the little kids.  Any little kids.
Ja?
Men can touch other men, and it doesn't mean a thing.  Haven't you ever seen football players after they've won the Superbowl?
I don't want to live any more.
The wife of Harold Ryan is going to marry a pansy next?  This is the end of Western Civilization as far as I'm concerned.  You must be crazy as a fruitcake.
No.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
Oh, Paul--
A fairy--a queer.  Everybody in the building knows he's a queer.
It's beautiful.
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!
It is an emergency, isn't it?
Okay.
I was captain of the wrestling team at Lehigh University.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
When Harold is definitely out of the picture, Penelope, when I don't have to worry about doing him wrong or you wrong or Paul wrong.  I'm going to ask you to be my wife.
I'm touched.
I see.
Is he all right?
Far as I know.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
A week.  We were waiting for the right time to--
I didn't make my move fast enough. That's it, isn't it?  I was too respectful.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
Throw out all this junk.  Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old.  Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
If you warned him against it as much as you say, it's almost a certainty.
No!  Oh no!  Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
I'm amazed.
It's really that bad?
I feel like I've been double- crossed.  If you'd just told me it was Harold's birthday--
If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I've been asking a lot of questions and I don't like the answers I'm getting. He's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
Yeah.
Well, I want to...
You're not Vice, are you?  Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Pull out your cock.
...about this woman.  I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
How many weeks?
Just one.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
I tried to get more, but this is the limit. The De Vries line has the same area.
Don't you think it's a little too... bright?
What's that shade of blue called?
Sam?
Yeah. How did you know?
No.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Yeah.
Um-hm. Live sound.
Tod might know.
If we went there, would you be able to find him?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
A friend.
Tod was.  He was with Ratan.
Is Kristen safe?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
No, please go on.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
But what?
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Well, what do they know?
...What do you have to offer?
Who's paying you?
Can you meet me in about an hour? At the Pantlind Hotel?
Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, Jake?
Do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
They're legal now.
Hmm.
What do you mean?
Do the police want to arrest me?
Just leave me alone.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
Yeah. She's quite upset. I'm going to fly out today. They want me to bring some pictures.
What plan?
I don't know no Ratan, but I may be able to help you out. It's not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What?
I wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
I thought I'd invest in a film. I want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
If you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It's a lot cheaper.
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
What do you think of that? Or this?
He didn't look good at all. Something strange is going on. He's got himself into some trouble. He wouldn't say what.
Granville's looking for you anyway.
Was he with a girl?
Thanks.
How do you do. I'm Mrs. Chasen. Come in.
Political Science. It's all about what's going on.
Oh, I don't have one.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Lady, resisting arrest is a serious criminal offense. Under the state criminal code, section 545, paragraph 10-B...
Lady, is it true you're driving without a license?
What kind of a car is it?
A rather free translation but nonetheless correct. Greetings to you too, my little one.  Tell me, what do you see?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
I don't know.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Yearse!
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
It's very interesting.
No.
Me! No. Of course not.
No. 
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette...  ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... <u>Snow!</u>
I don't know. Just one of those. 
What?
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Well, I really don't drink...
I don't know.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Did Confucius say that?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
With God?
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Yodeling?
Shall I drop by tomorrow?  Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
What is it, Harold?
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
I'll never forget you, Maude.  But I would like a photo of you.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Harold!
Perhaps it is.
Ohhh. What's hari-kari?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
What about the draft?
I go to funerals.
None at all?
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Yes.
Eh?
Well, I don't...
Oh yes. That's fine.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
Yes.
We've always been here.
I knew you'd come.
You a doctor, too?
Are you crazy?
I KNOW I don't have to. It's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. O.K.?
It's been Hell.
I've come for my father!
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
"Paranormal"  But -- you read the transmission.
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
That makes him more than a hundred --
I thought you liked being on TV.
A prison. The Vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the List of Avignon. Of which we hold a copy.
Impressive. Do you remember what it said?
This -- ? This is nothing. You know what'll kill me?  Her.
Okay. You saw the fish man, right?
His what??!!
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
What are you trying to say?
I wish I could be more gracious but --
Each of us gets a belt.
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Wait -- Wait -- You can't go anywhere -- I gotta go with you --
Myers?
C'mon, time to go home. Tape you up.
Could've fooled me. Go away.
That's right, Stud, hold me down.
"Need" is a good, solid word.
I like that...
Miss Sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
Cocky.
That you feel that way about me.
Yes, I --
Just take it slowly.
Many times.
HE did. I've seen him.
No. That wasn't the deal.
I have to speak to my father.
It's important.
No.
I used to tell myself that. Used to try and pretend I was dreaming all the pain. But why kid yourself? Some things have to be endured. Take it from me. And that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
I said: don't look.
Sure. Somewhere safe.  Safe. Christ! They tortured me here. In this room.
The Cenobites. The creatures the box set free.  Sometimes I think they're still here. Just behind the walls. Them and their hooks and their beasts. Just waiting to break out again. Except that I've got the box.
So where's the harm?
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
Where's Daddy?
What's the problem?
Just a thought --
Why not?
I'm here.
Can I get you anything?
Kirsty.
What are you talking about?
No personal details?
I'll come over and see you in the next few days. You can show me the mansion. O.K.?
Of course. Every day.
Take care, Dad.
Call me tomorrow.
You like?
Sure.
I love you, honey.
It's like she's waiting for something.
It isn't. I know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
I AM house-trained.
Are you alright ?
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have surprised you.
Will you GO, damn you?
'Bye.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
Say it.
It's not my car, now is it?  It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow.  Fucking great.
What are you snickering about?
Ehh.
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
How the fuck am I supposed to know that?  You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Ha.
Suck my ass.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
No, you can't.
Oh really.  Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
They always seemed what?  They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed.  They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums.  I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
No.  The Righteous Brothers.
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
Uh.  That's me.
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Haha.  Right.  It's no problem.  I love making tapes.
Fantastic but I'm a little busy right now.  Listen.  Do you want to come to dinner Saturday?  I'm having some friends over and I need a spare man. Are you a spare man?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like.  What the hell?
Okay.
Sure.  'Course.  Rob, look.  Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
You're a horrible person, Barry.  I mean it.
Who's that?
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck!  Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I should be so lucky.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
Not really.
I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.
What were the others?
What, what?
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
Is what better?  Better than what?
I don't know.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
Look, I gotta go.  I work too, you know.
It's me.
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Mmm hmm.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
Who the fuck's Pig?
No, no.  When are you going home?
Mmnn.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
Hi.
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
How?  How were we the same people?
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
Nothing.
Where?
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
Just local, of course.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
Everything go alright?
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
I'm sure it isn't.
Whiskey.
I'd better go.  I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
Eleven-hundred.  That's my lowest offer.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
We're not there yet, Justin.
Maybe he's hiding from something.
How old is Richard?
Uncle Joey's little girl.  Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
You're the expert.
Then you didn't know Richard later on.
Mother too.  Sad case it was.  The young lady just couldn't make it through labor.  Never even saw her son.
Grave robbers?
And you?
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
He was innocent.
You are being foolish.
You've been listening to rumors.
I go my way and you can write all you want about the big bad Mr. Taupin.
At least.
Just a little crazy.
I'd like you to try.
He is older than I.
Sometimes I think it's just for something to do.  A conquest to be the last.  Something to hold onto while everything else around you withers and blows away.  Some- thing to replace the love that can never work.
I'll destroy you.  I've destroyed everything I've ever touched!  Oh God...
Not power.  Not control.
Call your mother.  You never call her.
What's all of this got to do with me?
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
I liked the bit you did about Baltic chastity belts. Too bad no one else did.
-Et lux perpetua-
Please go to no trouble.
How can you know this?
Why are you here?
In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
You are the same?
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Yes.  Always.
Does it change with me in the room?
Not even a single lifetime.
Aye.
It is always less with my living. Far or near.  But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before.  There is power in this.  And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
We are brothers.  And you are a defense-  -of sorts.
Point conceeded, Mr. MacLeod.
Not likely.
You seem to understand a great deal.
Then it is time two of us did. You are very young.  I was once young.  I can help.
It can be different.  It must be.
Don't threaten me, Private.
No.  I want this to be all ours.
He got him.  He always does.  Eventually.
He knows I'm here.  How?
Offered the Pope one of his whores.
I've had a few more concerns.
Leave her out of this.
Yes.
I was walking by when I heard a shout.  Your men came right after.
No.
For the moment.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Hello, Bensinger.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Au revoir, mon capitaine.
Did you finish the interview?
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
Did you give her the money?
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Oh.
No. My mother.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property.  Is that your desk?
Out of the mouths of babes.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
I haven't any hard feelings.
You bet I've got a better offer.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Listen, Walter --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
Dead?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Thank you.
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Where's some paper?
I'm finished.
Was she? Did you notice?
Come here. See if we can move it.
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
Don't tell me you were worried!
I don't know what to do, Walter.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
What would you do if it was a daughter?
You're not fooling anybody.
What's that -- what's that?
I'm busy, Duffy.
Hildy -- I can't. I'm busy -- I -- Let me up, Hildy. Earl Williams has escaped --
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
Point the gun at me!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
What have you got, Hildy?
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Good coffee, isn't it?
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too.  'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Hold her, boys!
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
Not this gun!
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
What is it?
Now, Hildy --
Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out.
Was I? The driver got knocked cold.
I'll go right after it.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Don't you mother me! Playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! Keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
They're not human!
Quiet, Mollie!
Shut up, you!
I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor.
What's from the Governor?
Who do you think!
The what?
Yes, yes!
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Hello, Mollie.
Say, Hildy...
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
I concede I was insistent, but how the Devil...
Looking for shrapnel.
I don't mind.
Bugger off.
They'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. Then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
We thought it was poison.
Pauline.
They've got the real thing outside.
I'm starting my own collection.
They might be.
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
...two Indians to fan me all night. The heat.
You joined up.
I wasn't too old when I started the course. I was too old when it finished.
What are you going to be then?
A clerk. I'm doing a typing course. I'll be typing for England.
Where to?
Who said anything about love?
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Up to six weeks, I think.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking.  And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
I wish it could all have been different.
Father, that's enough now
And now we're glad you did.
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
Really, that's a long time.
What about R.J.?
Oh, he was already gone before I seen him... but Tiny saw him and said he said he was going out to the yard to get a new wheel.
Go tell him to get your Grandpa.
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
You sure do a lot of guessing.
Ain't the only thing tasty in this house. 
Wondering what?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
Fucking great.
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Yeah, my Pa wasn't right in the head after that.
You mean John Wayne?
Yeah, I was never that big of a western fan. I like science fiction.
If we're talking cute... like regular cute, I'd say Leslie Van Houton, but cute ain't hot.
Hot has got nothing to do with it.
How much further?
Way out here?
No... yeah, they ripped him to pieces while his family watched from the car. The wife is screaming, the kids are crying. Some dude in another car filmed the whole thing.
Here he comes.
Let's get going before that thing tries to eat the car or something.
Screw that, no way, I ain't letting you go by yourself.
Don't worry, I'll be quick. Just stay here, no sense everybody getting drenched.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
Yeah, I guess, you know next to wacking his weasel his other favorite thing is twisting sharpened pencils in the corner of his eyes.
Had to take him to the hospital. Kid had Dr. Zaius stuck half way up his butt, couldn't get it out.
No, none. I had one once, back in '57 maybe... I don't know. Really ain't nobody we wanna be jaw flapping at around here no more.
Oh.
Yeah, in this book there's a chapter called Self Made Freaks about how people would mutilate themselves in order to work in a freak show. It mostly talks about tattooed people and wild men of Borneo and shit like that, but there is one mention of a single case where a woman was suspected of having her arms removed on purpose to become an arm-less wonder.
Why?
Shhhhhh.
Think, think. Try to open the lid, try to kick a hole in the wood.
No, nothing like that... yeah, we're gonna be a little late. We stopped for gas at this place called Capt. Spaulding's outside of Ruggsville and it turned into a whole thing, so we're kind of behind schedule.
You got to be fucking joking.
That's the understatement of the year.
I don't doubt that.
Oh, you mean on TV.
I think we should go straight. I mean we know for a fact there ain't nothing back that way, right?
What!
I um... no, I don't think so...
What! God damn, how many?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Go down stairs and play nice... I'm a gonna go 'round back and handle things like I always fucking do.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
I guess not.
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
Oui.
Oui. Perfect!
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you.  Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
I should turn them off.  Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
That would be good.
Hmmmph.
Stop. Get away.
What is it?
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
What for?
Anyway. Come already to the point.
That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?!
Hunh.
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
It's okay, Puff.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
That's what I'm counting on.
You still in the market for a real boy?
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
My brother is discreet.
Yeah, well my brother is his shrink.
Yeah?
Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Let's get you out of here. Come stay with me until you get your strength back.  Free electrolysis, if you want it! We'll get that face of yours cleared up in no time.
Shut up, you.
Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
Yes, and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
I'm sorry about my parents.
Do you?
Of course.  I simply love the... naturalness of it all.
Why certainly!
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality.
Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right.
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
It would just be helpful to know.
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable.  At the time though I thought it might help.
That was wonderful!
Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you?
Eat shit, thumbtack dick!  Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Oook. Oook.
Pittsburgh?
Hey, he's right!  Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
Next game, ten bucks.
For whom and for what?
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
You ever played billiards before?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
I lost twenty bucks.
You being cute?
So I got talent. So what beat me?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Well, I win sometimes.
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
I said we're leavin'.
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Fifty per cent?
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
You well-heeled, partner?
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
Comes right in this poolroom every night, eight o'clock on the nose. Just stay where you are. He'll find you.
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
I don't want it.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Give me a drink, will ya?
I asked around.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
So am I... Sit down.  Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Yeah. Just like that.
And I you.  I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
Half and a dollar.
I guess it's just you and me, huh?
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
You don't look like a college girl.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I drink.
No.
Oh, I forgot.
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
You got it all in your head?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
What's this supposed to mean?
Me. It's Eddie.
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
Is he a winner?
For how long?
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
Is that a fact?
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk...  Sausage! Rack 'em up!
Game's over, Eddie.
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
Let's go.
Yes.
Humans.
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
Stay alive.
If we want it, it is.
Let's check it out, Dad.
Let's see what's on the other side. Maybe we'll find some copper.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
What did it look like?
I'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
I left it at work.
Yes -- but ...
Mr. Gardner, I --
Why not?  Moving is hard for anybody.  Was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
This shows how to get to my home. I'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
All their lines were busy.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Connie, don't hang up.
I can't leave. We have to tell this to the President.
He's a good man.
That signal. It's a countdown.
You still got the Olds?
You can do that?
You punched the President in the face?
This I can see.
A cold? Of course.
Oh shit, we're late.
Roger, Eagle One, our primary target has shifted course.
It's doing what?
He's doing a good job.
Really? You don't mind?
Didn't want to say anything. I voted for the other guy.
Don't worry, big guy. I'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
Yeah. What would you think if we went there to live for a while?
It's the wrong field, you idiot! Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
Air... water... your "sun."
Peace? No peace.
Die.
Oh, he's in Austria. A slight detour.
And I am his.
Yes. My treat.
What is it?
It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Schneider?
Tapestries?
Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
My engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of Ankara while excavating for copper.  Can you translate the inscription?
Are you sure?
Pretty sure.
What?
It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
Out!
Look, can we discuss this later?
Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
Umh?
Feels like a cigarette lighter.
Don't get sentimental now Dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
What?
What final challenge?
What about Marcus?
Well, I'm as human as the next man.
You left just when you were becoming interesting.
Then what are you complaining about?  Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
It happens to me all the time.
"J".
Ready.
After you, Junior.
I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
No.
I'm sure that will please the Maharajah, Captain.
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
I'm afraid they'll kill them! We saw horrible things down there -- they had a human sacrifice and they ripped a man's heart out!
When they lost this rock their fields and animals died. They also said their children were taken from them.
Next time I'll cut off more than his finger.
Okay, Shorty.
You don't like him do you?
Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy! Then he talk in this real scary voice!
Yeah, that's what happened...
"Follow in the footsteps of Shiva. Do not betray his truth."
Why they glow like that?
Read you loud and clear, Indy!
They dig for the gems to support our cause. They also search for the last two stones. Soon we will have all five Sankara Stones and the Thuggees will be all powerful!
It's a sacred stone in a shine that's supposed to protect a village.
Somehow I feel safer in here.
I know the feeling...
You mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?
Wearing your jewels to bed, princess?
Don't catch cold.
No... the heart's still beating!
You're gonna get killed chasing after your damn fortune and glory!
You've got to go to sleep now.
Don't do that.
Who?
What street?! We're walking down QUEER STREET. We coming to Dopey Drive. We're about to be put somewhere quiet where they won't mind that we talk to ourselves.
...I need to make a phone call.
Where are we now?
I'm working on it. Soon as I find the right nerve bundle.
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
It's my head, I'll be the judge of that. Anyway, who are you?
No.
What for?
Hear voices don't I.
If I get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
Whatever you do, just...don't stop.
Why? AL  You know too much.
You have no choice, you're involved. Will you help?
Why?
I'd be helpless and useless. They don't have the PEM. Without that...there's no chance.
Door's locked.
Corridor A.
Where are we going?
That's not a good idea.
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
I can't do that.
It's illegal.
You are in trouble. Now do it.
You leave my glands alone!
...Just beautiful.
The sky, the sun, the sea... There's no one here. It's deserted. What now?
You eat it. You know what this stuff tastes like?
I'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. Just eat it.
Eat it?
Why not?
How should I know?
Well you did it today.
What glasses.
Just hold them close and stay still.
How do you know?
I'll be right here. I'll keep it in mind. I'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
You shut down your sensors.
I mean it. You watch old tapes of the ballgame, I'll fill you in... later. I mean it.
Better. I found Ryuji.
Where are you going?
Down to your heart. I'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
What do I do?
Relax. Let me do this.
One of your instincts?
You have to! Quickly!
Trying to analyze this stuff. Now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
Never mind, just say it.
You said 100,000 yen for the right Sony Walkman.
And Dieter?
He must not know. GRUNER just made the switch back.
I can't handle that thing.
Now, you're too suspicious.
She's in love with you. Anyone can see that.
RYUJI Bandaio. Grown near here.
Good.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
What a nerve!
I'll prove it. We'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our POD, bring it down, and then...inject him.
Doesn't matter. Then put him away.
We met on the beach.
I think I've heard of you.
What things?
When you do...
Here?
Oh yeah, thanks...
Of course you're not. We'll take good care of you.
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Couldn't help it. No offense. She's not your wife is she...?
Thanks, I appreciate that.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
Blake?
The poet...something he said...
Yes?
Let you leave without it.
Without what?
What way?
Yes, of course.
You are.
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
That was then. This is now. Who am I talking to?
No one. No one at all. I'm unemployed. Who do you?
Hires you for what?
You work for Ryuji?
Sometimes. I told you I did.
Why?
What is it?
Oh sure.
We figure out if it's in here.
Why don't you get us some food. This may take some time.
Now what?
Why?
You can say that again. What do we do?
What?
Escape.
Her?
Now what?
I have a seat. I've had it since nine.
...Mr. Athol will be with you as soon as possible. Will you be able to wait?
Thanks.
The experiment. The danger...
Could I have it, please.
Ms. Laufer gave me a star today.
Pooh's dusty, sweetheart... he's dusty, and you breathed him in, okay? So what's -- what's happening to you now is... cells called mast cells told your lungs "don't breathe any more of that dust in."  ...and the airways in your lungs are like branches. And when the branches close up, you get an asthmatic attack. And, we give you medicine, and you get better. Huh? Okay? You're better already, aren't you?
Did you see somebody or did you hear them?
I heard them.
Lowell?
We gotta hook up.
What? Forget it.
Okay.
Oh, I love that stuff.
Yeah, they argued he was going to reveal the secret formula of "Kools" to the world.  "Sealed" doesn't hurt Scruggs' litigation, and since we're the only ones with the story, I believe we're sitting on an exclusive.
It's not a rumor. It's a sale.  If Tisch can unload CBS for $81 a share to Westinghouse and then is suddenly threatened with a multibillion-dollar lawsuit from Brown & Williamson, that could screw up the sale, could it not?
You're exaggerating!
No. I'm not going to take "no" for an answer. No.
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
Hey! I'm not going to fire you, okay? Take a vacation. Now!
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
Yes, sir. What caliber is your gun?
We have a search warrant, Mr. Wigand. There's been a death threat.
...my files! Personal correspondence...
No, no, we're fine...
And, I'm told there are questions as to our "star witness'" veracity.
Catch you later.
Okay.  Lowell?
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Did I tell you you were wrong?
Is there any more rice...?
Try the car.
I didn't want to leave it there...
I got fired this morning... Where else am I gonna take it?
Where should I wash them?
That's for food.
Who's calling?
"60 Minutes," the television show?
Hello? Yeah...
I got perspective.
You're not even on this anymore... What do you care?
Well, would you want him to call you? Or, you want to call him? How do you want to do it?
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
No shit.
What's this?
Oh, torture? Great ratings.
Who are these people?
Give me a break!
Yeah... Thank you.
Good. I want to talk to you.
So, you didn't mention my name? You haven't talked to anybody about me?
...okay.
Well, my father left us when I was five-years old. He was not the most ingenious man I ever knew... Let's get back to Brown & Williamson. If you decide to go on "60 Minutes," I got to know everything about why you got fired.
You should. Because when you're done, a judgment is going to go down in the court of public opinion, my friend. And that's the power you have.
You believe that?
What?!
ABC Telemarketing Company.
You try and have a good time.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Hello, can you hear me now?
You called me.
Then hold it off the air until you got that. But I want to go to New York. And I want to go on the record. Right now!
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
Most certainly.
And on March 24, Thomas Sandefur, CEO of Brown & Williamson had you fired. And the reason he gave you?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Seven...
"Research..."  You declare, as a badge of honor, you don't even know what makes water boil...
I appreciate all that, Jeff. But, upon reflection... we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you.
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but...  I like my women with two boobs.
Triple!
We rest, Your Honor.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
What the hell is Botox?
It's your move, Miles.
What do you mean, was.
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
I'll be right back.
Did you see the tape?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
You don't believe in it.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
Okay Miles.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
She never particularly cared for me.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Fabric and fringe.
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
Meaning my house.
Marylin?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Jesus.
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
Do you know him?
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
My client has ruled that out.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
Marylin was friends with Howard and Amanda Doyle. They don't like the way you operate. They helped her.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Thank you.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
She owes me a meal.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Come in. Sit down.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
What ten thousand?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
Oh, no—no.
I'm sorry you read it.
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back. 
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Phone for help?  We're right in the middle of nowhere. There isn't a town within ten miles of here.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
That's right. You didn't.
You're on a budget from now on.
Yeah. Come on—we're stopping here for the night.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Like what?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Well, you were!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
You weren't so bad yourself.
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
You always want to run everything.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
Well, take them off.
What!
Oh, Peter— 
Nothing.  Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
We don't need forty cars.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
Why not?
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Maybe.  Sure—sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd—  Yeah, but where you going to find her—somebody that's real—somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Same to you.
You bet we did.
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging. 
Yeah? What makes you think so! He took his suitcase and everything.  Kinda surprised, huh? It's just like I told you, Zeke. They ain't married a'tall . . .
Eight o'clock.
The dame's too smart for him.
Throw it in the basket.  What's it say?  "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Yes.
Huh?
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Thanks, Joe.
Yeah.
What do you reckon that's for?
Who?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Oh, gee, Mister—you wouldn't—you ain't thinkin' about—
If you don't—Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Without them, it's going to be near impossible, chief, to prove Shaw's connection to the CIA.  We got the same problem with the governors. All of them.  Reagan in California won't give us Brading, Ohio refuses Orville Townsend, Texas on Arcacha, and Nebraska on Sandra Moffet.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
Street cats?
Then how the hell did you get in the Warren Commission, Dean?  Except through the phone records in the Dallas jail?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
A bullshit President!  I don't see any weeping for all the thousands of Cubans that bastard condemned to death and torture at the Bay of Pigs. Where are all the tears for the Russians and Hungarians and Chinese living like slaves in prison camps run by Kennedy's communist buddies - All these damned peace treaties! I'm telling ya Jack, that's what happens when you let the niggers vote.  They get together with the Jews and the Catholics and elect an Irish bleeding heart.
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance.  Three years later and he's still classified?  They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald.  Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17.  He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate.  He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick.  He stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
And therefore because Oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief.  That's what you're saying!
He had his palm print on the weapon.
I don't know, Bill, I just don't know.
So for those reasons, you're going to trial against Clay Shaw, chief? Well, you're gonna lose!  We should be investigating all our Mafia leads here in New Orleans - Carlos Marcello, Santos Trafficante - I can buy that a hell of a lot easier than the Government.  Ruby's all Mob, knows Oswald, sets him up.  Hoffa - Trafficante - Marcello, they hire some guns and they do Kennedy and maybe the Government doesn't want to open up a whole can o'worms there because it used the Mob to get to Castro.  Y'know, Castro being assassinated sounds pretty wild to John Q.  Citizen.  So they close the book on J.F.K.  It makes sense to me.
Maybe 'cause there's some rogue element in the Government!
...ever called Dean Andrews?
No, I did not.
What did they...
I don't know who to trust anymore. Yeah, sure I could use a pot of hot coffee and a few packs of Camels. You got anything new in the investigation?
But you are aware, he served in your Civil Air Patrol unit when he was a teenager.
We went straight to Houston, and then Saturday night we drove to Galveston and stayed over there.
I believe the boys got a couple.
Your young friends also told us you had no weapons in the car.  Dave, isn't it a bit difficult to hunt for geese without a shotgun?
Why?  What's wrong?
You think I was a getaway pilot for the assassination, don't you?
I was told that the family wanted examination of the head.
As a pathologist it was your obligation to explore all possible causes of death, was it not?
But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
I call'em as I see'em, Jim.  I'm ruling it inadmissible.
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
That's impossible.  You heard echoes ...echoes.  We have three bullets and three shots which came from the Book Depository and that's all we're willing to say.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Dammit, it doesn't add up!  Ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations!  The State Department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to Minks to insure Oswald's return.  Only intelligence people can come and go like that.
Presumably so he can now exercise his intellect stacking school texts at $1.25 an hour.
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold.  What are you doing in here?
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
Liz, do I have to spell it out for you?  Lee Oswald was no ordinary soldier.  That was no accident he was in Russia.  He was probably in military intelligence.  That's why he was trained in Russian.
Look, I'll rush and be there by two, I promise.  Go ahead without me.
It's going to get worse, honey.
A man just called.  He asked her everything!
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
Is it such a chore?  I don't understand you.
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison.  I'm not making any threats.  I'm leaving you.  I'm taking the kids to my mother's.  I am - I am.
Boss, the President's been shot.  In Dallas.  Five minutes ago.
We need to find more witnesses, Lou.
Graveyard dead near Big Sandy, Texas in '65.  Two in the morning on some highway.  A hit and run.
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
It was a Texas Live Oak, boss.  It sheds it's leaves the first week of March.  You try to hit a moving target at 88 yards through heavy foliage with this cheap 13-dollar sucker, the world's worst shoulder weapon.  No way.  The FBI tried two sets of tests and not one of their sharpshooters could match Oswald's performance.  Not one.  And Oswald was at best a medium shot.  The scope was defective on it, too.  I mean this is the whole essence of the case to me.  The guy couldn't do the shooting.  Nobody could.  And they sold this lemon to the American public.
The Warren Commission call him?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Well, if that's what you want to call it.  I didn't ever think it would come to this.  I guess I am, boss.
If I were investigatin', I'd round up the 100 best riflemen in the world and find out which ones were in Dallas that day.  You been duck hunting?  I think Oswald was a good old-fashioned decoy.  What'd he say?  "I'm just a patsy."  Out of the mouth of babes y'ask me.
Honey, another one of these.  This one's as weak as cricket pee-pee. Yessir, you mark my words, Jim, Vietnam's gonna cost Johnson '68 and it's gonna put that other varmint Nixon in - then watch your hide, 'cause there ain't no offramps on a freeway to Hell!
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Some people would say you're paranoid.
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA.  Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
...some story... the whole thing. It's like it never happened.
Never touched me.
Well, I guess now that Guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer.  I wasn't really part of the operation, you know.  I was handling the private-eye work for Guy when that came in - not much did - but that's why I was there... it was a nuthouse.  There were all these Cubans coming and going.  They all looked alike to me.
Banister was running his camp north of Lake Pontchartrain.  Ferrie handled a lot of the training.  There was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in Cuba.  A few Americans got trained, too.  Nazi types. Mercenaries.  But Ferrie was the craziest.
And Oswald?
Hold on, Jack.  What's the problem?
It's a means to an end.  This war has two fronts - in the court of law, we hope, against the odds, to nail Clay Shaw on a conspiracy charge. In the court of public opinion, it could take another 25 or 30 years for the truth to come out, but at least we're going to strike the first blow.
Germany.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
Virginia, you're a lucky little girl. Your daddy has entered you in a beauty contest.  Would you like to be in a beauty contest?
That sounds fun.
Do you walk home?
What are they?
Well, the public attention it would attract.  And we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, Mr. Ruby.
I went. I did. I took my mother and little brother.
I understand.
Naw, man. They just tryin' to put a fright in your ass.
Three years.
That's not what they're tellin' me.
Why the fuck you at home? Cause I spent ten thousand dollars gittin' your ass home.  Look, I gotta problem. I need help, and you can help me.
I'm gonna sell the other two tonight. This group of Koreans in Koreatown have started a Neighborhood Watch kinda thing. And they want a few weapons so the neighborhood niggas know they mean business. So I'm gonna sell 'em my two machine guns tonight. Only problem, I ain't never dealt with these Koreans before. Now I ain't worried. Asians are by and large real dependable. They don't want no trouble. You might argue about price, but you ain't gotta worry about them shootin' you in the back. But I got me kind of a rule. Never do business with nobody you ain't never done business with before without backup. That's why I need you, backup.
You think I wanted to spend ten thousand dollars on your ass?
But the only way to help you was to do that, so I did it.  Okay, how 'bout this? After we're through fuckin' with these Koreans, I take you to Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles. My treat.
Every step of this goes in my report.  I am now taking a manila envelope from the subject's flight bag.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Thanks.
I am, as a matter of fact.
Sure.
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
'Cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. He doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. He uses you to get a line on Ordell, make a case, then take him federal. You know what Ordell's into?
He's got that kinda money?
Cash poor?
If you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
I am. Have a seat.
Sure.
Who is this?
'74, I think.
Are you?
He called you?
What?... What'd you do?
Why?
Right around here, in the food court.
I don't follow your logic. What does his being nice to you have to do with him wanting Ordell's money?
What do you do when he comes home?
That's my job.
Did you do it that night?
Which one?
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
You know, a good cop won't let you know he knows you're fulla shit.
In a dress.
On the phone I told him I have the ten thousand he put up for your bond. I could bring the money and the papers for him to sign. Walk out and call the Sheriff's department.
What if he hears something he's not supposed to?
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
Who's side are you on?
Do you live together?
It isn't enough for Trafficking, but how 'bout Posession with the Intent to Distribute?
Then how do you know he sells guns?
What are you doing?
I thought you were going to let this one through.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
You talk to him?
His full name is Louis Gara. He just got out from serving four years in Susanville.
Yeah, well, it's not a point of view that A.T.F. shares. Once we make it evidence, it belongs to us. You are now officially out of trouble. Don't do nothing stupid, now.
You took the time to pay the saleswoman.
Not in the fitting room.
What about me?
Dreaming.
Hi, Melanie.
It looks good on you.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I don't know. One of your friends.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
I'm impressed. He knows a lot.
Sure.
Four years?
C'mon, don't lie.
I went to a few just to meet women. But I don't like to dance, and it's so fuckin; loud. During that whole scene I just drank in bars.  Who didn't make the cut?
You been to Japan?
I lived there for about nine months.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
Uh-huh?
...and just take it from him.
Gimme that bag before I knock you out and take it.
Then what?
Guess where I am?
Naw, man. I just told you, I'm comfortable. I ain't about to walk into that roach motel and get uncomfortable. You bring your ass out here.
Who was Beaumont?
What did he do?
So we on the same page then?
She one of the women I got set up. I got Melanie in Hermosa Beach. I rent Simone a small house in Compton, and about four blocks away I got me this nineteen-year-old country girl named Sheronda. I found her waitin' for a bus two days outta Alabama, barefoot, country as a chicken coop. Took her to my house in Compton, told her it was Hollywood.
Did you get it?
Twice. In the parking lot.
How much it there?
We went to the parking lot.
You sure she ain't somewhere with a half-a-million dollars I worked my ass off to earn?
Max Cherry.
Do Max Cherry and Jackie Brown know each other?
I'm going to Del Amo, see a movie, get something to eat.
I think I do. Is that good enough?
Gonna have to put up cash.
I know that.
Possession of unregistered machine guns.
Man, he won't like that. Beaumont don't got a doin' time disposition.
Beaumont ain't going nowhere.  Where do I sign?
I was wondering. What if before the court date gets here, Beaumont gets hit by a bus or something and dies.  I get my money back, don't I?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
I got some more business for ya.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first.
What?
Brown, Jackie Brown.
Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears?
You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement --
They decided to no-file. Tell me where you are and I'll bring you your money.
You keep fuckin' with me, you're gonna be asleep forever.
Lift up your pant leg. You help her?
And you did that to protect my interest?
My office.
She was afraid.
I'm telling you, you got her spooked. She won't leave there till you have your money and you're gone.
Uh-huh.
I call your office, she better answer the phone.
I know where to turn.
Yes.
You better be, motherfucker.
You know it's for you.
It's Beaumont.
We been shoppin'. Can't have my boy running around lookin' like a bum on the street.
No, thanks.
What do you want?
How do you know?
Daddy. Let go.
Just my luck.
What the hell? What kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
Used you?
She said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
Right. She doesn't stop talking about you. You're always on her mind. That's love, Jake.
The postal service. I'm a mailman.
Oh, you'd be surprised. They just don't have their doctorates, that's all.
No.  I see them.
See them?  What do you mean? Physically?
Yes.
But I see them.
It's freezing.
I'm not cold.
No. Of course you're not. You've just hurt your back. That's all. You're going to be fine. It'll just take some time.
Save me!
No. Don't move me.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
I didn't want to wake you.
Thanks.
Oh God, Jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
And where do you think Jezebel comes from?
Here. Look. This is me and Sarah when I was still at City College.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
'Cause she's always on your mind.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
They're like demons, Jez.
They weren't human!
Hey, I'm here.
It's gone to the top.
What are you talking about? I'm freezing.
You know what? I feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight.  Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
A chemist. Part of a chemical warfare unit out of Saigon. He said he knows me and that I'll know him when I see him.
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Oh yeah?  Try leavin' without me.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Hold me, Jezzie. Hold me.
That doesn't mean shit. Where do you come from, huh? And I don't mean Indiana.
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
I'm not upset.
Don't be funny.
Sit down, Jake.
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
I don't get it. Who are you? Why have you been following me?
The Ladder?
Because I can get rid of the demons. I can block the Ladder. I have an antidote. We can kill them off, chemically speaking. They'll all disappear. It's chemistry, my friend. I know. I created it. Come with me. I can help.
I'd hoped I'd never have to. Just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
For what? For seeking the truth?
He'll never make it.
Call my chiropractor.
Paul Gruneger! Well I'll be goddamned!
I just need to talk.
You can't talk in Brownsville?
That black car?
They've been followin' me. They're comin' outta the walls. I don't trust anyone. I'm not even sure I trust you. But I gotta talk to someone. I'm gonna fly outta my fuckin' mind.
Is he all right?
On top of him?
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Oh, come on!
What do you mean, not enough time?
What?
Explosive. We're blowing the walkway.
Get out of here!
Thorgan, pull us in.
He....He...
Where'd you get the gun?
I think I broke my arm.
This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program?
I don't know!
Suit up.
That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
You got that right.
Roger that.  Time to kick some ass!
Fuckin A...
Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something?
Not so bad.
You?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre?
Again?! Jesus!
Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
NO!
We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told!
So what else is new?
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
Barbie from hell...
Yeah 3cpo, I saw STAR WARS, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, Barbie...
Good point.
Yes, I've reprogrammed you. You are very brave. Bad ass.
A real mamma's boy that one. Dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. Little good it did him.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Keep trying!
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Are you finished?
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
I didn't say he was alive.
Scientists. Very intellegent men.
You're crazy!
My boat's neat, dad!
Do me this favor just once. Use the ponds.
I know who he is...
Unbuckle me -- fast!  Grab the leader. He ain't normal, this one... they never --
You hired me, remember? It's my $10,000. It's my shark...
No! No! No!  Swing around! After him!
Do you see the kids?
I don't want to depend on these things, y'know -– sometimes you can weaken your eyes.
Excuse me, but what are you talking about? Didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? It was on the Cape station news.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Rogue?
And before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?
What stinks so bad?
Half a flounder. Hmmm... a burlap bag... a paint can... aha!
A 4th of July beach is like ringing a dinner bell, for Chrissake!
I wish it would rain...
You were on the Indianapolis? In '45? Jesus...
Wednesday... No, it's Tuesday, I think.
A thousand apiece, something like that. There's five of us. And we each kick in a hundred a week for beer and cleaning, stuff like that.
What else could've done that?
Twenty years.
You love sharks?
I do.  But you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.
Is that a boat?
I've got all these signs here...
Let me see your hands...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
Hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. Nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...
Power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. If I can hit him. I can kill him. But I gotta be close. Very close.
I don't think so.
I'm not hungry, oddly.
Thanks for the message.
Hey, cool tiger. Looks proud.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
I don't know...
So that's cool with you, then?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
But you copy my work every week.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Were we together?
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go. A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana, then the prom, then Vijay's parents' cabin.
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Well, yeah. You're the best friend I've ever had, even when you're being kind of evil.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
What is your job title, exactly?
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
What are you talking about?
Hon, did you get expelled?
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
Shut up.
Yeah.
No, she's working late tonight. She's trying to accrue some extra time off for when, you know...
Well, it can really only go two ways.
You don't have to do that.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
Why?
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.
Go learn something.
Most Fruitful Yuki is bad ass, man. You should be proud to be the same condition.
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
What are you?
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
You should try Adderall.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
What do you mean? You mean...  Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
There are ads? For parents?
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Share the love, Tits!
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
Hm.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
What?
A hotel?
Adele for god sake please lis...
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
Karma...  You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
Is it hard to learn?
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
What's Early been in jail for?
That's not true!
Thank you for what?  What are you thanking me for Adele?
I don't know. Wish I did.
Never heard of it, any huntin'?
How much do I owe you?
You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
Forget about it, doesn't matter.
A book on the warehouse murders?
Up yours.
You sure been acting like you were...  ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Why, what did he do?
What are you going to do?
Hell if I know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to Texas.
No, but I can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...That'd be my guess.
17.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Were they wearing condoms?
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
She can fuck?
Well, I was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
Yeah. It's like all I think about now. Not just that, it's like lately during sex, I start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
It is right.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
You down with the boost?
Yeah, that would be fun but I don't like any of the girls you go out with. Like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
Oh. You like her?
Yeah. She's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
Why I do what?
Good luck?
Shut the fuck up.
Yeah probably.
You goin'?
Hell ya. We broke that mothafucka.
I'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
Right now?
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
Yeah. I can understand that.
Trust me. Don't be nervous.
How do you know?
Do you care about me?
You think I want a baby? When you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
I wouldn't believe it?
Come dance.
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
Everything is wrong.
Are you in trouble with the law?
No, I didn't bleed.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
I only did it once and...
I don't know. Just some messy little scrap. You know that bullshit.
Yep.
That's right. That's why foreplay is better than sex.
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Holy shit. That's all true?
No. I was just kidding.
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
All right.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
Where does everyone sleep?
Yep.
Yo, let me get in your parent's room man. Just fir a little while.
You are!  I don't like you.
That's crazy!  Why would I draw attention to myself like that?
Not what -- who.  Morpheus.  The Greek God of dreams.  Look at the next line. "Her God has gone and left his home."
I wouldn't know.
Of course it was.  Otherwise I'd be breaking and entering.  That's a felony.
I used to.  With my old man.  He taught me how to hunt and trap.  Trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  We used to go after Raccoons mostly. They'd get into our garbage, our fields.  When an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  But they're crafty little devils.  You see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no Raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  You ever smell Raccoon scent?  Smells like shit, but to a male Raccoon it smells just like pussy.  He'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a Raccoon and stick his Goddam head right in it.  You know why?  Cause he can't help himself.  The scent drives him.  So, if you want to catch a Raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
It's all a big game isn't it?  A sick, fuckin' game.  I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
What's the first street?
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Anything?
You couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
Yes.  Why did you kill Debi Rutlege?
What?
Just like who?
You're not playing very well.  There are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
Then call them!
You heard me.  Why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
If you kill tonight and I'm in jail the police will know I'm innocent.
I know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
Mister Sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
1985.  Hans Korshaud.
You still haven't figured it out, have you?   You think that I've put you through an ordeal.  My scars run so much deeper than yours.
The scars on your chest.  From where I stabbed you with my fountain pen.
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
You're safe.  He wouldn't come here.
I see.  You forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
But you promised.
Not much.  There's no sign of a break in.  I think she let him in.
Any sign of rape?
Not a drop.  Maybe the guy works for the Red Cross.
Wait, I've saved the best for last. Andy, hit the lights, will you?
And this Jeremy--
This ain't no photo.
It can't be a coincidence.  The woman that owns it has a son.  She says he's been on vacation in Montana for the last ten days.  We're trying to locate him.  There's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  We're checking that out too.
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
To my room and then I went for a walk.
What's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  Yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. That would imply you already knew the number.
I don't know.  I was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  I can't afford to miss a game.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
That's got to be it.
Look, I'll do anything you want!  I'll sign anything you want!  Just send a car out to the hotel.
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
No.  I don't.
Uh huh.
Nothing.  I just came in for a steam.
No you didn't.
That's true -- but the emotion is still there.  They just learn to control it.
Of course.
Doesn't that scare you?
I'm sure you are.
Wasn't I just talking about me?
What's wrong?
For emphasis?
But what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  Violent?
What?
You really haven't seen my best side.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
Because I know what it says.
He didn't tell you either.
Well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
You're really not bad looking. Almost handsome.
You <u>might</u> be handsome. I can't tell through all that grime. Besides, you reek of sweat and horses.
We're not married <u>yet</u>.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
Colwyn. Colwyn.  I love you, Colwyn.
That way. I can feel the cold.
You have rope?
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
What do you see?
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
No. Then they were led by his underlings. But I knew he had come this time, from the ferocity of their onslaught, from their use of The Fortress. They use up much of their strength to do these things. They are taking great risks.
Yes.
Use your sword.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
It is my fate to die in the Fortress.
Yes.
Let me comfort you.
Smart as well as quick. Now what do you have to give us?
You will follow me.
That I promise you.
Hand over your dinner.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
I'm glad.  I'm very glad.
A small house.
I have a cinnamon bar.
I'd wish for a puppy.
A foolish wish. And you, Quell?
Many villagers are hiding in the forest. They need food.
And do you think I live on air?
Food for crows.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
No! Not yet! Let me hug it and kiss it a little.  Let me run my fingers over its lovely skin.  Let me climb to the top and sing to it.
These walls do not lie! He will betray you.
It is only a few weeks and already half our strong places have fallen.
Yes. We lost five.
How many did you lose?
It is the time.
I will seek the Fortress for you.
They will fail for, during the day, the power of the Circle is greater than theirs. Only at night can they pierce the Circle.
No maze to me, my fried. It is where we take refuge when they hunt us.
Yes.  Like you, a King. A King of many worlds. All enslaved.
It is not necessary. They will not follow.
It is fifty years since I spoke it to you.
Huh? I see, but this is the FBI, little girl, and I can't let you in.  But if you leave me his money, I'll give him it myself.
Yeah... How do you know it?
She told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! Can you believe it?!
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
No.
Come on, shit, tell me! Is he beautiful?
Yeah.
Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
Yeah... Well... I don't know.. I don't know any.
Look. When you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  When you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. When you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. When you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  Not very sure. You have one chance out of five to miss.  A contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  You can't miss a client. Never... If the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. That is, you insure yourself by another means.
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
Oh really?  But can you miss the car?
It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
OK.
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
What?
Yeah!... Anyway, I don't like hotels. Too much people, everyone's got the key... I don't like it.
Is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Mathilda, listen!
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
Huh... Yeah, yeah... Of course.
No...
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
I received my B.S. from the University of Pennsylvania, my P.H.D. from Bryn Mawr College.  I worked three years at the Boston University School of Medicine, during which time I had articles printed in the "Journal of Educational Psychology", "American Journal of Psychology", "Psychology Review" and "Science"... So I think it's safe to say my opinion is valid.
No it's not.
We're very sorry about that.  Some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
Thank you.
You do?
What's that?  That's not a fortune... You will be rich... That's a fortune.  What you have is a statement.
You can change.
He's plastered.
No really, if God takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
Good.
From where?
I see.
That's a reasonable assumption.
Jumped where?
That's me.
It has to be a full character's name.
Pulitzer, here I come.
This is a ghost town.  Nothing ever happens.
Write from your heart.  That's why the classics are great.
Why know?
So I've been informed.
I missed you to Mr. Parker.
Adelle told me, your writing is going well.  The Crusader for social issues and all.
Steph.
Are you working?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
I guess I do too.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
Are you serious.
You do?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I don't understand any of that.
Hey Ben. There were a couple of guys looking for you.
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Please, Yuri.
It's me, Yuri.
I can't tell you.
Get up.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
That's just it -- it would ruin me!
He did leave a Cher tape in the pool house once --
No.
Yes.
That's right. Because isn't the first cardinal rule of perm maintenance that you are forbidden to wet your hair for at least twenty-four hours after getting a perm at the risk of de-activating the ammonium thiglycolate?
Thank you.
Just the love in my heart.
Uh -- both?
Aristotle.
What'd you do?
I couldn't help it! It was the most fun I've had since I've been in law school. Not only was I good enough for Warner -- I was better than him. He has to see serious I am now. Even Donovan was impressed, and he's a total hard-ass.
Look at him. He's still scratching his head.
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
Yes, you are.
And Donovan's a scumbag for coming on to you.
Hell, yes. We've got finals to study for. In Jamaica.
Thank you. I love you, too.
Why, yes, Margot, I do. Once again, we joined Hope in the search for her identity. As you know, she's been brainwashed by the evil Stefano --
I wasn't gonna --
You're serious?
Wait -- Hilary Clinton.
I'm quitting.
Oh, my God!!
I don't know! I don't know anything any more!  I just need to be by myself.
You should. Do you have a resume?
And engraved... Gives it that extra little something, doesn't it?  See you tomorrow!
Uh, no. Maybe you should try the Lido deck.
My family expects a lot from me. And I expect a lot from me. I plan on running for office some day.
Elle -- no -- your boobs are fine --
I have to think about my future. And what people expect from me.
Harvard. Law school.
Tell me about it. I can't imagine doing all this and Donovan's internship next year.
I gave her my word, Warner.
Where?
Chuck.
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
You go to lady now?
Grotesque... monstrous...
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do it now!
Your soul...?  Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
And, now?
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Cathay?
Country fa' fa' away.  To the East, beyond the lising sun...
Dlagon not like that.  Dlagon is spilit of life... spilit of stlength and goodness.
There's a coil of golden thread fine as spider web yet naught can break it... and a silver key no lock can resist.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Faerie ring?
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Jenny Greenteeth?  Who's she?
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm.  Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that.  But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
You do the praying.  I've work ahead.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Good plan that.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Stealing his arms?
That would be Devil's Needle.  Last landmark I know in these woods.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Certainly understandable.
We're blind now.  Oona was our eyes and ears.  How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
We do both.  Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
There aren't enough arrows.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Nonsense!  Course it matters.
Nay.  You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
Sunlight, you say?
He'll not escape me.
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
Never.
Or perchance...
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
What shall we do?
Be patient.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
To fetch your napkin.
Damned hunters.  It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Good.  They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
What?
Sunlight?
So, he's hiding in the dark...
Ow!  Whatever it is, it hurts.
Another hero's hand-me-down... Thurgis, note the armor; tis Greek work.
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
A unicorn's been slain.  The last stallion in all the country.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
How do I get the horn back?
What became of the princess?
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Small miracles better than no miracles...
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
I thought I might stop by.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
I wanted him to marry her.
I thought I was helping you.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Months.
I did tell you, didn't I?  That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
All of us are typing and clicking, George.  Whether we want to, or not.
I'm not.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear.  My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like.  You haven't been listening, have you?
What can I do for you, George?
Thank you.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Oh...okay.
I didn't recognize you!
Why would you be there?
I'll hate you forever.
Goodnight.
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
What are you now?
I know parts of who you are.
He's got nothing to do with me.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
I was just thinking about my mom.  She wouldn't leave him.  I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  I mean it was dark outside and in.  But we never talked about it.
I would have killed him.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
No, but I count them.  In a sock isn't new, you know?
Well, congratulations!  You fucking pulled it off!
Thanks for telling me.
At least your father tried, George.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
Oh.  Sorry.
Because Dad left?
Why call me?
I drove over and you were gone.
Last time you were gone for a week!
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was.  Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good.  It's been a long time.
Finished or unfinished?
This was my very first slow dance.
I smiled at him.
What?
The payoff.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
Despite you.
Please don't leave me.
No.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
Enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
Nagger?
She's doing just fine.
Cost you a pair of nylons.
Come on, Biscuit, this is good news. Your mama's gonna break down in tears when you show up on her doorstep.
Can't Get Right? That's the kid's name? Can I talk to him?
My name's Yvette. Sylvia sent me. You look just like she said.
You know, go to the tonk or whatever.
Yes, boss.
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
It's a hell of a lot longer when you're innocent.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
You? Dine and ditch, right?  Over ten bucks?  You're probably looking at a thumb.
A thumb? What do you mean, like cut it off? For ten bucks?  That include the tip?
Look, ma'am, we've been driving all day. We'd just like to purchase one of those pies and we'll be on our way.
You're soft.
Don't get all agitated on me. I bought a bottle of rum from a couple of dudes, I heard 'em talking...
Let me get this straight. We drove all the way down to Klan country 'cause you heard a couple of guys talking?
What are you complaining about? It worked out. Everything's cool. Now, come on, let's head down there and see what's shaking. We deserve a little reward.
There are people down there having fun. I want to be one of them. I want you to be one of them. On Monday you can be a bank teller if you want, but tonight you're a bootlegger with a truck full of Puerto Rican rum and a fistful of cash.
Fuck that cheap-ass watch --  I mean, how the hell are we gonna get home without any money?
Winston. His name's Winston.
Hell with him then. If he can't share the driving, he can't ride in the truck.
If it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at Coney Island right now.  "I need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."
Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard.
Cookie didn't draw it. I did.
What am I gonna eat?
Hey, man, is Babe Ruth in the lineup today?
So, Blocker, what do you think of our boy?
Whatever.
I'm not gonna let it go. The man needs to explain himself. Makin' promises.
Well, if that's the way it is...
Hey, I'm a lonely old man. I like to talk, too. So why don't we start by talking about what kind of a plan you're working on?
Back to New York for starters.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
You heard the boss! Let's move!
Movin' it out, boss.
I think that old man lost his marbles about a hundred years ago. Come on, let's get this over with.
Hey, Willie, what was Claude's plan, anyway?
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Goddamn it, Wilkins, would you please just shoot the nigger!
You mean the Boom-Boom Room?
That's it. The Boom-Boom Room. Sure would like to see that place when you get it up and running.
I hear a train coming. Drink.
It's just such a slap in the face.
Well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Don't do it!
Show him Central Park.
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
I think you're looking at him.
Everything's fine, pop.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
This is bullshit, man.  I'm gonna win the Superbowl this year, with or without you!
Definitely.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
Beast.
I'm just a demon, Nicky. I don't got devil blood in me. I'd last two minutes up there with your brothers.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
Yeah. You do it.
We know where to find Nicky.
That way.
I don't need luck. I'm good.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
If you want to.
My perfume?
Good. I was concerned.
Basically, yeah.
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
I have to, Valerie.
That was Cassius!
No.
A black guy?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
What other food?
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Why did you do that???!!!
Where do you live, Mary?
No.  Just no.
I suppose. But what if you want to live?
Then it's still no.
Why tell me?
How can I?
A Runner gave it to me.
Speak to your friends for me, Jessica... please...
Of course --
We're coming to Arcade.  Shall we Relive together?
Insane. Nurseries are better than any mother could be.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure.
Why, Jessica? You're still a green.
Ycch.  To kill things and then eat them. It must have been a savage world.
Then the answer's yes...
Beloved wife...
Do you want to see Doc?
For as long as I can remember.
Just a place, I suppose... who knows?
Mother and -- ? You knew your mother and father?
Can you make it back?
Okay.
There's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Sure.
Me, too.
So what do we do?
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Pornos.
How'd it happen, Alice?
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
Why are ya goin' so early?
Alice, I...
He is? I didn't think you knew Dick. How do you know he's dead?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
What is this? Why didn't you tell me? What?... I don't remember any of this.
Did you tell the police this?
Yes.
I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
No... I don't. Why?
Not even close.
No.
No... There is, I mean, I use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
Headache, huh? Too much sun, I guess. You want to come in?  Still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
I guess so.
He's got some fucked up friends.
I thought there might be somebody inside.
I can see that.
What'd I tell ya.
Yeah. Give ya a boner.
Okay... Well, I'll see ya then.
Hey, Pete... How ya doin'?
You're doin, okay?  That's good, Pete.
Whatiya mean?
I don't want to talk about it...
Oh, read it!
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
Uh-huh.
Not at all.
You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
Okay, brother.
Okay, sister.  No offense. No offense!
I say, good morning, Lovey.
Is it?
Yes!
I'm thinking.
Have I?
Certainly not!
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Look, Bob!
You mean you don't want to go?
You know, that's the fourth time you've said that today. You should have a record made of it.
We follow many.
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
Yes. Oddly enough, later, when he had learned to understand their language, the natives told him he could have saved his leg. It would have healed without amputation.
And very true. Your lives are therefore, as a rule, shorter, not so much by natural death as by indirect suicide.
And he can arrange for the porters to take us back?
The High Lama arranges everything, Mr. Conway.
Well, then he's the man I want to see.  Will you come along?
Amazing!  She still doesn't look over 20. When is she likely to grow old in appearance?
No, I mean about her appearance. If she should leave the valley - what would happen?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Simply preposterous. Do you know what I did last night? Last night, Mr. Chang, I held a sort of a self- inventory. I said to myself last night, Mr. Chang, I said, "Lovey"—  Mr. Lovett! "Mr. Lovett," I said, "you are an ungrateful fool . . . "
Well, Mr. Chang, I thought, with your permission of course, and while I'm waiting for these porters, I would like to organize classes for those children in the valley and teach them something practical and something useful. Geology.
Hello? Colonel?
You?
Yes, Bob.
You'd better try to get some sleep, Bob.
Of course you would. If ever we get out of this place, the thing for you to do is to take that job with Helen's father.
Chang's first question was about the pilot.
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
All right. Sorry, George.
Porters?
Why - I'm sorry - but I—
I don't need any proof.
What else could it mean to me? It's obviously a lot of bunk.
Maria?
I'm not wrong. She told me so. Besides, she wouldn't have to tell me. I'd know anyway.  I found out a lot of things last night.  I'm not ashamed of it either. It's probably one of the few decent things that's ever happened in this hellish place.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
That was easy. I read your books.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
A little boy whistling in the dark!? Do you realize that there is a British cruiser waiting at Shanghai, smoke pouring out of its funnels, tugging at its moorings, waiting to take Mr. Conway back to London? Do you know that at this minute there are headlines shrieking all over the world the news that Conway is missing? Does that look like a man whose life is empty?
When the plane lands at Shangri-La and wakes us all up.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Why?
Why, mother?
Why?
I don't care what you've got started. Do you want to go?
You'll wait till you rot!
Perhaps.
Cowan--
Wait.  Uh-- sir.  Please.  Anyway.  Hook-head-guy.  I'm thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" Answer: that's not his head. Then I think--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually ONE GUY and--
Hang on. -- And this is the good part; when you're fully ordained, he'll come when you call him, too.  Dave.
DON'T "SIR" ME-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.
Why?  What are you gonna do?
What?
You heard me.  You two, especially.
Oh. Right.  I guess that's kind of cool, too, in it's own way.  Course, this isn't really black; it's kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, isn't it?
So what's the problem?
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
I'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. I see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
Hey, I was workin' her.  I was workin' my thing.
It was a long time ago.-
Hang on.  There's gotta be something on this guy.    Did you contact the Alliance?  Do they have anything?
Everything left the planet, right? Except one thing.    That little insect-- the one we found in Sudbury.  Did it leave when everything else left?
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
I'd prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
Oh, yeah, well, you know.  I'm a big fan.  I've read all your work.
Actually... I don't know.
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
You figured what?
I figured it didn't matter.  It's my last day of business.   I was wrong.  I'm sorry.  Hey, look what I got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --One of the good ones, too, with zoids.
How could it not?
Come on now.  People are smart.
Did he say where?
Scientific American?  Really?
Hard to tell.  I hope not.
Keep an eye on things there.  We'll see what we can find out at Ernie Goosels.
They went to the President? Directly? THEY WENT OVER OUR HEADS?
Can you see the balloon man?
Please --
She grew up.
Then who was he?
Whatever you say, John.
I know you're in a hurry, so I juiced up the nano-reconstruction around your new eyes.
Drowning.
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
For that, we have to go for a ride.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
It's actually kind of a rush.  They say you get visions; that your life flashes before your eyes.  That all your dreams come true.
Don't apologize, John.
I'm saying the third prevision wasn't there.  And that's not all. I spent a few hours down there and it turns out there's a dozen more cases with missing previsions.
So give him a tour.  He doesn't know enough to ask the right questions.
I hear you've been spending a lot of time in the sprawl.
We won't let them.
Somebody named Leo Crow.
I have no idea.  I've never heard of him.  But I'm supposed to kill him in less than thirty-six hours.
You know I can't do that.  You can't do that...  Lamar, I need you to talk to Wally, see if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.  Then ask Jad for any off hour EYEdents into the analytical room --
Everybody runs.
Armor up -- sick-sticks and concussion guns -- this is gonna be close.
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Send a DCPD blue & white out there, set up a perimeter and tell 'em we're en route.  What's our confirmed time?
Nope.  Somebody's thinking about this one.
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Still scrubbing... looks like there's a third party, somebody wearing shades just out the window...
The Precogs don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.
Really?  You've never been inside?
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.
I don't know.  He was shot and killed when I was fourteen on the steps of his church in Bethesda.
So now I need you to hack into her.
Tell me how.
All right, I'll try...
Wanna hear something funny?
I forgive you.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Hold your breath, Dad...
If you don't kill me, my family gets nothing!
I don't know -- I never saw his face.  All I know is, the next day I was out, so the guy must've had juice somewhere.  Look, man, you gotta go through with this.
What the fuck is going on?
Who made you do this?
I'm... not... a... killer.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them.  He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things.  Precrime.  The precogs. You.
You say some of the children died?
So many of them... despite what we did for them.  Or maybe because of what we did to them.  It doesn't matter.  It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
Not if I stay away from him.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
Then how did he --
No, it isn't, Lamar.  There was nothing anyone could do.
I don't know who that is.
Thank you.  This is Burgess.
Why are you protecting him?  You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing about it.
None of your damn business.
Wait, just a second...
Yes.
He can't download her without a lot of technical help.
I don't know, why?
I know who you are.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
But I've seen the three hundred hours of your image he's got stored away.
Tell me how all this works.
What does he want with a precog?
Jesus...
Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
Yes, sir.
Just tell me. Wait, here... Do you have change of a hundred?
Not on me, sir.
Don't worry about me getting in. Just tell me where it is.
Manhattan.
What happened? I thought we were playing Truth or Dare.
Should I fuck him?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
You gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
Hi, baby. What are you doing awake? Where's mommy?
Who's watching the baby?
I'm ready.
Don't expect you to mention it to him. I'm just saying, if --
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
Go.
Good! It'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. He's not fucking driving you!
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
How could you let her see this?
Goodbye, Bobby.
What'd you say?
Come on, dude. The other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. I know the drill, I'll wear a rubber --
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
Shit.
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
Yeah?
And not a word to Maxie. He'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
Me? No. Not really.
Why?
They're fucking yeshiva buchas. You didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. You knocked out a guys teeth.
Not driving Jess, you won't.
You're not driving Jess no more. Two strikes, Bobby, and this last one was big. The bachelor's father goes to my schul.
I didn't say that.
I know.
Ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to Ruiz. It's up to me, and I like a sure thing. Just go and we're square on the tooth.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
You want --
You want us to be wherever you want us to be, ASAP, no questions asked.
Now that Limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. Maxie's gonna shit a Nokia when he hears about... Aw, shit, I better call him before he hears.
Bobby.
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Harlem? What is it, a restaurant?
No. That's cool, man.
Ruiz isn't here.
Thanks.
How am I being shitty?
I wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I'll page you.
Yeah. Page me. You know the number?
I'll page you with the number.
Bye.
Shhh...
He implied it.
Sorry coach.
Who's driving her?
Forty-six.
Yeah, I guess.
You gotta be kidding me. I vouched for you.
You got something to say --
Well, I thought you understood and I was just missing it.
Damn right. Bring us two bottles of Dom Champs and here, take fifty in case I call you bitch later when I'm drunk.  Siddown, motherfucker.  'Sex and paychecks.'
Hey, Jimmy, where they taking us?
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
You couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
Why?
You wanna see how fast I get a gun?
Eighty bucks?!?
Eighty five.
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
Let's just go now and wait.
You're not getting a gun.
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
Maybe you wanna try the China Club.
The videos.
What? Why am I bad?
You really in trouble?
Come, now. You just got here.
Motherfucker, we're handing you money. What the hell we gonna pull?
Jimmy? Ruiz. Pick up Maxie's guineas at LUNA and bring them to Spa.  Jimmy's bringing the car around. Me and Ho rode sleds. We'll meet you at Spa in the VIP room.
You know my pager number?
We're square.
Keys.
Four mimosas.  You'll love them. So here's the plan. I didn't say shit to Maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and I don't want to get him all worked up.
He has a cute what...?
When all this is over and we're not working for Maxie, I'd love to run into you on the street.  Why aren't you coming?
Bet you like that shit.
When?
Just now.
I keep all my numbers in my head. I've never written any down.
You know it.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I don't know. It doesn't matter. The thing is we got to get you back on your feet.
Yeah.
Elijah Muhammad can get you out of prison. Out of the prison of your mind. Maybe all you want is another fix. I thought you were smart.
What? Everybody knows God is White.
Then the devil is white.
No. Elijah Muhammad does not say "that white man is a devil." He teaches us that the white man is the devil. All white men.
I will not touch the white man's poison: his drugs, his liquor, his carrion, his women.
I can't.
For evil to bend its knee, admit its guilt, implore His forgiveness, is the hardest thing on earth --
-- the hardest and the greatest.
You want a new car? You want a new house? Is that it? It's the money, right?
Come, sit with us.
I'm sorry. I've had you on your feet for hours.
They want you to quit the Muslims or they won't pay your tuition, isn't that it?
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
How old are you, Betty?
Are you?
Hush your mouth.
Because you're in trouble.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do you want me to do?
Shhh!
We had the best organization that black people ever had and niggers ruined it.
Dear heart, where are you?
Let some of us come down there.
You left one phrase out. Another educated Kneegrew said to me and I quote: "Brother Malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the Negro subculture." Would you agree?
Thank you. Now the Negro in the field caught hell all day long. He was beaten by the master; he lived in a shack, wore castoff clothes and hated his master. If the house caught fire, he'd pray for a wind. If the master got sick, he'd pray that he'd die. And if you said to him, "Let's go, let's separate", he'd yell, "Yeah, man, any place is better than this." You've got a lot of Field Negroes in America today. I'm one.
Sure, man.
"His greatest greatness."
Do your job, Get me a bourbon on the rocks and a pack of Lucky's.
Two years in the Women's Reformatory at Framingham.
I mean it's late, baby.
Why? Is it because of your white gal? Folks say you're running around town with her.
-- there is a serious question as to whether --
Please make way, please --
I'm with you, Brother Minister.
Me?
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Jesus ain't got nothin' to do with this.
Jesus Christ, Homey, you are nuts.
Come on, baby. I don't pay that shit no mind.
I was special. The only colored kid in class. I became a sort of mascot. Like a pink poodle.
What do you want?
I don't know shit about you.
It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
[Where are you staying in Mexico?]
I'll call you tomorrow.
[So you're married to him? And this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[The boss did or his brother.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[You are Jorge Ramirez.]
[Ordered by who?]
[Where do I find him?]
[The one who transferred Pinta to their car.]
[I'm a businessman. A dead girl is worth nothing. She is alive.]
[O.K. So tell me more.]
And what if amateurs try it?
Nothing wrong.
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
I know it's old fashioned, but it's reliable. Like us.
If they like me.
The United States.
I'm looking for potential.
Oh...
[Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
You were never late before, I was worried.
Could I stop you?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Planned what?
You're lying. I don't believe you.
[The money, 10 million U.S. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the K&R agent. Then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[The car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
I'm trying, mom.
What? Who?
Why? You were so pleased with him.
[No. Not by the rules of polite society at least.]
Yes. But if I traced Creasy to you, others will do it as well. Their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
What was she to Creasy then?
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
We just talked.
I came to see you. How you feel?
I feel fine.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Your son Marty?
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
Thank you.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Nothing.
Okay.
Okay.
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Marty, see that my mother is nice and comfortable, eh?
You gonna get married.
You not ugly.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
Hiya, Ralph...
...I been talking about two nurses Leo and me picked up in a bar on Seventy-First Street.
So, Marty, lemme tell you about these nurses, Marty...
Well...
Hello, Thomas.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
So she say, "You're spilling the milk." So she kept talking about these coupla drops of milk I spilled, so she got me so mad, so I said, "Mama, you wanna see me really spill some milk?" So I took the bottle, and I threw it against the door. I didn't throw it at her. That's just something she made up. She goes around telling everybody I threw the bottla milk at her. I didn't throw it anywheres near her. Well, I was sorry right away, you know, but she ran outta the house.
Sure, sure.
Virginia, I don't wanna hear no more about it!
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Where?
Back home.
No.  Or why you should.
Epidural hematoma?
I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
That's okay. Live a little, learn a little.
What the hell's going on here?
When he sees a little running room, he likes to make a show... you know, stutter steps and cross-overs and all that jazz. Also he never learned to button up when he gets hit, so if you two can get a good shot at him once, you can hurt him.
There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
I done my shopping in Seoul last night.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
An application to Androscoggin College.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
Same here. You can retire my number.
Any time. Whenever we want.
But no short-arm inspection. I'm with you there.
We're a good team.
Anyway, we want to get this letter off.
I can't... couldn't.
Finest kind. We're training Ho-Jon to be a bartender. Join us?
Damn right. Three to one, as much as you want to put up.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
Right.
So if it ain't staring us in the face, it's got to be retroperitoneal. And that, along with the look of the wounds, makes me figure he's got a hole in his sigmoid colon that we won't find unless we look for it.
I found a doner.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
I like an olive.
The black capsule. Finest kind. Thank you, Dr. McIntyre.
Oh, you want to play it straight?  I guess I owe you an apology.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Your high school friend who went around saying 'Me lay, you lay?' to all the young females in the community. As I remember, you said it was quite a successful approach.
And if it isn't, why don't we call Washington on your telephone? You tell your story, we'll tell ours.
If we don't get that pint, he's in trouble.
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
I'm glad you feel that way, Major, because you see it's a team effort... doctors, nurses, enlisted men... and I feel responsible for my whole team, and I want you to know I'm satisfied with them.
Same here.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
You should have been a marriage counselor.  But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
I don't liking it at all, what I hear when I listen to the heart. And such a blood pressure for so young a boys. Is frightening.
Duke...
Thanks.
Glad to help.
Tell me the whole story, Walt.
Just in dreams?
Just about enough to say goodbye to everybody.  Line up over here, men, if you want to pay your last respects. Keep moving and file on out when you're through.
That. It's out of the act.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
Major Burns will be out of your tent in twenty-four hours.  Tell them Captain Pierce and Captain Forrest are on their way.
I deeply regret this unfortunate incident. We try to remember we're a military organization.
Yes, sir, I'll see if I can reach General Hammond in Seoul for you. You think he'll finally break down and give us two more surgeons?
Sir?
Yes, Colonel.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
In that case, here are ten basic plays. I think that's about all this bunch can handle.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
Do it, and I'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
The Websters!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
There is no letter. I made it up.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
John Doe.
So?
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
That's—
Has he been here?
I ain't seen him for a week.
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
Th—that's all right. If you didn't call me Sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  There are snickers from the background.
A what?
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
John Doe Club?
Hiyah, John.  John, I want to have a little talk with you.  What's the matter—are you falling? Come here.
You betcha.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up.  Oh, Ned!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now.  Amateur journalism, huh!  I'll show those guys.
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball.
There! You see? He admits it! You're a fake, John Doe! And for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and I hope they do it!
Oh!
That's too bad.
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
Shh!
I think it must have been a sea- gull.
I don't know.
It's not me. It's her. She's going out with this baseball player -- Greg Barnett.
Good. I don't want to be late.
How can I help you with the particles?
I need to get something straight first.
Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
You're gettin' the car.
Hi, Kimura. Where's the command post?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
That's right.
Yep.
I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
She's going to come here when she graduates and then we're gonna get married.
Do you really?
Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
So what do I say to this guy?
Yes.
Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?
Why?
You're a compulsive gambler?
That's okay. That's his style.
COME ON, RUSSELL!
How much you wanna bet?
Occasionally you lose.
He's cutting down the visibility.
So what do you want to do?
Stay put.
Husband came home. Found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". Now he's holding her at knife point.
You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
Greg.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
Maybe you should be.
You heard.
It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
Ronnie...
He was going nuts at the park. He met this very attractive poodle. They made plans to meet again next weekend.
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
Define concern.
His name's Kevin McCall. Every Metro Captain agrees that he's their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
Okay, I think I could swing that.
Yes.
You're in there.  Everybody dies, you go with them --
-- But don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Because I took it out of your memory.
Yes.
Guests?
From the dream.
The new world.
-- But you'll never be able to get it through the maze.
-- Two million people plugged-in here.
How long?
The weather.
There is no --
Of course they are.  Christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
What?
Why?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
Not his style.
Where?
Cleaning up a mess.
No.
Then how do you know about --
For what?
Yes.
I know.
Destination?
-- Transmit now!
-- Waiter.
Scanning body type.
Ah... sure.
Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension.
In another time, another dimension.  It was brought here long ago by the "Nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. They built an impenetrable stone Monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  For thousands of years, beings from all over the Universe have tried to obtain it... ALL have perished.
Tommy, you are the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky.
Quack like a'duck!
You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you!
GO POWER RANGERS!
When the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
What are ya tellin' me, Charlie?
Charlie Luciano.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
Hey, I ignore my wife too. But on our honeymoon I paid attention.
You scare me, Charlie.
I came into this world flat on my ass.
I trust Mr. Johnson filled you in on the revisions.
Mr. Rothstein, Can I be frank? You're a gambler, and I know you've had losses. I also know you could sell to Maranzano or Masseria for fifty G's, but nobody sells to those guys once. So if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, I ain't gonna beef.
You got men on Profaci's place?
That ain't what your mama said.
I'm already late.
Same here.
It's a mask.
Ya never tell a guy about a broad.
Who'll make the rules?
Lansky. Meyer Lansky. And that's Bugsy Siegel ya got there.
The minute we sell out to Maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
It's nothin'. I'm gettin' married.
Well, good. Woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
Whatta ya mean? It's great!
I been thinkin'...
It's not myself I'm worried about.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
I know about you.
MONEY DON'T MEAN SHIT!
Why should I go against you, Boss? Nobody can handle this business like you. Maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. He's got no business bein' Boss. The idea makes me wanna puke. You're the Boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
But that's an hour's drive.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Not a lot ta know.
He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
Keep my terms and I won't be your enemy.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
The Big Picture.
Jesus.
Hell. It's been four days!
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. And of course, I need not <u>add</u> -
Oh, sure. Now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. You were completely innocent -
<u>Why</u>??
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> I guess I'm yours now.
Herb. <u>I have to go</u>.
Why?
Nine AM! But that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
Me? <u>Me</u>, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
Oh yeah. There's just one thing I don't get. "Monkeybone Creator Awakens from Coma" that's a big story! That's front page news! But I can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> Hey. Don't I have a TV show?
I need a new PR guy.
Heirloom? Huh? You want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
I might wake up.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
You're such a beautiful man. Look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
<i></i> I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
My daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  Is that true?
And you don't deal drugs?
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
That's why it's good you came to visit me.
What pictures?
Mother!
He seemed quite taken with you.
My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people.
If it's about the bikers, dear, I don't want to talk about it.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Really?
What happened?
... Manly?
What do you think?  I left it on the curb?
Nah, not dangerous.  Not that dangerous.  Not during the day.
Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that man was a great orator.
Right up there over the Vice- President's chair--the four in the front row represent the four big news services. You've met the press bunch, haven't you?
It was?
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Eight to five Little Boy Blue is plastered.
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
You got worms.
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
Oh--yeah--
Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of here!
I'll cherish ya.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
Where?
Susan? Nah!
You said it!
Why me?
That infernal phone!
Can't that wait, Hubert?
All right, why?
*Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That long-haired--! Why, you should have killed that so fast--!
I *won't* let you stand there callously and perhaps wreck my whole political future!
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Is *what* getting me down?
Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?
Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
Boy! My head's like a balloon--for two whole days. I never knew there was so much American history.
For a question!
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
His last fight was his best, Jeff. He and his little four-page paper against that mining syndicate and all to defend the right of one small miner who stuck to his claim. You know, they tried everything, bribery, intimidation, then--well--
Nonsense, Jeff.
Here--where are you running off to?
Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have risen to a painful duty--to say that, out of evidence that has come to my attention, I consider Senator Smith unworthy to address this body!
Jefferson--
How's Amos, Ma?
We'd better see.
You're a liar!
*No*!
There *what* was?
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
Convene?
Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a sort of fine thing to do--see Washington's home just before walking into the Senate for the first time-- don't you think?
You *couldn't*?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a *Bill*?
A *day*!
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Committee, huh?
Yes, I see that.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
I take it your--your parents couldn't-- uh--
It hasn't been easy, has it?
Saunders. That's better.  Good morning, Saunders. Hello, Saunders. How's the bill coming, Saunders--?
Why?
Abigail.
No!
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Saunders--!
Saunders--
I'm not.
Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the only thing to do. Don't you think?
What you *have* to do is fight!
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
That's what I said--the *truth*!
How are the pigeons?
That's--that's splendid.
The Senator has no voice in this chamber until the oath of office has been administered!
Well--I can *manage*--
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to do with it? I don't blame the guy.  Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town and nothing but dog-fights! And things aren't bad enough--last night I have to get a run-around from some wise dame--
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
Yes--a camp bill that will never get beyond a first reading. So calm down, Chick--and--goodnight.
That's dynamite, Joe!
Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--  This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
Well, well!
No?
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
You deserve a lot better. And I'll tell you what we'll do. Stay and play nurse, as you say--and if certain things happen I'm taking everybody up with me, and you'll get one of the biggest jobs in Washington.
What are you talking about? What difference--?
Jim--suppose we didn't try to go through with this Willet Creek Dam-- suppose we postpone it until the next session of Congress--or drop it altogether--
Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask *Smith* over here!
Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. This boy's different. He's honest and beside he thinks the world of me. We can't do this to him.
Just a minute, Joe!
And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man-- these days.
Senator Paine.
I present the credentials of Honorable Jefferson Smith who has just been appointed Senator by the Governor of my state.
Yes.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
Why not?
And you saw them happen?
Yes, but I—
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
What?
Nothing—
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
All right.
No, I don't mind.
Uh-huh.
Huh?
You're acting like a school girl.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
Did it?
Hurry up!
Gold, eh?
Is that the best you've got?
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her.  Get a smaller bowl, will you?
We'll send for the police!
Let me go!
Mr. Cedar!
Mr. Cedar!
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
How do you do.
No?
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  Send him in.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
I've got one for Cobb—
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
No, thanks.
That's funny. Why is that?
Entertainment?
What're you talking about?
Oh.
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil.  I was watching you.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Uh-huh.
Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Of course they're going to stay.  She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top?  Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
I don't care how much it is. You sit right there and eat your lunch. You haven't touched a thing.
Christian Svenson.
South Dakota - north?
Thank you so much. Good night.
Yes, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Very good, sir.  Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir.  I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Get out.  The evil finger's on you. Get out!
You try it.
Yeah.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
Doubtful. What did he say?
What's that?
Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford?
You never got back to me.  ...I called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... Kind of a professional welcome.
How do you mean?
What kind of doubts?
About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
-- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew --
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip.
Nope.
You've done well.
What do you think's wrong with her?
Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
I'm sorry, your honor.
What?
Well, come on in.
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
Got a license?  But no car?
Martin.
That's right, the fake kind.
Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Even if you don't think it's real?
I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that.
What would you do?
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time.  It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
You've got a funny idea of funny.
Really? What would it take?
Yeah, most people have that. It's confusing here.
Life.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
Yes.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why?
And this is legitimate therapy?
Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone.
Either one.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
Transference.
Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
You deserve it.
Anything... just ask.
What do you mean, "in no time"?
Uh-huh.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
Far out. Single malt?  Can I pick it?
Have you thought about getting a wife?
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Unbelievable...  ...And Lily named her dog after him? Far out.
Problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. Nothing can live up to it. His wife got sick of it and left him. Took his kids with her.
Yep.
You don't think I'm insane?
Really?
What about everything? How did this happen?
An IRS investigator with a drug problem?
Didn't need one. We didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. Man, the IRS... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. Nobody wants to argue with the IRS.
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
What'd I do?
Yep.
I suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
'Cause I look good doin, it.
You left me! You left me in the desert to rot.
What friend? You're my only friend.
Immune from what?
What are you looking for? Lie, and I'll slit your throat.
That's one way of putting it.
It will be done. But what of the American expedition? They leave tomorrow as well.
Yeah, get me a glass of bourbon, a shot of bourbon and a bourbon chaser.
No.
No, I mean --
I found sand. I saw death.
Why would they bury somebody in the ceiling?
I know, you're wondering, what's a place like me doing in a girl like this?
Okay, I get your father, I get your mother and I get your brother, but what are you doing here?
And what is that?
Not unless you call me Rick.
That bad huh?
It's just a book, no harm ever came from a book.
No, we are not.
That's what I am to you? A contract?
FINE.
The creature!? Are you sure!?
You lied to me!
Still...
Don't blame me, I don't even remember being there.
Well neither do I, thank you.
What's it look like!?
Yes,... I see.
Yeah? Well,... I'm sure she's not a total loss.
Um, well, you see...
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
What are you going to do? Shoot him?
Yes, I know, I do that to people.
Um-hmm.
I'm the Bowler.
I can't.
But you're a superhero.
But in fact... you'd found it.
Elizabeth! Little Elizabeth! Why you're so... middle aged!
Why bother?
Against.
You're dead.
Just a waitress.
I'd love to hear you read it. Could you stick around after the luncheon?
Why not?
Who?
Every night.
Why?
It is?
Most people just want to make money or be famous or something. But you risk everything, just to help people.
It's home.
Me, too.
I just want to be a superhero.
Are you nuts? Get out of there!
Yeah yeah -- and that, too.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
I used to believe that. Now I'm not so sure.
SO WHAT?
What a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
So you're chicken?
Or flowers.
See ya tomorrow.
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
Archenemies! Casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. Stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
Anybody got any?
And these are my associates, the Shoveler.
We take the licks and he gets the chicks.
Or Batman --
The bazookas?
And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
I have given a great deal of thought to that possibility, and I am prepared to face it.  If it should come to war, and I presume that is what you are alluding to, I would rather have war with the Emperor than my own people.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
Rostopchin is a fanatic and he is capable of anything -- however, it doesn't affect what we are talking about.  Please go on.
I have no doubt that he has, Your Majesty, but does he have any strong moves from which to choose?
Fascinating!  Tell me, leaving aside the question of grand strategy, for the moment, what would you say is the single most difficult tactical skill to master?
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
We expect an attack on the Convention tomorrow morning, at daybreak, and I have been placed in charge of its defense.
Are you serious?
There are none here.
Where are they?
Properly arranged, yes.
I must be honest with you.  I first approached three generals more senior than yourself, and they all very prudently sent excuses.
They are at the gates of Paris, sire.
But who made this treaty?
And where is Joseph?
I don't know, sire -- she had the Tsar's personal physician.
Bertrand, sire.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
I thought so, I noticed your name when you were announced.  I'm Corsican too -- my name is Arena.
I thought not.  I noticed you by yourself, all night.
Ah, Didier -- you are alive.
Indeed you have, Ambassador.  Have you sent for a doctor?
I beg your indulgence, Ambassador, but it is.
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected.  How do you expect me to find yours?
I very much doubt that he will.
Francis, may I ask whether you wear warm winter underwear?
Do you have three francs, sir?
Oh, I'm sorry about that.
Only Lisette?
That's a very nice name.  Where are you from?
Junot?
You would tell me, Joseph, wouldn't you?
The comedy of my marriage is sufficiently well known already.
I have no idea.  Her maid said she left two days ago, to meet me -- I can imagine where she is.  But when she finally does come home, she will find her things in the street and my door locked.
No.
Were any of them prettier than I am?
Promise me.
I will never forgive you.
Go away -- I'm busy.
Don't be ridiculous and go away -- I'm busy working.
Indeed -- well, you may tell Dr. Corvisart, I should be entirely satisfied with half her success.
Certainly.
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
What are you talking about?
I wrote it.
About Hippolyte Charles.
Do you know what you're saying?
How do you know?
I know.
Yes.
I am sure you will enjoy the French countryside.
Yes, he has.
My dear Talleyrand, none of the Kings of Europe bear any friendship for France.  It is easy for you to talk of reliable treaties.  The only treaties you have been able to negotiate are the ones I have won on the battlefield.
Send him in.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
Anything you need.
Well, let me in.
I don't know!
I said shut up!  Now who sent you?
I know, we had a good time.  But ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
Thanks, I just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
Man, it's a long story.  I met D'Wana three months ago.  She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn't pay it no attention.  Come to find out, she six months pregnant.  Saying I'm the daddy!
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Damn, you got a stalker.
I know what 'cha thinking.  I thought the same thing.  But it can't happen.
If you 'get into it' with them S.A.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  I gotta live here.  Just remember that.
I don't.
That ain't gonna work.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Nothing.
What's the B-G's?
No, man, just wait.
What about me?
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
To the Cucamonga shopping center.
My brothers won't give me a ride.
I don't know.
I'm sorry for what my brother did this morning.  They're assholes.
It's cool.  You ain't got to apologize for your brothers.  They're big boys.
What??  So you snuck in my room to tell me that?
Okay.
Hurry up; today is Fri-day!  And we gotta hit the high-way!
Smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
Why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
I saw it.
Come on.
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
You damn right that's the big one.
Damn nigga, don't Jack the joint.  I didn't even pass it.
Sorry, dude.
...and some rolling papers, that's it. We didn't mean to mess up y'all get together or nothing.  How y'all doing?
Bite his ear!
Okay, later, bro.  Hey, Craig, nice smokin' wit'cha.
What?!
What urgent message?
Keep pushing.
I don't know.
Hey!  I said I'll take your fuckin' ass later.  Now get out of here.  You're scaring our company.
Nothing.  What you want?
Take your car.
Yeah, and hurry up.
Suga.  Go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
Come on, baby, let's go in the house.
I really don't know. I don't live there. I was just visiting...a grave.
Its'...ah...about my daughter....
I...
And your husband works for somebody else.
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
Believe me, I don't blame you.  This is the Governor, Lynn. Say hello.
Same to you.
She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here.
At one thirty my little girl is dead.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
What are you going to do about it, shoot me?
I'm tired. I want to.go now.
I promise.
Keep it.
Keep it.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What are you supposed to do?
No way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
It's already done. I've already done it. You have to pay me now.
I see. Where is this gun?
Everybody does?
Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all.
I'm not a big girl but I'm not a baby.
It better be.
Put her on.
Yes, Dad.
Tell you why I ask -- your step-pa being' a Preacher an' all...
She went.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Yeah, and ornerier than the rest.
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
Don't need no soap. I'm boilin' down the fat from my hog.
How do you mean?
A man of the Cloth?
She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
Why?
Dead.
Kings! Why, honey, there was only one.
I mind you said there was two.
It -- she --
What's that you're playing with, boy?
In the cellar. Buried under a stone in the floor.
Can I have milk too?
Ahh!
She turned me out of the bed.
Well, John, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
Oh, I'm sorry, Harry! I didn't know! I thought maybe --
How'do.
It was with this left hand that old brother Cain struck the blow that laid his brother low --
What are you after them for?
I'm givin' you to the count of three to get out that screen door; then I'm a-comin' across this kitchen shootin'!
I sure as hell hope so.
Not to worry. No signs of pathology in Nancy's EEG or pulse rate. I'd guess what we've got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
She's entering deep sleep now. Heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she's nicely relaxed. All normal. She could dream at any time now.  Right now she's like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. Waiting to see what shows up.
Because he was scary, that's why.
Not really.
Okay, okay.  I think.
Shhh. Now listen, here's what we're gonna do...
Used to. Not anymore.
Yeah.
You do?
I can save you the trouble. You're nutty as a fruitcake. I love you anyway.
What!?
Meanwhile whatever you do don't fall asleep. Midnight.
You don't know he did it.
Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?
How you know that?
Like Rod Lane?
Maybe you don't think murder's serious --
Right home after. See you.
It happens all the time.  I've got some warm milk all ready for you. Why don't you jump into bed?  I'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. C'mon, now. 
Yes, Mother. G'night.
Did you ask Daddy to have the hat examined?
I threw that filthy thing away -- I don't know what you're trying to prove with it, but --
Just wanted to protect you, Nan. Just wanted to protect you...
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Well then how can you say somebody else was there?
It's from Paris.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
You should. I'll show you.
Just for the honeymoon.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Café de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
No, that's bad management.
Monsieur.
Well, gentlemen, I'm afraid our rates are rather high.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Shall we tell her?
Oh, yes, yes.
Go to bed.
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
What is it, my boy?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Just a moment.  I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... Well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
I'm sorry, sir, but I must insist.
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice. 
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Gladly.
How long do we have to wait here?
You might hold this for me.
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
Suppress it.
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
Your type will soon be extinct.
So that is your house?
Please don't misunderstand me...
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
Is that customary?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
And what do you do for mankind?
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Thank you.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
No.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
All right, we'll make it red.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
Yes... a kiss... salute!
All right.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
But I can throw it out of the window.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
Is this your new dress suit?
All right, I'll listen.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
That depends on the tip.
Yes, it does.
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, there's Pruniers if you care for seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there's...
No, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our beloved Czar... I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... I still see you bending before His Majesty... You wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
So ... let's go ...
No.  His office.  I want a very private conversation.  I don't want to be bugged.
Then his office will be fine.
"Ex-CIA"?  There's no such thing as "ex-CIA," John -- they're all Ivy League Establishment.  Is he one of these guys with a beef against us?
He says if he doesn't get it right away, he's going to blow us out of the water.  And he means it.  Ever since his wife died in the plane crash, he's been over the edge.
We could get a million dollars.  We could get it in cash.  I know where it could be gotten.
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
That's not the question, John.  The question is: Why is he paying?
John, sooner or later -- sooner, I think -- you are going to learn the lesson that has been learned by everyone who has ever gotten close to Richard Nixon.  That he's the darkness reaching out for the darkness.  And eventually, it's either you or him. Look at the landscape of his life and you'll see a boneyard.
Yeah?
Christ, we created Frankenstein with those fucking Cubans.
Uh, we've never done this before, sir ... How do we pay?  In ... hundreds?  Do you fill a black bag full of unmarked bills?
No, sir.
Why not?
I will not go down as the first American president to lose a war! Going into Cambodia, bombing Hanoi, bombing Laos -- it buys us time so we can get out and give the South Vietnamese a fighting chance.
Yeah, good old Spiro.  Well, better him than me.  What the hell is he but an insurance policy?
Looks like he talked to Joe Kraft ... and to the Times.  Told them he was dead set against the bombing, that you were ... "unstable."  Claims he has to handle you "with kid gloves" ...
Sir, Bob and I are gonna have to testify before Earvin's committee.
Executive privilege will make it look like we're covering up.
Mr. Hoover was a realist.
Not like the others -- Dean, McCord, the rest ... We never got our side of the story out, Al.  People've forgotten.  I mean: "Fuck you, Mr. President, fuck you Tricia, fuck you Julie!" and all that shit, just words, but what violence!  The tear gassing, the riots, burning the draft cards, Black Panthers -- we fixed it, Al, and they hate me for it -- the double dealing bastards.  They lionize that traitor, Ellsberg, for stealing secrets, but they jump all over me 'cause it's Nixon.  ... They've always hated Nixon.
Damn right.  And there's still a helluva lotta people out there who wanna believe ... That's the point, isn't it?  They wanna believe in the President.
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
I don't know anything about that.
We'll work on it.  I say we cut ourselves loose from these clowns and that's all there is to it.
No, keep Trini out of this. Chotiner's too old.  And for God's sake, keep Colson out.  It's time to baptize our young counsel.  That means Dean can never talk about it.  Attorney-client privilege.  Get to it.  And Dean -- you stay close on this.
All right.
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
I'll talk to Helms.  Oh, Pat asked if you're coming to the Residence for dinner tonight.
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
You never told him?
These kids are being manipulated by the Communists.  Like Chambers and Hiss.
Probably flunking, nothing to do except come down here and meet girls. Henry's out there with them.
The presidency won't protect us, Bob. We're beyond politics now ...
How?
For God's sake, when does this end?!
It's meant to make us stronger.  Thou art stronger than Harold ... stronger than Arthur.  God has chosen thee to survive ...
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
My friends call me "Mister President."
And so shall I.  Arrange some coffee, would you General Cushman?
I didn't choose him as my deputy, Mr. President.  You did.
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Yes ... It involves some old and forgotten papers.  Things I signed as Vice President.  I want the originals in my office and I don't want copies anywhere else.
So President Kennedy thought.
No.  They make me sick.  They smell like death ... I had two brothers die young.  But let me tell you, there are worse things than death.  There is such a thing as evil.
You must be familiar with my favorite poem by Yeats?  "The Second Coming"?
Who do you think is behind it?
Injections.  Even this noble sport's been fixed.  Seen the guys?
The White House.
We're gonna be plumbers, Frank.  We're gonna plug a leak.
Only if Kennedy dumps Johnson.
Well, goddamn.  Are you threatening me, Dick?
There's no other choice.
Churchill, DeGaulle, Disraeli.  They all went through the pain of losing power.
Yes.  My mother used to pray ... a lot.  It's been a long time since I really prayed.  Let's pray, Henry; let's pray a little.
You don't think he was a hero?
Yes.
We know you've taken a great risk in inviting us here.
We're gonna get rid of him -- Allende, I mean -- just as fast as we can. He's on the top of the list.
You know, this kinda thing, you gotta be brutal.  A leak happens, the whole damn place should be fired.  Really. You do it like the Germans in World War II.  If they went through these towns and a sniper hit one of them, they'd line the whole goddamned town up and say: "Until you talk you're all getting shot."  I really think that's what has to be done.  I don't think you can be Mr. Nice-guy anymore ...
Make some money, Dick, prove yourself to the Wall Street crowd and let Goldwater and Rockefeller take the fall against Kennedy.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
You all know me.  I'm one of you, I grew up a stone's throw from here on a little lemon ranch in Yorba Linda ...
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
The hell with 'em.
What I know about this country, I ... I could rip it apart.  If they want a public humiliation, that's what they'll get.  But I will never resign this office.  Where the fuck am I?
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
Maybe I should get out of the game. What do you think, Buddy?  Go back to being a lawyer and end up with something solid, some money at the end of the line ... You know, I keep thinking of my old man tonight.  He was a failure, too.
The girls will grow up.  They only know you from television anyway.
Then call him.  I'm sure it was an oversight.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together?  Just the two of us.
Then what are you scared of, honey?
And what am I doing?
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
You know: how the voters are gonna play your divorce.
No ID in her room?
I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry.
Try "old" on for size.
Yes ma'am, I do.
No.
Gun out and up.
Wasn't no bullet.
Okay.
Yessir.
It is a car afire. But Wendell said there was something back country too.
I mean, would you care to join me.
I didn't see my Prednizone.
No.
It's full a money.
I need to know that.
That'll work.
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
I need dark. To get it. I know where it is.
Did you not hear me? We can't give out no information.
Step out of the car please, sir.
You from around here?
All right.
This. And the gas.
Didn't mean nothin'.
You already asked me that.
Well... I need to see about closin'.
You live in that house behind the store?
Sir?
The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss.
For what?
What do you want to know?
I'd just like to know your opinion of him. In general. Just how dangerous is he?
Can I get my parking ticket validated?
Goodbye, Mr. Wells.
The what?
Another additional.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
Not that way.
What product.
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
A woman can write a check.
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
"Banners?"
Great. Good. Content...
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
...I... I know what you are.
Do you know why I'm here?
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think?  You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
This is really awkward...
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted...  I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
I gotta go make dinner.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
Do what?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
You told me that two hours ago.
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
Yes... maybe it was.
Ad lib?
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
David, please --
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
I married a car salesman.
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
How many men have I talked to?
Who?
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Where are you going?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
No, that should be more than --
Ahh... my wife's.
I don't follow...
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours.  So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
What?
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
Wesley...
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
No... she just wanted something outta life. Anything. And with Del, she wasn't getting nothing. That's her husband, Del. I'm sorry about what happened and all, but that's the way I feel about all of this...
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?  Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
What the hell's going on?
No! No problem, there is no...  What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
No! Let me try this!
Damn, that's sweet...  She really that good-looking in person?
Better.
David Ravell.
"A Reason to Love."
Gopher, Everett?
Yeah, let's negotiate 'em, Everett.
And no transmission belt for two weeks neither.
Oh my God!
Is the marriage off then, Miz Wharvey?
Gonna pluck us off the tit.
Latch right on to that tit.
Suckin' away.
Well now, I don't believe assa property scription.
Not out the other side his face, though.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
I can and I am and I will - tomorrow! I gotta think about the little Wharvey gals! They look to me for answers! Vernon can s'port 'em and buy 'em lessons on the clarinet! The only good thing you ever did for the gals was get his by that train!
Just a little change of cast. Me and the little lady are gonna pick up the pieces'n retie the knot, mixaphorically speakin'. You boys're invited, of course. Hell, you're best men! Already got the rings.
Or, it might a been under the mattress.
We got but four days to get to that treasure! After that, it'll be at the bottom of a lake!
For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
But... but...
I am. Hur you?
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
Yeah, I know.
Don't lose any sleep over it. I wouldn't mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
I don't mean anything by it.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
I'm doing okay, sir.
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
Yes, sir!
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Aw screw it...
Well, goodbye.
Pardon?
I didn't call you anything before that.
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
No, sir.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
I sure remember Tommy.  Mind if we talked about something else?
Then, I'll see you around.
I'm a little late, that's all.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
One more minute.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No. I never feel like that.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
I'm starving.
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
No, they're for your mom.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Who's got two bucks? It's costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old Lady and my kids in that motel.
I've seen better.
A woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
She didn't.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Make her come out.  And when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  She can't get out of this house.  She can't even think she can get out of this house.  We just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  And I don't want  Joe Pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  That's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in Greenhaven.  So we're gonna seal the place up.  They wanna hole up in here?  Fine, we'll help 'em.  Make it impossible for them to leave.  Once they come out of that room.
That's right.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
You got an idea?
Yeah.  She can.  She's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. You rest, Kid.  Half an hour.
It's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  Look, look, look, she's telling us.
Fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  They shouldn't be here for another week!  They don't own this house yet!
Daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  We're okay, here.  We can do this, right?
A guy shows you a gun, Burnham, and you insult him?  Hey, who's the idiot?  Huh?
Where did you get this clown?
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
What tables?  I've never seen him before.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
We're trying to scare them, not kill them!
Junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
And we're never getting in.
Close?  Are you insane?  We're nowhere near close!  Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit.  Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
Lookin' doubtful there, Big Guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
Yeah, whatever.
Everything okay?
KID!  NO ELEVATOR!
That's right, Raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, I found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  Me, me, me, I, I, I, at no point did I say "you" or Raoul," got it?
He puts his hands on me again I'll bury a slug in his ear.
Could you slow down a little?  Or we could wait for the car...
The crowd goes wild.
They can't.  They can't get in here. No.  They can't.
To prove he wasn't chicken.
I am.  I'm here.
Come on, come on...
Uh uh.
What would you think, in the middle of the night?  I mean, three what, three bears?  He'll call the police.
He --
I'm dizzy and thirsty.
I'm sorry, Mom.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
You know that's bullshit.
Man, fuck you!!!
Look this is bull...
I hear you. I'll catch you in a bit. Feeling cooped up in there, you know?
Can you make a deal with them?
That would be an excellent start.  Tell him to keep a low profile.
Jesus...
As far as Mr. Hoover is concerned the worst has happened, the Panthers have unified with other organizations -- most likely sponsored by communists -- to undermine the war in Vietnam.  By doing so, they have quite simply guaranteed their own extinction.
Again I'll take the fifth amendment on that question.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
Yeah.
You know, you're lucky to be back. Most niggers die on the front lines. Seems like that's what they're there for.
I'm talking about survival. Yours, mine, all of it. Outside and in. You got to do something for me. Staying alive might depend on it. The pigs are gonna try to infiltrate us and we're gonna let 'em. But their spy's gonna be our spy too. How about it?
But nothing... you do live here don't you?
Just the legit shit.
I don't know.  But I'm sure I'll find out. Rose, you did me solid.
Ain't no one seen him.
Why didn't you tell me?
You don't even know it man, but you're a god damn hero.
We've got plenty of baking powder. You went to Pembroke and got five pounds two weeks ago.
I said, I'm not my sister.
Yes, sir.
That one is a bit more difficult.
Yes, sir.
Anything about the convention in Philadelphia?
It's already over.
It's safer if we stay together.
You know how old I am.
She got me at a more impressionable age.
She said that?  Oh, my Lord, she said that?
Seven homes along the Black River so far...
I know he did and he's sorry.  He'll come back as soon as he can.
That's a damn long time...
Name five hundred.
... time, royal succession, regicide, bribery...
Thank you.
Last anyone saw, riding hard, northeast, his staff a hundred yards behind, trying to catch up.
Who's in command?
I am, I think.
When?
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Goodbye, Harry.
Thank you.  Maybe all of this will buy him some peace.
But what about Thomas?
Earned.
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
God willing.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Yes--
Yaay!
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yayyy!
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
Oh, faith's a little more than just believing.
Well, here we are, sitting in my chair. Do you think my chair will be here tomorrow?
Then you have faith in that. But we don't know it will be; after all, some crazed chair-burglar might break in while we're away and steal it, right?
I think it is so, Ellie.
Church? Oh. Oh, Jesus.
But--
Ayuh.
The Micmac Indians. I brought you here to bury Ellen's cat.
No. I'm a doctor. I know death when I see it, and Church was dead. He smells horrible and he uses his claws, but he's alive...and I feel like I'm going crazy. It was that place, wasn't it?
Wendigo?
Why, then, things should be fine.
She got used to the idea. Spot lived another four years. He died peacefully in the night that second time, and I buried him in the Pet Sematary...where his bones still lie.
Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
You don't understand--
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
She was a little over-excited, that's all. Poor kid.
Oh, you're welcome. Only if some- thing should go wrong while he's under the gas--it's a one-in-a-thousand shot, but it happens--you explain to her.
We got that part.  Anything else?
You left me on a desert island -- what worse can you do?
Aye.  See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do?  Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue?  The Dauntless a first- rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas.  But if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl?
Now.  No, don't kill him.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Captain Barbossa ... I have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against Port Royal.
Now, none of that.  Please dig in.
It's a piece of the treasure of Isla de Muerta.
You're speaking up for him again?
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I know where your heart truly lies.
Yes, father.
It would appear, so do you.
Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request.
So that's it?  That's the secret grand adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow?  You spent three days on the beach drinking rum?
You're right.  Here's luck to you, Will Turner.
What?  What was that?  Something funny, Miss Swann? Share, please.
I have a plan.  If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided.
That we are.
Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
This must be some important boat.
That so?  I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, neigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl?
Captain Jack Sparrow.  If you please.
Ah, but you have heard of me.
You would do that?
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
And you want to turn pirate yourself?
I helped build these cells.  Those are hook-and-ring hinges.  The proper application of strength, the door'll lift free.  Just calls for the right lever and fulcrum ...
Good.
So's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start.  My advice -- smile and enjoy it.
Aye!  Avast!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
Good man.  Good pirate.  And clever -- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin.
My father -- was not -- a pirate!
The pistol.  When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot.  No good for hunting, or surviving, really.  But after three weeks of starvation and thrist -- the option of that pistol begins to look good.
Depends.
Jack!
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
The worst.  On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants.  Now that's a great pirate.
You've seen it?
Yes, I have.
But I've seen a ship with black sails.
But --
Until he's done.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period.  There will be no way to stop it.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
I ask you what is the purpose of science?  What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to understand them all?  To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If science is simply a means, what then is the end?
Do?  Well, I suppose that depends on you.
Maybe you should, but you can't.
No.  I'm getting used to it.
Who cares!  We've got to find him! Hurry!
Based on what we know of him, that would seem inevitable.
Then you still love me?
I like Trix!
I'll do whatever I have to do.
What I've always done.  As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
Because I am a new man, Susan.  I am a man of vision.  Your problem, Susan, is that you're always looking down.  If you'd just look up you'd see the big picture and in the big picture men of vision do not dwell on what might be lost.  They focus on what can be gained.
You're afraid of him.
Been out for six months now.
And for cleaning up oil spills.
I can't help it, Suze.  It's this place.  You know how I get in these stores.  They freak me out.  All these tiny boxes, little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
What happens?
That's right.
Isn't it already too late then?
Means?  Oh no.  We won't know what it means until the end of the story and maybe then it won't seem quite as funny to you, Doctor Frankenstein!
And I don't see you sunbathing at Chernobyl!
Do you have something to bring me down?
Something else I want to try.
I can't go back to jail.  I gotta get out of here.
I didn't know what was going to happen.  I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I'm not leaving without you, Susan!
Did you think I could just leave you...?
Oh yes you are!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
We lost him.
He believes that the second nanobot should be ready for testing by now.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
Yes - isn't it.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance—
For what?
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and — 
You don't wear garters!
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
That's ridiculous.
Oh, shut up!
Oh, hello Mother!
Well, I got a seat, but I have no place to put it.
Thanks, I will.
Yale '21, I believe.
Why, sure. It's a lotta hooey.
Oh boy, I'd love it.
I'll bite. What's the catch?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see.  Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Yes, sir.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
A what?
My play.
No?
No!
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
Oh no, sir!
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
I hope you'll be very happy.
My error.
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before.  It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
Yes - and I'd love it.
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
No.
Well, at best you might deny it.
I suppose you know why I came—?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
They've been ready for the last half hour.
I have. Double-strength!
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Anne Schuyler, are you going to sit there and watch this man insult us? Haven't you any decency left?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, sir, I putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
Thanks. I thought you weren't gonna ...
I had to say goodbye.
Yes she is.
Oh darling that's wonderful!  I always knew you could do it.
Where are you gonna go?
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
You want to get out of here?
What?
Lover's Lane!
So.
What's the matter?
I don't know what I'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
No it couldn't!
Oh, no thanks ...
... How?
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
You're not allowed to lie.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
Well great. The Pleasantville Marathon starts at six thirty.
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
What's going to happen?
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
They don't notice that kind of thing.
Not directly anyhow ...
Wow.
I told you. I'm like positive.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
Yeah ... Sort of ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
Oh, I know they're not. But I mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
Oh. I'm sorry--refresh my memory. What episode does the orgy happen in, again?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
You're not going anywhere. You're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody HAPPY AGAIN!!!
Why?
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
Yeah ...
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I'm fine. I just ... Had to get home early.
There aren't any cheeseburgers.
What are you talking about! You make hamburgers! That is the point!
I think you should try not to think about this anymore.
Yeah.
No, that's not it.
Remember the one where Bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
Yeah. 
Cool.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
Yes, I'll be there.
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Hello.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
...please, I just don't want it....
I know.
Yeah I can't.
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
This is Georgia.
Hi. This is Jack.
Are your pants off?
Really?
You have a girlfriend?
Yeah....do you do well, do you make alotta money?
So.....are you stroking it, yet, honey?
Yes.
Me?
I know but I....how much is it?
Like seven-fifty. Seven hundred fifty?
....what....?
I was wondering if it's better to ask your girlfriend for the money? It could be really easy. I mean, I have all your information, credit card information and billing stuff --
We got disconnected before....
I know I did. But I don't.
You lied to me?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
Yeah.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
That's nice. It's nice.  I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
....yeah....
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
Ok. Have a good trip.
Yeah.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
Ok. Where are you from originally?
Yeah......yeah.....
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
...what...?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
Yes I'm sorry.
It's a plastic, yeah.
Ok.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
Well who did?
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
Hi, is this your first time calling?
......and this is confidential?
CALM DOWN SHUT THE FUCK UP AND CALM DOWN SHUT SHUT SHUT UP SHUT UP --
We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
I think you have a call?
How's business?
Mhm.
Like a psychiatrist?
Fine, thank you.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
....yes.....
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
Wait a minute --
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
What is this, man?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
Yes I am.
What are you doing?
You can't be late.
I won't.
Seriously.
I'll see you there.
I thought Latisha said you would --
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Nothing.
Put him through.
Shut up, just put him on the phone, it doesn't matter, just shut up --
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
It's not bad, it's ok.
Are you coming to eat with us?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
I'll just see you when you get back here.
Ok.
No one's forcing you to listen.
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Mustn't do that, sir.
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
Mightier than the sword indeed.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
A man after my own heart...
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I saw the longing in your eye --
It's a formality; truly.
Do you favor its publication?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
He's sworn to obedience.
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
Yes?
Was ever a man more risquè? He wants to take me every way!
And then -- to prove your truly mine -- I'll plunder you, darling, from behind!
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
What's that then?
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
Go on, child.
Tell him -- if he uncovers our whereabouts -- you'll slit your wrists with a razor, and I'll plunge a hat- pin through my heart.
No. But tell him I would.
What thought is that?
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
Do you?
Elegant words, sir, when you have made your name and your fortune on slander and innuendo and gossip. In your papers you taught the world how to look under every rock. I learned at the knee of the master.
So where does that leave us, Mr. Welles? What kind of sad future are we two making? A future where men will do anything to sell their newspapers and their movies? A future where no price is too high for fame and power? When we will all scratch each other to pieces just to be heard?
Don't
How much?
You needn't use that language with me
Sir? 
Who the hell wants to see life?! People are sick to death of life! They want make-believe, pal. Fantasy. They want Tarzan and Jane, not Tristan and Isolde.
That's better than being the oldest has-been in Hollywood history.
You're a laugh-riot, kid.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
The great Spanish bullfighter
The old man has his own way of doing things
He's nothing but a hypocrite. He preaches morality every day in his sordid little papers for everyone else in the world but he lives openly with his mistress.
When I was a kid I wanted to scorch the world too - - I had all kinda dreams about making great pictures and telling great stories. But all that's finished for me--
I can't do it. okay?! I drink too much -- I drink all the fucking time and I don't have it anymore. All that is over for me--
Why her?
Yeah, but the margins are real wide.
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
To my invaluable comrade Drink up!
No she's not. Don't you get it, ya lunk? She's using code language to the studio bosses. "Bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees" -- who the hell do you think she's talking about?
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
Oh God.
It's the safe bet, Orson. There's nothing wrong with that.
That soulless monster gets no tears from me.
It was fun, wasn't it?
Five...? Yes. No. We're done today
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
About what?
I don't run the joint. They just told me to bring you in.
You just take it easy, now. You'll do all right. Feelin' Ok?
You were a big favorite in this fight. Then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Yeah, I really cleaned up on him.
Where's your wife, Jake?
Jack! Enough!
Go ahead.
Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
How many times do I have to hit her? I hit her enough.
Give me a chance. Let me look.
Jack, if there was anything funny, I would tell you.
C'mon, Joey.
G'wan, do it.  Protect yourself, rummy.
Well, that's what I mean.
Eh, Joey, even you don't know what you meant. You mentioned Salvy, Tommy Como, you -- that means somethin'. Why'd you say them? You coulda said anybody.
I don't mean now. I mean before -- before we met.
Just give it a nice little tap.
Come over here.
Who asked you?
No, I'm not.
Yeah, what?
Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
What's that kissing on the mouth shit?
What do I have to do to get a straight answer around here.
I don't know what it is. I dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
Are you drunk?
All right, just don't make any noise.
Tony Janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
Joey, relax. You're taking this the wrong way. Why don't you sit down and have a drink?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
Oh. When are they expected home?
Name me a better photographer.
But his leg!
You think I made all this up?
His wife took a trip.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
Thanks.
I was jaywalking.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
Not yet.
If possible -- both.
I can't do that.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
I told you that --
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Next time, have some good news.
Okay. Indo-China. Tuesday. We'll pick you up.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
I don't know what you mean.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
She expects me to marry her.
She's only perfect.
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
I was.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
In this heat?  They're up now.
You called the police?
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You haven't even heard from him?
He knows.  Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
Without any future?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
To get on home.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Still -- those witnesses.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
A new disease.
I'm glad they let you out.
You watch too much television.
Chicken?
Somebody find him a knife.
Buzz Gundersen.
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
And you dropped it?
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  Would you do it?
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
I think I know my son.
Did anyone see you there?  I mean did they get your license number or anything?
He's home.  I heard the car.
You remember me?
Plato.  It's a nickname.
Who has?
Everybody!  Crunch and Goon and everybody!  I think they're going to kill you.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
Why?
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Mom--I'm not--
Good Lord!
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom.  Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away.  Dad?
They never do.
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Okay--
Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now?
Listen--
Bully for you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See, I'm new.
You going there?
Neither can I.
No.
I'm never going back.
No--come on.  Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
See, we're very modern.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Hi.
Why?
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
You don't need to do that.
You disappointed?
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Okay.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
We were romantic then too--
Don't hurt him...
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
...whoever she is.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
I don't think it's negative five.
Saw me --
What.
No, c'mon --
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
Ashley. We're not going anywhere I used to work.
NICK!
You're not hearing me here --
I love you!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick...
...Haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
You saved me.
What?
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
No, you can't --
The hell I can't.
Yes!
So you could get down her chimney.
A girl says she loves you, you say something.
What's her greatest fear?
No. It's her brother.
This isn't the Tomahawk.
More than you know.
Might as well be.
Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place.
Monster. If we're working together here, we gotta be working together. I can't walk in there looking like the Lone Fucking Ranger with ten bucks to throw down. You don't want me getting noticed, right? Not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
...never... tried...
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY?
You need six.
No.
There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat.
That part, Nick... was planned out the day I read your letters.
Not cowboys, Nick. Not cowboys.
How'd you know my name.
And where they hide the real money.
We want to see our casino making money again, Mr. Bangs. Making money for our community.
And Monster... he was talking with the casino manager. Nick was talking to him.
Somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
No, the place. The remodeling. moving everything around.
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
I promise you, I didn't know!
Yeah.
Fuck your hot chocolate, Rudy.
Me and her got a connection.  Read this part. Read the part about stuffing her stocking.
Shoulda written to that magazine, Rudy. I'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. Not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. You? You're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. Searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
I don't know, I've seen the business world.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
GUARD!!!
That was my king!
A snake charmer, what the fuck d'you think. I'll call a doctor, take care of him, fix 'm right up. No, where's Mr. Brown and Mr. Blue?
No. She was from Ladora Heights.
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
Well, let's go get it. We also gotta get rid of all those cars. It looks like Sam's hot car lot outside.  You stay here and babysit Orange and the cop.  You two take a car each, I'll follow ya. You ditch it, I'll pick you up, then we'll pick up the stones. And while I'm following you, I'll arrange for some sort of a doctor for our friend.
How can you tell?
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
It's a amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
It's like a joke. You remember what's important, and the rest you make your own. The only way to make it your own is to keep sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it, and sayin' it.
Take a seat.
Fuckin' asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.
You're not Mr. Purple, somebody from another job's Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink.
He's doin' twenty years in Susanville.
Two minutes, tops. It's a tough two minutes. It's daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
Around twenty. Security pretty lax. They almost always just deal in boxes. Rough uncut stones they get from the syndicate. On a certain day this wholesaler's gettin' a big shipment of polished stones from Israel. They're like a way station. They are gonna get picked up the next day and sent to Vermont.
I'm not askin', I'm betting.
You didn't ask.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
Uh-uh. I don't tip.
You don't believe in tipping?
Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin' time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
Goddamn, goddamn! How did he die?
Let's go in the other room...
What's wrong with it?
You're right, this is bad.  How did you get out?
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
For all I know, you're the rat.
That fuckin did it!
This place just ain't secure anymore. We're leaving, and you should go with us.
Look of things, she doesn't.
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Hurry up.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
I don't want to run short.
At the ranch maybe?
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
Good thing you didn't.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
All right, you didn't know.
I'm sorry. Let's go.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
Then why stay in the hills.
Plenty more.  And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
Maybe in Sonora.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
What are you waiting for? Do something.
I don't care what he thinks.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
Would they be good to eat?
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
I was doin' both. Here.
Let me do that.
Alex, what are you doing?
Shut up, you slut. You think you can take him from me? Well, over my dead body.
Uh, Alex, we've only know each other one day.
Now, why that bitch gotta bring that shit this way? I hope she didn't see me.
What?! What is it, a monster?!
Okay.
Yes, I feel their spirits. Cora... Keaton... I am here to communicate...
No, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, Uriah Bloodworth.
Ray, have you been here all this time?
Oh, I'm fine... just clowning around.
He's so brave.
Open chest!!!
Shhh!
Her hair doesn't have as many split ends at yours. Her skin isn't as oily as yours, either. Also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have Down's Syndrome or something. Otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
It looks like the furnace.
Oh, Buddy, I was thinking the same thing. It might be our last night in this house. And I think we should take full advantage of it.
Huh?
Shit!
Listen to me I --
Listen to me I --
Oh.
She killed herself a week before he died.
It's okay.
Yeah, they're so warm and soft.
Don't worry Cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
Yes, it was me all along. I killed Hugh Kane and his mistress.
I'll go.
Alright, let's take a vote...
No, my friends are right here!
Soon, but first I must bless this house.
I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
Professor, you guys gotta see this. Dwight, come here.
Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
Saw who?!
As I am sure you are aware, Professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I've given them special consideration.
How are we going to get them all up there?
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
No, they're just powder burns, thank God. They were empty. Get her upstairs.
The force in this house is far greater than I anticipated. In one night I recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the E.U.P. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
Yeah, I can see that. Later I want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
I'm the caretaker, not the handyman.  Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
My help?
Father, come in, please.
Soon. First, I must bless this house.
What?
Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
Shorty, why don't you say grace?
"Fucked me."
"Fucked me."
This is so cool! It's just like a horror movie.
Why?
Because it's the rules!
Let me see!
Surely you don't think Beverly was involved!
Hey, I'm late for work. Bye, honey. 
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
I love that you're my wife.
Oohhhhh! Yeah! Yeah!
Yes, I did.
I can't say it out loud. I don't use bad language.
Listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
GODDAMN YOU!
I didn't do it!
Let the record show I'm just standing here.
Don't say words unless you mean them, Misty. 
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
You want me to keep that under the table for you?
Yes... but... I didn't...
He's a good boy.
Certainly not!
You forgot something...
Yes you are.
From what I understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
You can?
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
Let's get out of here.
If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her.  People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
I ought to know.
She showed me a drawing.
You	fool! That symbol is us -- us. She was asking about us.
But I'd give a great deal to know.
Afraid she might commit suicide?  People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact -— I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.  There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her —— to see her —— to touch her —— in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.
Good.
He was a kind little man in his way —— and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
The people at the restaurant?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
Don't be ridiculous. For months I've had the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
I went as a detective. I found out that Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
It's because of Jacqueline —— I can't go on looking for her --
Who was the first one -- Mrs. Redi?
No, not at all, Mr. Jason.
One believes -— it's like any other religion...
Unless what?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted -- but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.
No, she's with her sister,
I'm afraid not.
Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
I doubt if you'll get anything out of that woman. But if  you'd like to try, I'll advance you the money to make the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don't find your sister, you can always come back here.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Why
What?
Oh. Well, please sit down.
Yes.
Curious.
You play an instrument?
Exactly. I would say the fact that you feel the first year of your marriage has gone by quickly means lots of things. Or could mean lots of things.
How long has it been since you've seen John?
Why is that?
Do you want me to?
Not usually. I mean, honestly, I haven't known many guys that could think straight with an erection, so I feel I'm way ahead of the game as far as being clear-headed goes.
They are looking at you. Ann, you are truly breathtaking. I don't know if you understand how your appearance can affect people. Men want to possess you, women wish they looked like you. And those that don't or can't resent you. And the fact that you're a nice person just makes it worse.
Oh, see, I meant someone you've had sex with. That's part of the theory.
What kind of personal project?
Yes.
Load a new tape, turn the camera on.
You said you weren't always impotent.
Yes. I did. Willfully and repeatedly.
If you do get out of your marriage, will you continue to be inhibited?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
But you're planning to be?
I don't know. Possibly.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
I'm okay. It's okay.
Are you going to see Elizabeth while you're here?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Well, are you?
No, I'm not. Frankly, I'm offended at the accusation.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
Loud.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Why?
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
Did you confront John about the visitor?
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
But he won't.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Because I wanted to.
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
You want me to leave?
How did you find me?
About what?
Sex. Your sexual history, your sexual preferences.
And that's all?
And you ask questions, right?
No.
Do I sit or stand?
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
Live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?
Do you like the way I look?
He doesn't have to tell me.
Hi.
I'd like to make another tape.
I can't talk you into it?
No. You'll have to get somebody else.
Cynthia, I don't know.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
Cynthia, I don't think you want to, I mean, you should see the way he dresses. I really think he's in a bad way.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
What's so stupid about it?
What if this tape gets into the wrong hands?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
No.
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
It'll just be me.
A bonfire, probably.
What do you mean?
Anyway, I've always said, the work is the thing. I can be happy without a marriage, but take away my work, that's different. And if Ann can't handle that, that's her problem, like we re all alone in this world, you know what I'm saying? I mean, fuck.  Jesus, what's takin' this guy?
Yes?
Okay, in a minute, I'm on with a client.
Buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
With some milk jugs I just happened to pick up on the way home.
Sure.
OK. But late.
OK. I'll meet you back there. Don't leave until I get there. Lock the door and don't open it except for me. OK?
Oh, but the nurse, she went away. I think she must go to look for you.
Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
Used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  Cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
You touch my spleen, Rollo.  And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
Of course.
Nothing.  Just...memories!
It's no use pussyfooting around, Janet -- we have to cut quick and deep.
Home?
Jah -- you endorse his product -- He endorses your research.
So it seems.
Farley is already a TV winner as we shall see.  Dentonvile will run forever now that his interest has embraced mental hygiene.
Overreact!  You're the one with theories about conspirac...  Oliver?
Yes.  Macabre, isn't it.  The blind leading the blind.
We've got to, Brad, everyone's watching.
I'M LOOKING FOR TRADE
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
YOU LOST YOUR BABY WHEN YOU LOST YOUR BALLS YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND, YOU'VE LOST YOUR GRIP SO SAY BYE-BYE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR IMPROVEMENT
Too flashy...they'll clash with the new outfits.
Of course.
Oh.  Mom.  It's Brad.
It's...
What show?
Thank God he was born an orphan. It would have killed his parents.
Why?
Oh, Mac ran up this little crowd-pleaser.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
Don't worry, Janet.  Brad'll probably get just what he needs.
Good!  Well there's still hope. Lots of hope.
F for...
F for...
YOU KEEP GOING BACK IT'S DRIVING YOU INSANE
I liked it when you caught me fucking him.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Bye.
And... they're passing. Conundrum's passing. He said they really liked it. They really wanted to do it, but they just couldn't figure out how to market it. He said it was a tough call.
Is it chicken?
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
Nice.
Sure I know Maya. Real well.
Maybe. Recognize this?
Well, in that case...
What?
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good.  This is the new one, right, Chris?
We should have driven.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
Pour us a couple.
Sure I know Maya.
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Huh.
Slaughterhouse.
I know what you need.
What's up?
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
That's thoughtful.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
Please, Miles, please.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
You said it looked like a car accident.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Sure.
Oh yeah? How is it?
She got anything good?
Yeah, same here.
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Miles?
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
We were thinking. Why don't we go back to my place? I've got wine, some insane cheeses, music, whatever.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Where?
Just now. She's thrilled. And the kids.
Right.
She doesn't answer me either.
I don't feel much.
It doesn't sound natural when I curse.
What does it matter then?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. Your grandma said, "No." He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.
They think over a hundred thousand. They're just estimates.  But we held strong.
How do they know it's over?
Listen, there's things I can take and a couple things I can't and one of them I can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in things. I saw your eyes last night.  I don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? I'm serious.
Yes. They would invade us using only ground tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
We'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
Now we're talking.  How about you Merrill?
What's that?
Don't call me Father. It's just Graham now.
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
He definitely wasn't a midget.
No.
You'll lose the signal!
They'll find a way in.
That's why they got you in jail?
Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
It was my fault.
Where's Jake?
Goodbye?
It's one thing to know it...
How's Mr. Parker doing?
I'm afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name isn't Baxter, and he ain't Hawley.
I want you out of town before the hanging.
You got no idea what they were after?
I gotta stop by Turley and meet a guy.
No hard feelings.
All right, you buy me a drink.
All I'm saying is, you won't trip over me if you look her up.
Pleased to meet you, Sheriff.
What happened?
They run me off. They burned me out. They made it so I couldn't do. Just like Georgia. If you won't sell, they take it anyway.
The other guy drew first.
All I did was kiss the girl.
Really?
This nigger's breaking up my place, Sheriff Langston.
It's been a while.
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
What's she got to do with it?
Not a thing. She's just a mutual friend.  But if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she's going to get hurt.
I'll drink to that. Will you join me, Miss --
Thanks. That's what I call it too.
So-called?
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
You better get in there with her until this thing is over.
I can't imagine how you ever let a man like that go.  I owe Viktor everything.
Not just any Mike & Ike's -- cherry Mike & Ike's.  Do you know why I, Viktor Taransky, two-time Academy Award nominated director --
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal.  This is business.
Why?  Because she would never show up at something like this.  She's intensely private.
I don't have it on me.  Anyway, it means a lot.  Have you read the reviews?  They're love letters.  Listen to this one.  "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
She'll drive herself.
Hair and make-up?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Viktor, I have a feeling.  One of my feelings.  There's something about her I don't trust.
Who else?  It's always Simone's idea.
Everyone you know is lying.
She said you were very beautiful.
Impossible.
No, there isn't.  There's nothing to her.
Not if I don't let her.
Who says that -- ?  -- Never mind.  You have to listen to me, Elaine.  Simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation.  I inherited it from a madman -- I can show you --
Exactly.  Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Just a minute.
So you did meet her?
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Elaine, do you realize you can't stop talking about Viktor?
... so much like her?
Is that a problem?
Who are you really?
Sure.  Where would you like to start?
Absolutely not!
Not like this --
That's the point, Hank.  No matter how good they are, they're still Mickey Mouse.  Everyone's tried. Everyone's failed.  It can't be done.
Well, I can't wait to meet Simone... what's her last name?
Really?  Who?  Where do you meet them?  In a chat room?  How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
How?
Precisely.
She thinks you're with Simone.
Lainey, you know Simone and I don't have a real relationship.
No, that was me.
Lainey...
I didn't kill anyone, Bernard, there was no one to kill!
Max Sayer -- National Echo.
I remember when the Echo had class -- the paper that could bring down governments.
It's a yacht.
I do?  Sure I do.  Can we speak off the record?  I'm a fair man.  I'm willing to sit down with her and tell her side of the story.
I wouldn't want you to compromise your ethics.
This should take care of Mother.
Obviously the name isn't real -- she's using an assumed identity, travels under a false name, checks into hotels with an alias.  She never stays in the same place two nights in a row.  Anything on the satellite photos?  What about the fingerprints?  What happened when we dusted that hotel suite?
We used to.
I don't understand.
You're in breach.
It's not the size of the role, Viktor.  Am I or am I not contractually entitled to the biggest trailer on the set?
No, of course not, you're right. That would be crazy.
Is Miss Simone coming today?
Perfect.  God, I'm so relaxed around you.
I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. What did you say?
I certainly am, Mr. Taransky.
-- What you don't understand --
... digitized.
You know what I'm talking about.
I work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.
You saw that on T.V., Cole?
How do you draw now?
You hate him?
No gas... Hey, that's good.
Your eyes told me.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Yes, I am.
You believe now?
Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.
They did?
They'd pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... People watching would spit at them.
Stop it!
'Course, it's none of my business.
What's a "little while?"
Slut.
Witch.
Keep your shirt on! I'm almost done!
Yeah. To get the hell off this farm.
Hey. Fuck you.
Shotgun. Suicide. Next?
Sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before I rolled it.
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Joseph Macdonald... Your son.
Pardon?
I'll be fine here.
I wouldn't pay Jesse no mind at all. She's just a crazy old woman. Hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  Wasn't much right before that, neither.
I bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
Look. You want to talk about this?
Wait a minute --
Don't fuck with me, Bill. Your post here as Chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
Sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
Whatcha' doin'?
I don't know. I've seen them so many times before. I guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
No. What…?
Yeah.
I can't hear when you're nodding.
Sorry.
Shit. You're kidding me. Nope. BRENDA Brenda! GRANT Hell, you were --
All the rib eyes?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
Sure you do.
When one sees you they all see you.
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
Your what?
If...?
America's bored.  Now, what do you want?
How much style?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
You just passed your nemesis.
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
You could've asked.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  I forgot your question?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
I'm begging.
That's me.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
Running blocker.
Yeah?
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
You okay?
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory.  Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Seventy-two five.  Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
About one to five years worth.
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
I don't know where he's goin' or what he's doin', but I sure hope to God he makes it.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
What's he...
-- so you shut them off?
Well... This is as good a place for it as any I guess.
Tampering with a witness extraction of this magnitude makes everyone indictable at the federal level.  Trust me, we won't any problems with the hotel staff. You show 'em your ID with the letters "F.B.I." in all caps and it's instant compliance. I've seen in happen a hundred times.
No.  I'm going over there. You take the car from there, get out to the lake.
Yeah, he had the badge and everything. It said "FBI" on it.
And that didn't seem odd to you?
And threw us into the lake.
But there were more of you?
You woulda?
Damn... alright then.
...About what?
That's not possible. I told you.
The Teamsters had a reform measure going to ballot that didn't sit too well with the local syndicate. Night of the polling, big black-tie to-do downtown and the Tremor Brothers crash the party. Literally.
Possibly. Acosta is pure mercenary. And a million dollar hit fee will draw some huge flies. But forget about Sparazza's money for a moment and remember, there's no shortage of those who want Israel killed and no shortage of cash to do just that...
Israel's legal representation, the firm of Culpepper, Brody and Reed, which is currently the subject of a joint SEC and Treasury Department probe, were left holding the bag after he skipped bail. Over three- quarters of a million dollars on a bond that's set to expire in less than a day. Rupert Reed, one of the firm's partners, has learned of Israel's whereabouts and dispatched a local bondsman by the name of Jack Dupree to pick him up and return him to Las Vegas... that can't happen.  We have a Gulf Stream standing by at Reagan International to transport you two to Lake Tahoe.  It's very simple gentlemen. Valacchi, Fratiano, Gravano -- no former witness against the mob has been as crucial or has brought more to bear on the potential dissolution of The La Cosa Nostra, than Buddy Israel.
This is him? The hitman hired to kill Israel? He's a doctor?
...So you knew all this and yet y--
I don't see it like that at all.
-- Okay... hang on, I gotta move --
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
My mamma? C'mon shorty, y'gotta ask?  You hurtin' pretty bad?
True?
Like a mafucka.
A Fed? Like FBI?
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps.  ...Maybe spend the night?
...What are they doin' right now...?
What's the time frame?
You'll end up like me.
In his lab.  He won't let you in.
How much sleep?
That depends.
I wish you'd told me.
Told you what?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
Perhaps it did.
What plan?
I'll go with you.
I'll just be a minute.
As I said, then it's God, right?
You don't know?
You... she said I didn't love her.
Rheya.
It's all right.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
It put you here.  I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  I was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  I saw your mouth.  And there you were.  Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter.  The decision we make now is all that matters.  Stay with me.
A sleeping pill.  Do you want yours?
Followed by non-human manifestations.
You still writing the occasional magazine article?
Occasionally.
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
Nice.  Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Not too sure about that.
I came on at 8:00.
Sooner, the better.
Yeah, what a woman.
No kidding.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
So it was "love".
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
No dog.
You don't like him, do you?
You could do better.
It's just me.  I want to talk to you.  Let me in...
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
Pretty bad.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
You take care.
Sure we are, let's go!
Your what...?
Oh, some shit.
Where'd you get the tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
What're you talking about --
I watched TV.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
What's the difference?
Safe and secure is how we want her. Until she I.D.'s Venza.
Call a cruiser!
Koontz!  Let her come in!  Claire! It's pitch dark in here!  You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I'll take his place, all right?  Put the gun to my head.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Mom and I got plans.
Be nice.
Remember Little League?
I know.
Harry!
You make your own luck, Parker! Get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
No! Washington Square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like A-bombs.  Did you get pictures?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
Fill in the blank: "I blank Elizabeth Allan."
I'd never admit that.
No such thing as coincidence.  "God does not play dice with the universe."
I'm a photographer, remember?
How is he?
Doubtless.  And you'll have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   Somewhere else.
You're wrong.  Just for a moment, I heard, saw, felt-- I became Creation.
An extension on that astronomy paper?  Because, uh...
Really, Professor, I--
Really.  I'd like to speak with him.
You never know.  Go get some sleep.
Why? It is a wrestling match, or…
Letterman show, NBC. We'll talk then.  Bye.
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Forgive me if I don't feel too sympathetic right now.
Take some matches, see?  And a cigarette, see?  Tuck the cigarette in like this, see?  Now the cigarette keeps burning like a fuse, see?
Roger.
We'll get some more.
And maybe a little something else?
Thanks.
Okay, Security -- what happened?
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Yes, it would. Do we know each other?
They've got a summer house in Nantucket, with an upstairs polo field.  You better put a canopy over his bunk.
My legs are frozen.
What did you expect, a St. Bernard dog?
We'll know in forty seconds.  Only in a democracy can a poor guy get his keister shot off with a rich guy.
I don't know what you're talking about, Colonel.
Of course you don't. Now, Lieutenant, how would you like to join me in my quarters? I have a nice fire going.
Perfectly all right. I do not like boots.
Sprechen Sie deutsch?
I'm telling you, Animal, these Nazis ain't Kosher.
You can say that again!
Me? What if she don't want me?
He don't have to worry. He'll trade the Krauts for a six-burner gas range. Maybe a deep freeze too.
He's the grrrrreatest!
You'll fix me up!
Bombs away!
There's a time in every man's life when he wants to be alone! So go away!
Animal! Animal! Wake up!
As the duly elected Compound Chief, I protest the way these bodies are left lying in the mud.
Yes. According to the Geneva Convention, dead prisoners are to be given a decent burial.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Good.
Why the south latrine?
What radio?
Says who?
Every time the men get Red Cross packages you have to think up an angle to rob them.
You betcha. There ought to be some reward money from Mama. Say ten thousand bucks worth.
Let's synchronize the watches. Eleven forty-two, sharp.
I went to school with a guy named Price. But that was in Boston. You're from Cleveland, aren't you.
Where. Up Joey's ocarina. Didn't you know?
Ich weiss alles.
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
How many do you want? A thousand?
Not particularly.
Ja! Ja! Droppen Sie dead!
Yeah. We were just passing out guns.
Give it back. You must not arouse yourselves.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
Veridian III is uninhabited, but Veridian IV supports a pre-industrial humanoid society.
Approximately two hundred thirty million.
You get what?
Soran doesn't care about power or weapons. All he cares about is getting back to the Nexus.
What happened to you?
But why destroy a star?  Thank you, Guinan.
Where is he now?
You're right. I'll need help.  Guinan, will you come back with me? Together, we could-
It won't be installed until Tuesday.  Ensign Sulu, try generating a subspace field around the ships. That might break them free.
She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is. Nothing here matters.
That's right.
Yes.  Thank you.
An anti-matter discharge directly ahead=8A it might disrupt the field long enough for us to break away.
You want me to contact Starfleet?
Understood. That will be all.
Actually, I'm here to see if there's anything I can do for you.
Yes, yes, Captain. Thank you for coming.
Yes. I need to return to the observatory immediately. I must continue a critical experiment I was running on the Amargosa star.
The thought had crossed my mind.
The only possible reason you're here is because you're not entirely confident you can shoot down my probe after all. So you've come to dissuade me from my horrific plan.  Good luck.
You see the top yardarm, now look to the-
The star's going to collapse in a matter of minutes.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
We're only going to get one shot at this. Target their primary reactor. With any luck, their warp core should implode.
Soon, Captain... Quite soon.  
What did you see, Chekov?
Scotty...?
Thank you... <u>Sir</u>!
Sector two... Indicating desert terrain. Minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
Cross referenced and verified. An unidentifiable life form reading.
I'll handle that later.
How can you be logical at a time like this?! We have to get thee hell off this planet!
I have already made one transmission too many...
And how many have paid the price for your impatience? How many have died? How much damage have you done... And what is yet to come?
It will be hardest on Spock. Soon he will feel the burning of his Vulcan blood.
You said there wouldn't be any.
Thank you, Mr. Scott. I'll try not to take that personally.  My friends... I can't ask you to go any further. Dr. McCoy and I have to do this. The rest of you do not.
FULL IMPULSE POWER!
Mr. Scott: as good as your word.
Can we hold speed, Mr. Scott?
Go, Sulu!
Hmm.. Very odd.  Scotty. Progress report?
Oh, I'll have "Mr. Adventure" eating out of my hand. And I'll see you at the rendezvous.  All my hopes.
Welcome home, Jim.
Jim, the Enterprise is twenty years old. We think her day is over...
But, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to Genesis...
Then let me speak to the Council! Harry, <U>please</U>! I can <U>make</U> them understand!!
Because you wish it.  
Then you know how bravely your son met his death.
Then, how --
Forgive me. It is not here. I assumed he had mind-melded with you. It is the Vulcan way when the body's end is near.
But he couldn't touch me...! We were separated!
They know we would die first.
Wait!... Wait...
Our mission is over. I have failed... A human has been bolder and more ruthless than I...  That -- is the real dishonor.
How is that...?
I was not attempting to evaluate its moral implications, Doctor. As a matter of cosmic history, it has always been easier to destroy than to create --
That's all you have to say?
Exactly. Happy birthday.
And who am I hiding from?
Ah.
The order comes from Starfleet command, Dr. Marcus, direct from the General Staff.
... Can't read you... repeat...
Mistake? We're all alone here. They waited until everyone was on shift-leave to do this. Reliant is supposed to be at our disposal, not vice-versa.
Mother, go back!
Ssssh!
What do you want with us? I demand --
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
I'm Doctor Marcus!
We encoded four minutes --
I'm trying, David.
I am truly sorry.
Is that what you came here to say?
<u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
We can't fire, sir; they've damaged the photon controls and the warp drive. We must withdraw!
Visual --
What is the meaning of this attack? Where is the crew of the Reliant?
Give me some time to recall the data on our computers --
... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
Save your strength, Captain, these people have sworn to live and die at my command two hundred years before you were born. Do you mean he...  ... never told you the tale? To amuse you, Captain? Never told you how the <u>Enterprise</u> picked up the <u>Botany Bay</u>, lost in space from the year 1996, myself and the ship's company in cryogenic freeze?
Aye, sir.
She's half Romulan, Jim. The admixture makes her more volatile than -- me, for example.
Home.
To be sure, Captain.
That is wise. In any case, were I to invoke logic, logic clearly dictates that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.
Give up Genesis, she said. What in God's name does that mean? Give it up to whom?
It would explain a great many things --
And no way of knowing if Reliant is still in the area...
I have been -- and always will be -- your friend... Live. Long. And. Prosper.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
Prayer, Mr. Saavik. The Klingons do not take prisoners.  Captain.
... No, sir. It has not.
Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
You earned it.
Humor... that is a difficult concept ... it is not logical...
There is no such regulation.
<u>WHAT</u>?
Then -- you never faced that situation -- faced death...
'... no uncoded messages on an open channel...'
Engine room! What's happening?!
As you were, Mr. Saavik.
I cut your new orders personally. By the end of the month, you'll have your first command: USS EXCELSIOR.
Honors -- hup!
Aye, sir.
Indeed... May I offer you gentlemen anything?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
... My shoes...
Hamlet, Act I scene 4.
... Best shot...?
Reading the patient's vital signs.
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
Can you isolate the wave?
Like who you really are and what you're doing here and what this thing is.
Dr. McCoy, you, Mr. Scott and Commander Sulu will convert us a whale tank.
We are launching everything we have.
Whoever said the human race was logical?  Now if you'll follow me, I'll introduce you to the Institute's pride and joy.
Don't mention it. And don't try anything, either. I got a tire iron right where I can get at it.
What's going to happen when you release the whales?
You? You can't even get from Sausalito to San Francisco without a lift.
My whales? Where could you take them where they'd be safe?
Let's just say that no humpback born in captivity has ever survived.  Problem is, they won't be a whole lot safer at sea because of all the hunting this time of year... So that, as they say, is that.  Damn.
You want the details?
Lemme tell you something. I'm here to bring two humpbacks into the 23rd Century. If I have to, I'll go to the open sea to get them, but I'd just as soon take yours -- better for me, better for you... and better for them.
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
You need me.
Uhura... Can you modify the Probe's signals by accounting for density temperature and salinity factors?
Whales?
That leaves us no choice. We must destroy the probe before it destroys Earth.
Uhura. Get me through to Starfleet Command.
And another thing... It is not always necessary to tell the truth.
The hell I can't
They are very unhappy about the way their species has been treated by man.
Damn.... Damnit! We've been so lucky. We have the two perfect whales in our hands, but if we don't move quickly, we'll lose them!
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Picture, Uhura!
On speakers.
Uhura!... Where!
Sir... Estimating one nautical mile.
Give me a round figure, Mr. Scott.
Sorry, sir. We can't even do that in the 23rd Century.
Sorry, Admiral. We just thought you'll like to know, we're beaming them now.
Mr. Sulu?
Full power, sir.
Go on ahead... Close the hatch!
I will. Can my assistant come, too?
Sill? What else would I be working with?
They are my friends.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
If I were in your shoes, I'd feel the same way after what happened.  The 'artificial lifeform' is a member of my crew. Apparently, he became... ill...
We've... just begun to.  I suppose you're seventy-five.
This is a school... that's a student's work.  She'll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty years, she'll take her place among the artisans...
My power cells continually re- charge themselves.
I would gladly accept the requirement of a bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.
Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
Androids... don't have...fun.
No... I want to stay with you...
Data doesn't breathe.
If not for Data, you'd probably have been re-located by now.
Are they in any danger?
Not at all. They're fine... in fact, they're better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle tone. We should all be so lucky.
Is it safe to move her?
You're aboard the Enterprise.
From the mission...
'Just a few loose ends to tie up.'
What you're seeing is a computer driven image created by photons and forcefields...
Another time.
Picard's first officer. Do you really believe he'll listen?
If you begin the procedure while the planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until...
I wish I had better news. Commander Data attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru'afo and I have decided to send in an assault team...
Just a few loose ends to tie up. Dougherty out.
A planet in Federation space...
Right. We have the planet and they have the technology -- a technology we can't duplicate. You know what that makes us? Their partners.
There's nothing further to be gained from this...
Do you have everything you need from command?
I think it's the universal greeting when you don't like someone.
The manifold can't handle full impulse in the Patch, Commander.
Eject the core.
The purpose being...?
Deck ten.
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
Top level review, my ass. There'll be no cover-up of this. Not after I get...
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
What you're doing to my neck...
Activating injector assembly.
I look forward to reading your report.
But he's been dead for three hundred...  Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we?
As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital...
Are you saying they won't help us?
It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference.
Vulcan?
The problem must lie in the interface between Starfleet and Borg technology. Your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
Contact Starfleet Command.
I am the Borg.
Oh... just a little tinkering. How is he?
I'm having trouble scanning underground. There's a lot of radiation leaking from something.
There should be an access hatch nearby...
This is Picard. I've suspended the launch sequence.
Altitude fifty kilometers...
As they used to say... all systems are go.
Speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
Well, I feel a whole lot better with them out there. We may need some help.
We're crossing the threshold!
Main bus...
Jean-Luc Picard.
Yes.
Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning...
The invasion plans.
Invasion.
Did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
I can try.
What makes you say that?
All right. Truth. I believe that one. Why is it so urgent you couldn't wait until morning?
We have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they've done to that time-line.
Steady as she goes.
Life signs?
Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
Captain, I've scanned the planet. The atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. The oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
Admiral Donald...Bill...
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Can you - ?
Chancellor Gorkon, can you hear me? Chancellor...?
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
Uh uh. Somebody felt much worse. And I'm starting to understand why.
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
If they did we'd all have to turn ourselves in. How CAN we rely on them?
Retire.
You were incompetent! - whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink this court will determine.
The Chancellor herself will testify that the defendant's hands shook.
I don't wonder. Stop me if I'm wrong but do we really have any way of knowing if this is the real you?
I'm not sure how to take that.
I beg your pardon?
Yes.
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
I have on occasion disobeyed orders.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that under Federation law, the Captain of a Starship is considered responsible for the actions of his men?
So if it should prove members of your crew did in fact carry out such an assassination - ?
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Good enough for one - two would look suspicious... killed while attempting escape... now that's convincing for both.
Krandog aranty.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Come on, Saavik, you COULD knock -
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant -
Sir?
Starfleet will be around long enough for me to convene a Court Martial on this ship, Lieutenant. Win, lose or draw it will be on your record.
Surely not.
They're dying.
We've fired on the Chancellor's ship -
Someone said the difference between comic and cosmic is the letter "S." You haven't outlived your usefulness - to me. And you are not responsible just because she is also Vulcan -
Make ourselves a target?
I am not certain such speculations are included among your duties, Lieutenant.
Such things have happened before, sir.
A lie?
What?
Sir?
Fifty-four planets - and their gaseous atmospheric anomalies. Our sensing and analytic equipment worked well.
Nevertheless.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
That's hardly conclusive, Mr. Scott, as Klingons have no tear ducts.
Would they?
Why?
How long is that?
You're working late.
Is he very much like you were?
Can you describe it, Deanna?
As a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. Remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. He was engineered to skip thirty years of life. But since the RNA sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. He's dying.
To happy endings.
And this makes you "sad"?
To new worlds...
Sorry, sir.
Yes, sir.
There is a shuttlebay 948 meters from our current location.
Yes, sir. The Rift effects all long-range communications.
I thought only me, myself and Lore.
Captain Picard agrees that the B-9 was probably designed with the same self-actualization parameters as myself. If my memory engrams are successfully integrated into his positronic matrix, he should have all my abilities.
It seems to be a redundant memory port.  Maybe it's for provisional memory storage in case his neural pathways overload?
Emergency force fields are holding.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
Thank you.
I don't believe that, sir. We’ve shared many disappointing journeys.
And I you.
I know how he thinks.
Deanna Troi of Betazed. Empathic and telepathic abilities, ship's counselor. All of this I knew... But I didn't know you were so beautiful.
What programs were accessed?
And that's exactly what he's going to do.
He wants to look me in the eye.
Deanna, on my mark.
Aye, sir.
With or without the rest of the fleet?
A diplomatic mission. We've been invited, believe it or not. Seems there's been some kind of internal political shakeup. The new Praetor, someone called Shinzon, has requested a Federation envoy.

I am not Shinzon. I am his Viceroy. We are sending transport coordinates.
Tactical analysis, Mister Worf.
Where we will all honor the Betazoid traditions. No cold feet, or any other parts of our anatomy. Now, if you’ll excuse me.  I’ll be in the gym.
Sir --
Captain's prerogative, Will. There's no foreseeable danger... and your wife would never forgive me if anything happened to you.
It's working.
I've never met a human woman.
Our eyes reflect our lives, don't they? Yours are so confident.
I'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.
Look at me, Shinzon! Do you feel the blood pumping inside you? Your hands, your eyes, your nature, are the same as mine. Buried deep inside you beneath the years of pain and anger is a capacity you've forgotten. It's the one way our mirror can reflect the two of us exactly because it's the very thing that truly defines us. To be human is to try to make yourself better than you are.
Long ago.
Childish dreams, Captain. Lost in the dilithium mines of Remus. I'm what you see now.
Please.
I have no choices! I can't fight what I am!
On my way.
Don't forget our mission, Shinzon. We should act. Now. Time is running out.
The Scimitar will serve my needs.
But surely...
No.
Where's that?
About five miles back.
They must have picked it up in space.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
I don't like it, George...
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
Ah no.
X...
Smile.
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
No gas.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
I am Jenny Haydn.
Jennyhaydn.
I know.
My... husband.
You. Mouth closed.
You want to try it?
You better.
I do not understand.
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
No.
Yes.
Go?
It was a mistake.
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
I understand.
That was beautiful.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
I don't want you to be hurt.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
Horses.
You don't forget anything, do you?
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
The cook again?
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
I will wave to you.
I will.
You could have killed us both!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
Fly.
Get Fox.
We're ready.
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
You know that's impossible!
I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times.
Because I'm the one who called the police, you know.
I already got a real one.  Come on, it won't be too bad.  It's not personal.
You're going down.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
Watch and see.
I'm already hurting.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
You think Tran killed her?
Uh unh, carrying a gun wrecks the line of a fine jacket.
Yeah.  No, not really.
Is he dead?
Jesus!
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
What?
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
Strickland.
Aren't you peddling your wares a little far from your usual gutter?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
I've had enough of this shit.  You're on foot, Lenny.
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her.
Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Because it had to look random.  Not connected to anything or anyone.  But then why give the rape to me?
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
Mace.  I know what you think about the wire.  But I'm asking you to do this.  It's that important.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Maybe.  But tonight is probably not the best night.  Come on, we're rollin'.
It was a tough call.
How long does it last?  Oh.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape?  Save himself that way.
I'm not going.
And it didn't stop you from wanting to protect them.  Did it?
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Good, Lenny.  I can see why the detective gig didn't work out.  Come on.
Fine.  Do you want blood running waist deep in the storm drains?  The gangbangers'll spread like a wave through this city and burn it to the ground.  And when the fires start the street cops'll be capping off at anything that moves.  It'll be all- out war and you know it.
You really want that on your head?
To be honest, when I'm working, I don't look at faces much. He knew the guy's name.
You got that right. Low became obsessed with the Green River murders, the case had been inactive for ten years at that point. He argued the Green River Killer had actually become Suspect Zero, this master murderer who killed without pattern, killed literally hundreds of victims -- male, female, old, young, straight, gay -- and who was still killing, even though there were no bodies. It went against everything we knew. Low became increasingly paranoid. Every suspect was potentially Suspect Zero. Anybody tried to talk sense into him, he'd accuse them of being out to get him. Deputy Director Koessler was "out to get him." The decision was made to relieve him.
I'm babysitting the DEA guys this afternoon, Casio and I. You said that was top priority.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
You heard?
Her body turned up. In a Minnesota cemetery. They brought her back.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
Yes.
Then why do I still have a badge?
Agent Kulok and I were in O'Hare when we heard.
You didn't like anyone looking over your shoulder -- why was that? What were you doing?
Had trouble sleeping last night, sir.
That gasbag. I can imagine what he said. I'm not ashamed to admit that most of what I know about criminal profiling started with Richard Low. I have also, over the years, I admit, taken credit for many of his accomplishments. He was the most brilliant law enforcement individual I ever met.
I understand.
You're a disgrace to law enforcement, to the Bureau -- and to me.
What about the chat rooms themselves?
That's the beauty of the system. This is a fugitive chat room. It moves from place to place, chat rooms that are normally empty at certain hours: a gardening website, Chaucer buffs, a dating service. A pre- arranged code shows up in one of fifty porn rooms -- that's where I stumbled across it -- notifying "friends" to meet at a certain time, usually midnight to three Eastern Standard, at a certain website -- a deserted chat room, say, "How to Plant Perennials." Come Tuesday, twelve a.m., bingo, these like-minded deviates log on and start yakking it up: explicit sex crime gossip, who did what to whom, who wants to do what, when, why and how.
This is some serious shit.
Taking a Stryker saw, cutting off the top of someone's cranium, pulling the brain out -- what's that, a day in Spring?
You got a point there.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
What's that?
What's this country coming to?
Of course he did. He came on to every attractive student. Which bothers you most: that he exploits suffering or that he came on to me?
I've been thinking about this.
We did find these, however.
Sue Ann Hanson.
I can't. They trust me, they accept me. I've got their confidence.
Then there's the other issue.
Jaime? Where are you?
I've decided to investigate Low's plane crash. While I'm at it, I thought I'd look at the cases Koessler worked with Low.
Yeah, of course.
"Agent Low's theory of Suspect Zero, the undetected serial killer, is delusional, the product of good intentions, paranoia and obsession..."
How do you know who's real and who's not?
Yeah, problem was, I had the only copy. See ya.
Yeah.
Something came up, Murman, my man.
[Follow me.]
Haven't had any, but I'm willing to try.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[Don't jerk a jerk-off. There's nothing in the Bureau mainframe.]
Hot enough for you, Agent Mackelway? Hell's doorknob. What they got you doing?
Murman!
You've been through worse.
Shut up.
What kind of car do you drive?
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Oh, yeah... Boy, that must've been a while ago.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Mike...
You haven't told then, huh?
No.
Did you get it?
The poor thing. I'll make some coffee.
Nah, I didn't really want it anyway. I just wanted to order it.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
You want this in black chips.
...Nah. I'm right across the street...
I can call back...
Good.  I think about things.
What kind of things?
Yeah, uh, I don't think that's gonna be happening any time soon... Listen, can I call you right back? I gotta take this call...
I'm not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. Can't you talk for five more minutes?
Right.
Right... Wait, what do you mean?
Ah, see, that's the thing. Somehow they don't come back until you really don't care anymore.
There's the rub.
No problem.
Why?
Oh no?
I do. Good for you, man.
An eight.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Darwinism at its best.
I've been around here six months and I still can't get over it.
Well, that's dumb.
At least you didn't get turned down for Goofy...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Lemme get off the other line, baby.
What are you wearing? I mean, we should wear suits.
Wear a suit, I'm telling you it works.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Did she, or did she not smile?
If we don't look like we know what we're doing, then we may as well...
Always, baby.
Twenty... but I was down at least fifty. I'm sorry, I got hot at the crap table.
She likes you.
Whatever. We'll see. Daddy's gonna get her to bring a friend. We'll both get one. I don't care if I'm with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
That's bullshit.
...and then I'm struggling to impress some chick who's not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I'm not even really attracted to...
I should've said Renaissance, right? It went over her head.
"Age of Enlightenment". Shit. Like some waitress in a Las Vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure French philosophical reference. How demeaning. I may as well have just said "Let me jump your ignorant bones."...
I hope so.  We gotta go soon.
Baby, relax. It's just down the hall. She's gotta change... we'll be fine.
Baby, we're money.
Oh... "I love you... I can't believe you're doing this... Drugs are bad..." Whatever. After-School bullshit. The role is Brother.
Wait... Wait... Just "Brother". So I go in. "Hello... Hi... We loved your guest spot on Baywatch... blah blah blah..." Whatever. So, I start to read, and, Mikey, I was money. I prepared for a week. It's a starring role. I'm crying... The casting director, she starts crying...
I don't know. The whole Judy Garland thing kind of turned me on. Does that makes me some kind of fag?
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
That's just plain silly. Your self- esteem is just low because she's with someone else. But thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. It's no good, man. You gotta get out there. The ladies want to love you, baby.
Minnie Pearl.
What a surprise.
I took a ballroom class with Michelle. I never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. That Lorraine chick is good.
You think?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
You are so money, and you don't even know it...
...You're just poking at it...
...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
...Definitely...
I'm telling you. Wait three days...
Yes, I understand I'm listening.
I ask for Justice.
Then make them suffer as she suffers.  How much shall I pay you.
Godfather.
Your girl friend.  She says she can't make it tonight.  You lousy bastard you have the nerve to give your whores my telephone number. I'll kill you, you bastard!
The word is out in the streets that he's dead.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
Understood.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
And what is the percentage of the Tattaglia family?
No.  Let the people enjoy him.  You see?  He is a good godson.
It's been two years.  He's probably in trouble again.
I fought for my country.  It was my choice.
There are men in this world who demand to be killed.  They argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. These people wander through the streets calling out "Kill me, kill me."  Luca Brasi was like that. And since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...I made him my weapon.  Because I was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him.  I think you have done the same with this man.
Yes.
Good.
He had business at the hotel, but he'll drop in for dinner.
That's easy to say; it's not your father.
We should hear what they have to say.
Yes, even the shooting of your father was business, not personal...
McCluskey can't stay with the Turk forever.  We'll wait.
No.  Our informer in McCluskey's precinct.  Tonight at 8:00 he signed out for Louis' Restaurant in the Bronx.  Anyone know it.
I'll worry about Luca.  You take care of Sonny and the other two kids.
I'll try...It's what the Don would want us to do.
Mike, why am I out?
They're waiting to see my father.
Then eat your spaghetti and I'll tell you a Luca Brasi story.
Michael...
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
...who out of sheer terror had swallowed the bath towel in his mouth and suffocated.
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
Sure.
As long as I tell him beforehand he won't object.  He'll be hurt, but he won't object.
Hello...this is Long Distance.  I have a call from New Hampshire.  Mr. Michael Corleone.  One moment please.
Michael...
I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
All right, this one time I'll let you ask about my affairs, one last time.
You and I are going to move my father right now...to another room on another floor...Can you disconnect those tubes so we can wheel the bed out?
I can help you out...
Theresa.
On the three days Paulie was sick this month, he got calls from a payphone across from the old man's building.  We got people in the phone company.  Thank God it was Paulie...we'll need Clemenza bad.
Is it like they say?  Is he that good?
To the city.
I don't need them, Sonny.  I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
Cut it out.
The Turk wants to talk!  The nerve of that son of a bitch!  After he craps out last night he wants a meet.
They want me to go to the conference with Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting for two days from now.  Sonny, get our informers to find out where the meeting will be held. Insist it has to be a public place: a bar or restaurant at the height of the dinner hour.  So I'll feel safe.  They'll check me when I meet them so I won't be able to carry a weapon; but Clemenza, figure out a way to have one planted there for me.  Then I'll kill them both.
And all his works?
I do renounce them.
Just be patient.
The Corleone family don't have that kind of muscle anymore.  The Godfather is sick.  You're getting chased out of New York by Barzini and the other families, and you think you can find easier pickings here.  I've talked to Barzini; I can make a deal with him and keep my hotel!
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Yes, it's vile. Don't worry, you don't have to come.  It's great. You're going to love it.
Bastard!  Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Oh, it was.
Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog.  This is Marge Sherwood. Tom -- sorry, what was it?
I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I --
This is so good of you.
Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
No!
That's good.
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
Why are you asking all of a sudden?
You see, particularly with the Marge problem, you can just blame me.
Marge and I are getting married.
I love Marge.
Sure -- I know, that's too dangerous for you, fair enough, hey! we're brothers, fine, then you do this sordid thing with Marge, fucking her on the boat while we all have to listen, which was excruciating, frankly, plus you follow your cock around like a -- and now you're getting married! I'm bewildered, forgive me... you're lying to Marge then getting married to her, you're knocking up Silvana, you've got to play sax, you've got to play drums, which is it, Dickie, what do you really play?
Sure.
In fact the only thing which looks like Dickie is you.
Have you done something to your hair?
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Back, I suppose, slowly as I can.
My fiancée.
I'm fine.
What about Cortina?
I was just looking at you --  so quiet.
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, when did you get here?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you.  What happened to your face?
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
To the manner born.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
What?
I can't later.
Not at all. Morning Tom.
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
That Dickie murdered you and is travelling under your passport. I know, ridiculous.
A Roma, circa tre settimane fa.
No I did not. I did not kill Freddie Miles and then kill Dickie Greenleaf. Is he accusing me?  Ask him if he's accusing me!
Just because he doesn't like Americans!
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
Or Tom and Peter even.
Really, why?  Sorry, I'm completely lost.
Peter, I... I...
No.
A few days ago.
Let her in, what's the difference? Let her in.  No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later.
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
I have!
I got money.
How much to get a permit to carry?
Nah. I ain't interested.
Who mam?
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
The moon?
The DMZ?
South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
I forgot to get the Coca-Cola.
We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty...
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues.
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
Oh, Tom, please.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
No, why?
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
That's a dollar forty-seven.
The kind with a brush.
Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
One-Ball McCall?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
You carry a piece? You need one?
What's your real name?
You want to make it like this? 
Don't you want to make it?  Can't you make it?
O.K. It's a date. I'll see you here, then.
Where is home?
Huh?
You a narc?
I sure hate to go alone...
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
Have you tried the telephone?
No.
Why, thank you Travis.
Age?
Military record?
So I hear.
Hell, we ain't that much fussy anyway. There's always opening on one fleet or another.  Fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. You gotta phone?
I was in the Army too.  And I'm good with crowds.
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
Shit.
Hey Wizard.
Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do. I get some real crazy ideas, you know? Just go out and do somethin.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
You think I'm too...  ethnic for country music?
I'm a field agent.
You suppose?
I'm not a field agent, all right?  So cut me a break.
Partners.
Womack ripped it up, right?
You knew?  All this time?
I'm not a fool, Billy.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
That's my girl!  Did you...?
I had it, a minute ago...
Me too.
How'd they get it inside?
It doesn't seem right, this being down here.  It ought to be where people can see it.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
I'm  fine.  Really.  
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
I don't smoke?
Thanks.
Start with what you knew then.
Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her.
I'm not refuting anything.
I... I need a drink of water.
Mr. Appleton, you will...
When did I leave?
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
No, sir.
Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
Call me... Ishmael?
Well, at least you remember "Moby Dick."
Can we get him to the hospital?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave.
Who the hell is this "they?"
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Exactly.
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her.  She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
Of course.
Sure.  Come on in.  I was just packing.
Thanks.
Oh.
He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why?
I already have.
My girlfriend.  If she still is...
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Well, I suppose...
Just a little one.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
Shhh. Shhhhh.
Lois!
Yes?
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
Daniels.
Yes.
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Yes?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
They're back!
Let me have some apple pie, Helen.  Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls...
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
A what?
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
I got them all, Mother.
When?
Shhh. Shhh.
But they'll be back.
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
Yes.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
And locked it.
Well, I...
Lovebirds, sir?
Ahhh, but I know you.
How?
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I didn't break that window!
What are you? A policeman?
What made it...
What kind of law?
Criminal.
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Yes?
Yes.
I don't believe you.  I think you came up to see me.
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
His wife changed the channel.
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you.  Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
You were lying.
Yes, I was lying.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
Growing a beard...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
No, no...
At Annie's house. She's all right.
How long have they been gathering there?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I have no idea.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
I like Bodega Bay as well as any man. If I thought... 
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
Help how? What do you want to do?
Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them?
That would hardly be possible.
Probably herring gulls. They arrive in November, you know, and don't migrate North again until March or...
Then let's go. Now!
Mr. Gray?
I'm only a student.
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Of course I will.
Ma'am, is you'll allow me, I'd like to give you cause for courage -- Dr. MacFarlane is a great man -- I think he's the greatest man in medicine.  God would not have given him such gifts if they were not meant for Georgina's cure.
He's a great doctor -- a great man --
Come in, boy -- come in.
Excuse me.
She came again today.  She wanted me to ask you if you would not break your rule and operate.  She feels you are her only hope.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Really, Fettes, you irk me with your lack of understanding.
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Don't be a fool.  One can't begin and then stop -- and because that entry of the girl's body is in your hand, you'll do as I say. As for me, I'll tend to Gray.
They'll be thinking of that, too.
You've no thought of going there?
Why not? I must have subjects. It's the only way I can teach. It's the only way you can learn. The stupidity of the people the idiocy of their laws will not stop no -- nor will they force me to deal with such reptilian creatures as Gray. We can do our own dirty work -- and we must.
An old acquaintance, eh?
A student.  I'm studying under Dr. MacFarlane -- that is, I've been studying until today --
I've never had it all explained that way to me by so learned a man.
Would you grudge me a glass with my old crony, Meg?
Would you bribe me to leave you be?
But then I wouldn't have the fun of having you come here and beg again, Toddy.
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
Yes.
Only Brother.
Is her pain sporadic or constant?
A carriage overturned.  My husband was killed and Georgina was hurt.
I regret it, Ma'am, but I have the responsibility of training thirty other doctors to attend a thousand children like your own.
There's nothing I can say for one small child?
He must leave me alone.
You sent them. I had no choice.
Bullshit. You're a killer, that's all you are. A clown with a bird and a rising death toll. You think the world did you wrong?! You did the world wrong.
A scar. On the arm. Of the man who planted this in Alex Corvis's car.
Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
They showed me pictures, what he did to her. Evidence. Said all I had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
AAAANK. That's not how we play the game.
You're the guy killed Dutton.
I don't want to see!
Good for you. You do know something.
Doubt is a motherfucker.
You two are majorly demented. Anyone ever tell you that?
You mean Alex.
Let's hope not. License and registration please.
It was a clumsy way to introduce myself -- but I understand you're a difficult man to see.  I thought you'd have the solution by this time.
Yes -- that is true.
That's what I came to see you about.
Maybe a little demonstration.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
What do you mean, dear?
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
Yeah -- the grass was kind of wet.
Yes -- I think so.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
Wouldn't you like to meet him?
We can scare him more than he can scare us.
He doesn't know the answer. And he'll never get it that way.
She doesn't like me to steal from people.
I don't believe it.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I want to meet with representatives from all the nations of the Earth.
The first two years of television we were convinced that all you did was wrestle.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
A good insurance salesman wouldn't give you time to think.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
We could try pushing the other buttons.  I have a flashlight in my purse.
He'll have you -- and Tom.
There are no diamonds like this -- any place in the world.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
I'm gonna pray that I never need to call you.
You gotta drive!
Man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
<u>Four</u> to go.
What?...
Why?  They're only noodles.
If you ever want to see Star again, then you better come with us.
You're one of us, now -- aren't you?
For a ride.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
Phoenix actually and these Bullwinkle and...
I can't do that!
What?
If you're telling the truth, it means we can save you.
I thought we were goin' into town.
I like Michael.
He's not breathing, Mom.
Oh, no, you won't.
No.  I'm up.
Guys, I know it hasn't been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but I think you're really going to like living in Santa Carla...
Not that poor.
I guess no one cares what I got a job.
Mom.  I think we've got to have a long talk about something?
In here?
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
-- a job.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
It's you I was after all along, Lucy.  To be our day time guardian. I knew if we could bring Sam and Michael into the faimly, there'd be no way you could say no.
Okay, Sam.  Thanks.
Michael invited me in.  Never invite a vampire into your house. It renders you powerless.
Sort of.  We used to come here summers when I was kid.  Now we're here on a permanent basis.
Okay.
No.  They've made me one of them, but I miss my family.
Not yet... You're like Laddie and me... Half-vampires... You're not a full vampire until you've made your first kill... You were supposed to be mine... but I couldn't, Michael.
I know, I've felt it...
Huh?
Even poor people have T.V.s
I was here first.
Come on, Sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
I can't remember much after the Chinese food that looked like maggots.
What would that make Mom?
No.  Why?
Just listen.
So what's our problem?
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
We'll see...
Cut, bullshit.  Been pulled apart.
Am I starting to look Norwegian to you, Bwana?
That key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  Now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
I don't know how.  Because he's different than we are.  Because he's a space guy.  What do you want from me, anyway.  Go ask Blair.
What?
It's getting late.  Hurry it.  I'm going to check the last few rooms.
Yes, there is.  I'd like to go up.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Could anyone have gotten it from you?
One thousand volts.  Should be enough.
Then get a move on.  Childs, come with me.
Copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
We going to make it?
Hope so.  Another ten, fifteen minutes.  What I don't get is...
Screw the flashlights.  Where the hell were you?
I'm going to blow the generator when you get back.  He'll have to come for us -- or freeze.
Just keep looking.
Well, let's get down there.
You have books?!  Kalen, you've got to take me there.  There might be history.  Records.  Something to help us find where the Morlocks took --
About the voice in the darkness. About the ghosts...
An "automaton"?!  Please!  I'm a biomechanical organism.  Well, what's left of one.  What's left of all of them, actually.  I am the last...  ... And "these fragments I have shored against my ruins."  T.S. Eliot.  You wouldn't know him yet but you'll just love him, he's divine, if a little dour.  Very shy though... hiding over here...
Morlocks --
I was lucky.  The others weren't.
Last night.
Yes...
This way.
What do you mean?
This has to end.
No, we created the Morlocks.
Alexander, yours is a world of brocade and velvet, not tooth and claw.  Why would you come back to this?  To save a few cattle?  No.
I could tell them.  Warm them of what's to come.
When a creature shows too much independent thought we remove them from the gene pool.  We're breeding them for submission.  Soon they will be fully domesticated.
A man can change his history.
No...
I don't think that's going to happen.
And why not?
I've only read about them -- and the new internals.
What?
Trust me...
Not here... alone.  Please.
I have something for you...
You sound like my father...
I don't.  I want them to run along this street and knock off every bowler they see.
No, I'm all bowler hat, remember?
You know that's what it is.  Mrs. Watchit tells me you're here at all hours -- day and night --
I know that --
There are trains leaving Grand Central every then minutes.  A dozen liners leaving the harbor. Get on one of them.  Go to Singapore, Scotland, Manchuria, anywhere, just away from here --
Thank you...
You might find the truth rather hard to understand.
Yes.  Or forward into the future. I suppose I really should check on the machine, see that it hasn't been damaged...
I'll take you tomorrow... You must have seen a lot on your journey.
Then you came to a desert and mountains...
Is it?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Imagine that.
Animal husbandry is science, Dr. Hartdegen.  I have been breeding these fowl for fourteen years.  I have filled a library with information on their feeding patterns, social behavior and breeding.  Empirical, exacting, quantifiable records.
New Yorkers.
He said he traveled for two months.
No, I mean someone considerably older.  Your father perhaps?
Alexander, I know you're trying to help.  But they don't come back.
We choose to believe it.
No, sir.
I have no doubt of that.  I'll come by in the morning and we'll arrange it.  Goodnight, Mrs. Watchit.
What about Starks?
Depends on what you're seeing.
How?
I'm in it as we speak. [Beat] You're haunting yourself right now. [Beat] I guess sometimes we indict ourselves if no one else does. You didn't make history like you wanted to, huh, Dr. Becker. It turned out different, didn't it?
I never touched your father! I swear!
Mom, he just fixed our car.
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
How?
I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
I don't know.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
Why are you saying that? [Beat] We don't have long, do we?
I don't understand.
So it's helping?
[Beat] I don't know.
[Beat] We will.
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Come on. Tell me what you do know.
Well, what time is it?
The future doesn't look different?
Because I don't have time.
Why not?
I did?
No. Listen to me...the kid, Eugene...
Listen to me. That's all I ask.
What are you talking about?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
Good.
I tried something like 30 times. There is, as STARKS rightly figures, no suitable response to that.
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Cutting in] MacKenzie, listen to me. Listen. I'm going to die.
The Jacket.
[Beat] I'm not deaf.
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
[Beat] I was dropped off.
Sure.
Thanks.
[Beat] Real is overrated.
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
So you never knew your mother?
Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
I gotta go to Little Rock.
I do believe you.  That's what I want everybody to believe.  Trouble is, it doesn't look like an accident and you're not here to tell me about it... I need you to help me here.
Louise, I'll do anything.  I know what's makin' you run.  I know what happened to you in Texas.
Right.  Where are they?
That sounds nice.
Good answer.  Same goes double for me.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
Not yet.
I got it.  I was afraid I'd missed you.  I almost couldn't get a check cashed.  It's Saturday.
That's the code word.  I miss you, peaches.
Alright, alright.  I'm sorry.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Get the car.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
Hmmm.  We gotta get some money.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
What did Darryl say?
I'm sorry.  I'm just not in the mood for company right now.  Here.  Take this map.  I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City.  I think we should stay off the interstates.  We're too conspicuous.
She thinks he's a pig.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
I won't wait up.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about.   This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
No.
Are you sure we should be driving like this?  In broad daylight and everything?
Maybe.  Maybe.  The call of the wild!
Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico.
I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Like a Chihuahua?
I can see that.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse.  I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
Well, you got it now.
What?!  What about him?!
I believe you.
Are you alright?
What?
Yes, Thelma?
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
Wide awake.  I don't remember ever feelin' this awake.  Everything looks different.  You know what I mean.  I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new.  Do you feel like that?  Like you've got something to look forward to?
We can live in a hacienda.
I know this whole thing was my fault.  I know it is.
Way up ahead!
Then let's not get caught.
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
I don't know.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
You got a brew?
No, thanks.  Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Thanks.
Nepal? Have you been?
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
How'd you know that?
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
That sounds like fun.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
That...? Vestibule.
Sure.
Who the hell's Woogie?
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
You want her dead, don't you?
Really?  Very, very?
Jai alai?
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Same here.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
And you met Mary how?
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
Jeez, I don't know where you're ever going to find a guy like that.
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
Are you all right?
Really? I never got a message.
On your ear, you've got something.
Trying to be.
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
Yeah, sure.
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
Yeah, I'll bet you all were. Come on, in the truck.
Yeah, so... I'm gonna wait and see what happens there... But that sounds great, yeah.
Good, Ted. Piggy back ride?
And I will only issue such instructions when ordered to by the President.  John Paul Jones... you don't understand a thing, do you, Admiral?
And it can be relayed beyond Comrade Khruschev's ears to the top circles of my government
Tomorrow...
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
It's too politicized with you in there, anyway. They need to be able to stick their necks out.
Zorin will eat him alive!
What does the letter say?
Kenny. It's over.
Cuba.
It shouldn't have. But it did.
So I understand you correctly. If the missiles in Cuba were dismantled, returned to the Soviet Union, and a guarantee was made not to reintroduce them, the United States would be prepared to guarantee that it would never invade Cuba?
That is correct.
Yes. From the Highest Authority. There are two conditions. The U.N. must be allowed to inspect the removal of the missiles.
I'm doing a piece on Skybolt. I hear Macmillan's meeting with him in Nassau.
Deal.
Yeah? Who was he talking to? Acheson? Come on, O'Donnell, everyone's wondering what's going on. What's Acheson doing in town? And don't give me some bullshit about DNC think tanks. Acheson's Mr. Cold War.
I'm giving you a chance here: talk to me. You can influence how this thing unfolds.
What about you? Where are you going?
You don't show for Chicago, everyone'll know there's something going on.
Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
You're sure...
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
That may be why Khruschev's introducing this guy. We've been burned by his usual players in the formal channels, so he brings in an honest broker.
Don't get too attached.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on Indian land.
I see.
They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go. We're tightening the net on him. We know he's on the reservation.
That's right. What are you doing here? This is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.
The main problem is, Ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been amicable.
I think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.
No. I consulted it. We're going into Indian Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don't you?
Beats the hell outta me.
Get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red Nations. Militant organization.
Alright. Alright.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
And get rid of the dog.
The Little Walking River. You're right. This is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn't compensate for drought. Goddamn.
Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear --
What is it? It's genocide, that's what it is. It's a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people here. Uranium, Cooch.
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
No. We neutralized enemies of the United States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out here!
No way, Cooch.
Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your ass. This is a restricted area.
You've got no jurisdiction.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
A what?
Don't tell me: heavy duty.
Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi Spirits. It's one of those few places we'd never go to as kids. Still don't. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.
-- no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
Cut the shit. You shouldn't be in here, Man.
Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin' sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.
At Wounded Knee. I mean, that's where I was, and that's where the dream was. Why?
I'm a full-blood Oglala.
Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. They're gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
Jimmy didn't kill Leo. Why do you wanna do this?
Do you want a coffee?
Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!
I took him out before he got the chance. He didn't say nothin' about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in the dirt. Forever.
That's a big comfort to me.
Two miles.
No.
And far too aggressive.
There you go with those moves again.
Too aggressive?
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Uh hum.
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
I'm starting to sense that now.
Are you really that brave?
It's just as I thought.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
That's not what I hear.
Do what, show you a good time?
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
You're crazy.  That's a pretty silly game.
How does it go?
Off me or off you?
That's up to you.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Sir?
Outside of this gate... I...am Top Gun.
He's pissing me off!
AND HE'S GUNNING.
I'm gonna go! THREE...TWO...ONE...
But I have to!
You gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. Then, if someone shouts "Wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
Like what?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
I've had enough...for now.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Come on. I died enough for one night.
It's not the plaque. The winner can get assigned here as instructor. He gets to fight every day.
LOOK OUT!
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?   SHOOT IT.
You're a hell of a flyer.  You can be my wingman any time.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "Maverick!"
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
I like that in a fighter pilot.  It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
He was by the book, all the way.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
I know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
Whatcha doin' to me, man?!  I got six kids to feed!
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
May I use your pen?
So why am I still alive?
Listen to me, Richter, I want Quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. Have you got that?  I want him back in place with Lori.
No, sir.
Brunette.
Sleazy...and demure.
Relax, you'll live longer.
You heard the rumors about the Pyramid Mine?
A friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...Nearly got himself lobotomized.
No shit...
What are you, my father?
Come on, let's go have that drink.
Unh-uh, pal.  You've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Mmmm.....
Poor baby.  This is getting to be an obsession.
But I'm always home by morning.
Do what?
Sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  You'd hate it on Mars. It's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --I mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
Lori, move.
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
What did they do to you?  Tell me!
The hell you're not.
Beats me.  I just work here.
Mars.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
I don't wanna spoil it for you, Doug. Just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  Now you tell me.  Is that worth three hundred measly credits?
I think it's still hungry.
Get out!
I used to model for 'em, why?
I'm not a hooker!  That's my cover.
Like what?
I'm not sure dear?  What do you think?
The reactor.
It's just up ahead.
Enough for everybody to breathe?
Then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
I'm leaving it here.  Come get it and keep moving.
What?
Heather and I are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
Hang on, Burt.  The bastards are up to something.
Just barely, Pham.  What are you all doing up on your roofs. What the hell's going on?  Come back.
Val?  What the hell you doing back already?
In a minute.
Thanks.  God, I hope they're not screwed up.  I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.
No.  We go straight.
No...it was eggs.  I did eggs.
I was in one.  A bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  Wasn't so damn funny, I can  tell you.
Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nothing.  But it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
We could.  We could.  But we'd have to get <u>really</u> serious.  It's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.
So?  That car wash pays good, and they're always looking.
In the past year I must've said a hundred times "We gotta get out of Perfection.  We gotta better ourselves."  You gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I'm the reason we're still here?  You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby right <u>now</u>?
Especially when it's two hundred feet off the ground.
He's only got one damn jacket. That's him, I'm telling you.
Fifteen lousy bucks.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
That <u>is</u> the plan...I mean, goddamn it!  What the hell are those things?  How could they bury an entire Plymouth station wagon?
Oh shit!
I think we wait right here.
It's been listening to us.  It's got no eyes.  It sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so I figure...
I'm gonna help you.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Get real.  I'm faster than you.
Jesus, Val, it's pretty far.
Yeah...but no ties.
She just practically asked you for a date.  What the hell is wrong?!
You are so full of shit...
They're tearing down the houses here!  We all gotta get outta here together!  Now!
Right, geology.  And you have to be Val and Earl.  I've heard all about you.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
It does.
In other words, seven times out of a hundred, you're wrong!
Sustained.
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
...through use of informants, eavesdropping, unreasonable search and seizure...!
I'm not a kid anymore, I can't be all over the map --
-- a speed manufacturer --
-- Remember?
We're taking the other case.
Well, I mean, Roeder's gone, now... A dead end. Believe me, I'm sorry too, but...
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
Kitty, where exactly do you place the microphone to catch the most incriminating moans?
Forget it. You've blown your chance to participate in this case, Kitty.
It's okay, Eddie.
Y-yes, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Stipe.
This and that.
I'd have that checked, Mr. Reynard.
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
No, Mr. Dowd, you'll see me in court. I'm prosecuting this case.
Badgering.
The witness will substantiate Mr. Kim's modus operandi. It's circumstantial evidence in the case at hand!
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
I knew Jimmy Chin. The boy who was shot. Okay?
...And you were at the trial to... to see that justice was done?
Yeah, we do some of that.
You mean to say Mr. Kim told you that he murdered Jimmy Chin?
It's taken care of, babe. You and I are going to make a big score tonight.  This will tide you over.
Yeah, and I'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
My alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
Yep, it sure is.
Got a couple of cups of coffee at Hap's from her. That's it. By the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? I could ask you the same question.
What?
Did Gordon show you a woman named Lil?
And neither will I.
Oh, alright.  You know, I liked Agent Desmond. He had his own M.O.
Any friends?
No, I do not. I never took cocaine or any other drugs. I don't take drugs.
Code, I've heard a lot about this.
We're heading into a difficult situation.
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
I see. He does talk loud.
It must be a high priority situation.
Sure, but let's finish up with this first.
It's not late, it's early. Really early.
I think that's a good idea.
You didn't do your homework?
Thanks.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
What'll it be?
But Bob isn't real.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
No... No...
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
I already made you two tapes.
Send me a kiss.
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Okay.  Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
Oh, Laura.
What?
You'd think so.
You're getting warmer.
They were looking for wood.
Even if it offended someone, I wouldn't eat a fish eye.
I understand.
I was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which I found balled up in the bottom of your closet. Now why did you lie to me? Where did you go?
I'm sorry, Mom.
No.
No.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME.  KILL ME.
As if I didn't know.
I'm fine.
Yes.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Gruber...
They want to settle.  It means a lot of money.
No.
Just as you are, Sir...
How old are you?
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
Don't equivocate. Be positive. Just tell the truth.
Say it.
You were there to help Dr. Marx deliver her baby. Were you not?
Yes.
That's right.
...A patient riddled with complications, questionable information on her, on her admitting form...
My God, we tried to save her... You can't know... You can't know...
I was telling your wife, we have a very good case here.
I'm afraid that's not true.  Will you want me to stay on till Monday?
You know... sometimes people can surprise you. Sometimes they have a great capacity to hear the truth.
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
I am on the staff of...
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life. They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
You're going to settle out of court?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
That's a wonderful profession. My daughter-in-law's a nurse. What did you do, stop?
I was held up.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...that's true. Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
Defense...?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
Still looking.
The TV didn't work.
And are they going to get it?
Maybe what?
What...?
Is this a bad time.
That's what I am.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
If I don't 'grow up...'
No.
From the magazine?
Kathy Price.
You know what happened.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
...now who is that...?
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
Right.
The Hospital...?
I need a cigarette!  She left my office four years ago, we're looking for a chart...  I need a cigarette...
She did?
In New York?
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
Oh - there were three of us.  The others flew back in my plane.  I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
Like...ah...
I just told them the local situation. Colonel Heffner's in full charge now.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
Yes, with these suits.  We've used them before on atomic tests... Odd- looking, aren't they?
My kid brother has one.  You know why?
How'd you guess?
I think that - gizmo - is a machine from another planet.
All right.  I'll get them!   Go ahead - go ahead!  I'll catch up with you.
It was nearer than that.
If they're more advanced than us, they should be nearer the Creator for that reason!
Okay.  Send the tanker in, but you stand by until that thing cools off. Over.
Sure, sure!  Everybody understands you wave the white flag, you wanna be friends.
What?
We'll work something out.  I'm sure you'll be happy with it.
Chase, you'd better come home.
No.
These look quite fresh.
You have a fever, sweetie?
Just for a few hours.  Julie'll be with you.
No.  Tonight.  It's important!
They were safe and could sleep.
Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least.  I asked him at the funeral.
When it is denial.  I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
Absolutely.  And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again?  It gets under your skin if you let it.
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
Yes?
The car's no there yet?
Big truck went right by before you opened the door.  Life on the Fault Line.
Killing innocence, one way or the other.
Well, see, he's gotten used to being Freddy now.  And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too.  So...he's trying to cross over, from film into our reality.
That was Nancy, not me!
Me too.
Guilty.
Good.  Let's go sailing.
Watch the tell-tales Chuck.  If we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
Skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
We've got weather moving in from the west.
You came back, Tod.  You came back.
All right.  I'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
You've gotta be kidding.  Get the fuck outta my way!
Anonymous.
Because it looks good.
It was a bad dream...
Shut up, Phil.
I gotta go.
Do what?
'Cause they're getting a divorce.  That's why they sent me here.  My sister's at Tabor.  They just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
My dad.
My brother.  He fell out of the old beech tree.  Broke his neck.  I was on a camp out.  They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  They didn't find him 'till the next morning.  They didn't even know why he was up there.
I couldn't.
You can't run from the wind son. You trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  Bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
Your cannons made a compelling argument.
No.
Let the blow drive the boat down wind.  Neutralize our canvas.
Well, you never can tell these days, can you?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
You do?
And being sixteen.
What's that?
Oh, praise the lord.  Relax everybody.  Everything is under control.  The jug head's going to think of something.
Trust me donut.  I know.
I figured it out.
I don't have to listen to this.
You know what he is talking about here?
Barometer's dropping.  The first blow'll come from the south.  Might get interesting.
What's that?
You've gotta be kidding?
Roger Meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
Were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
What makes you so sure it was one?
You really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
I don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
It wasn't hard.
Then what are you trying to say then?
Screw you, Valentino.  I haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
I was trying to get her up wind! That's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  Or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
How old are you?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
No.
Forty bucks...
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
No... She's fine. Back home.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Mr. San Pedro Sula's permit to kill.
United States Marine issue, before they made the unfortunate switch to the less dependable nine millimeters. I have it here, in my briefcase.
It has its moments of uncertainty.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
This 'bout the fifth time?
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Yeah?
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Hell, peanut...
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
You mean like pedal pushers?
What kinda trash talk is that?
Come look at this.
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
Uh huh.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
You knew my daddy?
Yeah, I'm here.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
There's worse places, honey.
SAILOR!!!
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
Fan works.
Yeah?
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
So where'd you say you was?
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
Let's leave here.
That was in Vietnam.
What?
SAILOR!!!!
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Santos... It isn't.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
Just tell me what you want.
You need to explain it.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Through the forehead?
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Yeah, but you gotta know what it's about, right? I mean, if you didn't know what it was about, why were you writing it?
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
How are you, Crabtree?
If it can produce a Miss Sloviak you'll get no argument from me.
Great. I was hoping I could get a look at it sometime this weekend. Think that might be possible?
But. ...why didn't you say something, Tripp? I mean, what are we doing here?
Primarily. Although I gather you two staged a little raid on the Crabtree pharmacopoeia. You missed a few bottles, by the way.
He finished it Winter Break.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
He lives with his mother.
Hit your brakes.
Think, Hannah. Does James have any friends. I mean, besides you and... me?
Kidnapped? By who?
Oh, come on, Tripp. Cut the kid some slack.
There is no problem. Did I say there was a problem?
In a sense.
Do you know he won't expel him?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
This 1966 maroon Ford Galaxie 500. You driving this car?
I've been doing that a lot lately.
The last month maybe.
I've been trying to finish a book...
And your wife left you.
So is my friend... is Sara still here?
No. There's no one here.
And you're saying it's some kind of sign? What the fuck's the matter with you?
Stop calling me Vernon.
It used to shoot these little paper caps, but they don't make them anymore. The caps.
Huh? Oh. Son of Fury. With Tyrone Power and Frances Farmer.
She went crazy, Frances Farmer.
It's not bad.
They really hated it. I think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
A little.
Really.
Like the lady herself.
I guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he doesn't mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
He's dead, James. Believe me, I know a dead dog when I see one.
Yea, James.
Trust me, James, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner doesn't want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
I thought you might -- I don't know -- swallow your tongue or something.  I guess you really miss her, huh?
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
That's a big book you're writing.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
No one seems to know where you live, James. Hannah thought you'd like my couch.
Well, James, you did shoot the Head of the English Department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
Shit, James, you're hungover. What do you think's the matter with you?
Your father worked in a mannequin factory?
Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school?
Kinship.
Sure you do. You were thinking: 'That's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' You were thinking 'I can't let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' You were thinking: 'I've got to find a way to distract this kid.' So you did. It was -- in its way -- a noble act.
Because of my coat?
Jealous? Of me?
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
I never said that.
In a minute. Get us a table.
When?
Okay.
I'm not going, with them.
I'm not worried. You're not worried, are you. Professor Tripp?
I'm a little worried, James.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
I thank you.
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
Hh-uh. Last time I saw it was...
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
Jesus.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Simple.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
You heard? How?
I know that. I know what's at stake here...
That... and you.
What's he doing out there?
Honestly. Someone stole my car. I parked it right there last night.
Would Walter really press charges?
And you're old.
Some times...
Forget it. I should've known better. Your friend is just, I don't know, into collecting weird tricks. Mind?
Like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he's too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
He said he hasn't had a success in ten years and everyone in New York thinks he's kind of a...
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
It's no Arsonist's Daughter, but I guess you know that. It's a young man's book. It got me remembering how it felt to be young.
No, I'm going ho --
Well, Q certainly will. And, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
Foreman now.
Booming. Lots of building going on. We can't keep up with all the work. In fact, I just hired a few new guys...
Something wrong with that?
I like the noise.
You're the only one in the family who still talks to me.
She'll be twelve next week. We're throwing a big party on Saturday. Wish I could ask you to come...
Huh?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
It's hard to describe.
Cop.
Got something to hide?
Don't be witty.  Yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. Why did you stay on the bus, Walter?
I'll be asking the questions.  Last night, you hear anything unusual? Screams? Shouts?
I didn't say what time the assault occurred.
Then I'd say you're a lucky fellow.
'Fraid not.
But you are taking it?
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
I will be in three months.  I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
Do you have many friends?
No.
That's okay... doesn't matter.
Tell Ms. Kramer what your daddy does.
What will happen if I do?
Someone will talk to your daddy. And then he'll stop doing those things... the things you don't like.
It's getting dark. Go home.
Bad idea.
It's very good, indeed.
Honest? No.
Have to talk about something.
Talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
Then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
You don't know!
I know you're frustrated, Walter, but --
We'll talk about it more on Thursday.
Why?
To relax.
Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
Where?
Where are you?
I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
Did you and your sister often take naps together?
This is garbage!
Okay I'll tell you what I did -- just to shut you up!  I smelled her hair.
K through sixth.
What?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
Not tonight.
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
What did you do to them?
Between ten and twelve. Once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. Once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. I always asked how old they were.
Twelve years in prison?
You should be shocked. Or do you get off on this shit?
You must hate your brothers.
I love my brothers.
Us seeing each other.
Just think about it.
Most people don't have my kind of problems.
What's your fucking problem?
I'm alright, I'm dealing.
Yeah, yeah... yeah.  It's turning.
Folks, I've just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
I... they're all dead, Bud.  They're all dead. I thought... some of them... you know...
Yeah, okay.  Okay.
Not in this thing.
We've only got one suit.
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
No way!  Forget it.  Not an option.
It's the only way, Bud.  Now trust me.
Tell me later.
Okay... Hippy's not going... McWhirter, you can run Little Geek.
I'm not interested in your way of doing things. Just get your team ready to dive.
It's gotta be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the Russians... Hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. Oh, uh... hi, Lins.
Yeah!  I mean, I don't know... it looks right.
Okay, here we go.  Start equalizing, y'all.
The magnetometer is pegged.  Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet.  Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
Copy that.
Going over the wall.  Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
I gotta tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  A.J. Squared Away goddamn jarhead robot.  Okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
Deep.  It's classified... you know.  Anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can't be compressed. Pressure doesn't get to you.
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Through three miles of water?   I don't know.
In this case, getting married means nothing. Aren't we already the same as being married? And Corrado and Giulia -- aren't they already the same as being married?
Then why don't you try it on?
At what?
And that's what I say, too. We could have all been killed.
And why haven't they left each other?
I don't know why. I just couldn't help it.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
Does it please you to say such things?
I don't know about that. And then, who's interested in beautiful things nowadays?
What! Get married?
Okay. In a few minutes.
No reason why...
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
I don't love you.
Have you ever been in love?
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
To do what?
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
I detest comparisons made with oil.
Do you know why? Because if you saw those ruins I'm sure you would have said they were very, very beautiful. You always say "how beautiful" to everything -- whether it's the sea, or a baby, or a cat! You have such a sensitive little heart that it throbs for anything.
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
Anybody can hold a brush in his hand. All you need is to buy some oils and start painting. Even Rembrandt did the same.
Answer me, why don't you try posing? I'll paint you a beautiful portrait.
Now, we're getting somewhere! They're beginning to contradict each other.  Now look here, your friend just swore to me that you weren't able to do any fishing at all because the sea was too rough... And what about the other boat?
Yes, she takes care of the garden.
Very well. First of all, I'll have them search the waters around the island. I brought two frogmen with me... Meanwhile, we'll take a look up around here.
There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
No. The owners are in Australia.
And how come you're up so early?
Anna is an excellent swimmer. Even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.
I don't see why I should mind.
Yes, we will.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
Oh... I'm sorry I have to rush but I've got to write a story about this thing that just happened... Tell me exactly how it all turned out.
Who knows?... Another one has it that she entered a store in Troina. This information comes from the storekeeper himself who stated that such and such a girl had bought I don't know what in his store... at Troina.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
Why?
No.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Yes.
That wasn't me.
God!  But there's nothing to say about God.
Yes.
And what did you do?
I... I don't understand.
Anything?
Would you like to be?
Why should I?
Like what?
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
Like you?
A mistake... it was a mistake...
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Everything... I don't have children.
Answer me!  You never answer me.
You can tell me.
Why?
Please!  I want to help you. Let me help you.
As much as God loves you.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
No.
Fish...  ... brussel sprouts.
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby?  Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
No.
I have to throw up...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why.  Oh God... I don't wanna...
No... don't hit me please...
Frightened.
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
It was alive wasn't it?
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Who told you this?
Well somone's got to suffer for this Doctor. You've got to be merciful and quick. Excuse me.
Two packs a day.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
That she was unconscious, yes!  So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
She stopped eating completely...
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
Aquittal.
Yes.
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Right...
Mary Magdelen?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth.  No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles.  Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
The father!
Why must he be anybody?
This is insane.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her?  You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Somebody told her.
Yes.
You wanted that child out of the way.
Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
Nine.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
Ah ... a shamus, eh?
No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.  Can he read?
Of course I can.
I'll have a bash.
Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
Yeah, she was fickle.
I don't really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, didn't it?
Yes, you're quite a feather in the cap.  Hello, I've got one ... oh, I think so ... yes, he can talk ... Well ... I think you ought to see him.  Of course, right away.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
You're from Liverpool, aren't you?
Are you pulling my leg?
Thank you.
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
What's that mean?
The big hammer?
They ought to be.
Oh, I don't know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
I bet you don't sound like real people.
Why? I mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
Why selfish?
Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
Pity.
Quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
Well ... what's the matter with that?
Books are good!
You're living, are you? When was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? When did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
Yeah ... that's right.
You're only right.
Well I'm not exactly a voluntary patient.
He can talk then?
It's your nose, y'see. Fans are funny that way. Take a dislike to things. They'll pick on a nose...
It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
Shall I?
Foreign devil ...
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You've got a midnight matinee.
You're a swine. So hurry up ... we're travelling!
Well, you look like him.
And my nose...
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
But...
Do I have to raise me voice?
Who?
Down the ... er ...
Well ... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
Yeah, it's you all right.
Do you remember the pyramid?
There are no commercial lanes out here.  Face it, we're out of range.
Well, line of sight is impossible due to dust.  Radar gives me noise. Sonar gives me noise.  Infrared -- noise.  Let's try ultraviolet.  There. Flat.  It's totally flat.  A plain.
Martin, we're going in.  I'm going to hold the conversation to a minimum from here on.
Chaz, this is Dell.  Can you come topside for a minute?
Can you see anything in the hole?
God I'm hungry.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
Unknown.
It is none of the 678 dialects spoken by technological man.
I have a temporary sequence on the monitor --
Yeah!
Not <u>they</u>... <u>he</u>...
Jay, we've got a problem.  I was wondering if there was any way you could shortcut the repairs and give us immediate takeoff capability.
What do you mean?
Hurt!  How?
I kind of like it.
No, I don't want us separated.
You can't tell -- that kind of stuff could represent printed circuits...
Well, how does it feel to be rich men?
Ask him.
How many?
I guess I had it coming.  Let's call it settled.
It's some kind of organ -- it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.
And right next to it, that oval design with the markings -- it's a dead ringer for the spore casings.
Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
It's not going to work.
I should hope so!  And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
Thanks for the thought. 
Feast your eyes.
Computer, what's the frequency of the transmission?
That creature sure must have considered it important... using his last strength to draw it...
I couldn't make it out -- too much interference.
How the hell should I know?  Come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!
Yes, thank heaven.
They're from a dead civilization; they're spores from a tomb.  God knows how long they've been here.
We've got about a week left, right?
Couldn't the pyramid have been built here by space travellers?
Right.  Fire up all systems.
Anything else?
Oh well... you know me.
But why draw it on the wall?
All right, so that's what we've got. A week.  It's plenty of time.
So the next step should be --
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core.  In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
Look...
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
I told you we... what's that?
Yep...
What's happening?
Too many.
Comin' up the Central Reservoir.
I lose 'em all, that's why I'm still out here on this rock.  Anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
Force the door.
Do it.
Alright, let's keep calm.  We've got to have an option of some sort... there's got to be a way out of this.
Just got a reading...
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Forget it, man.
Well... try the headset.
Blow those suckers, Driscoll!
No, not really.  More sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
Four.
Only six?
Nothing.  With the satellite down, we can't transmit over the mountain range. He's most likely sitting there wondering why he can't raise us.
Do you think Ackland'll sit tight?
There'd have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
When we get the link back, and I send this in, I.C.C.'ll throw a fit.
Don't wait for me!
What can I do?
Phoebe?
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I expected to find this little room overcrowded, with a theater full of people at your feet...
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
That's right.
San Francisco. An oasis of civilization in the California desert. Tell me, do you share my high opinion of San Francisco?
And that memorable night when Margo first dazzled you from the stage - which theater was it in San Francisco? Was it - the Shubert?
You take charge.
I'm not surprised. After all that humble pie...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
You know me better than that.
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
We're?
Yes, you did. You still do.
Champion to champion.
What of it?
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
I had lunch with Karen not three hours ago. As always with women who want to find out things, she told more than she learned...  ... do you want to change your story about Lloyd beating at your door the other night?
Couldn't go on? You'll give the performance of your life.
Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
It just slipped your mind.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
This is Eve Harrington.
Where?
Thank you so much.
I'll try.
Everybody can't be Gregory Peck.
Wait a minute! You can't hang up, you haven't even said it-
Sure! Like the Western Union boys used to do...
It won't play.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
It's a pretty rare quality these days.
I've always denied the legend that you were in 'Our American Cousin' the night Lincoln was shot...
Nothing, really...
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Everybody has a heart - except some people.  Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
Eve?  How enchanting...  Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
The gong rang. The fight's over. Calm down.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
Just being happy? Just stopping all this nonsense about Eve - and Eve and me?
That suddenly makes the whole thing believable.
Glory Hallelujah.
I told you a lie. We'll make it easily. Margo's got no more conception of time than a halibut.
I just wondered.
Why you have to go out there.
Eighty percent of it will go for taxes.
The Theatuh, the Theatuh-  - what book of rules says the Theater exists only within some ugly buildings crowded into one square mile of New York City? Or London, Paris or Vienna?  Listen, junior. And learn. Want to know what the Theater is? A flea circus. Also opera. Also rodeos, carnivals, ballets, Indian tribal dances, Punch and Judy, a one-man band - all Theater. Wherever there's magic and make-believe and an audience - there's Theater. Donald Duck, Ibsen, and The Lone Ranger, Sarah Bernhardt, Poodles Hanneford, Lunt and Fontanne, Betty Grable, Rex and Wild, and Eleanora Duse. You don't understand them all, you don't like them all, why should you? The Theater's for everybody - you included, but not exclusively - so don't approve or disapprove. It may not be your Theater, but it's Theater of somebody, somewhere.
Also Addison deWitt.
Every day.
You didn't have to tell me.
I have a suggestion.  There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Only thing, what I go after, I want to go after. I don't want it to come after me.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests.  They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Don't be dense. The party.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
That's all.
Subway.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance?  But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Not just that way. As a friend...
Karen.
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
Of course.
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Hi.  "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
He's in love with you.
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman...  ... slow curtain. The end.
- everything a playwright first thinks of wanting to write about... until his play becomes a vehicle for Miss Channing...
What is?
What a way to die - trying to get an actress to the theater in time. Tell Max I want to be buried with royalties...
Eve.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
Not much.
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
She is a louse.
I mean really, deeply angry...
But that was the fourth straight time.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
--mine's better--
Let me lay a little theory on you--
I met a Presidential aide once at a social occasion.
Were you eyebrow reading?
It's not us, they were scared before we got there.  What do we know?
We appreciate your position--really.
'68.
You mean, who's going to play the mean M.P. and who's going to be the nice one?  Whichever.
--I haven't said anything--
--because a year before, the Republicans weren't ahead, not in the polls, Muskie was running ahead of Nixon then. Before he self- destructed.
--we're working on the last guy now and we're going all the way--that fifth man was Haldeman.
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Only everything...
John N. Mitchell, while serving as US Attorney General, personally controlled a secret cash fund that--
--jeeeeeeesus--
--almost a year before he left the Justice Department--
Oh.
This?  Naw...
And you will.  But not now.
Good. Just tell him I was here, that I'm sorry I missed him--
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
--what?--
You're two months behind--you got enough to cover?
Give me your checkbook then.
There's always a later plane.
--you don't really think you're being followed?
What do you want to know?
Just tell me about the goddamn article.
That's another of the things I'm not so sure of.
--my wife just had the baby, my in- laws are arriving, I'm trying to get the house in some kind of shape.
Is he on the level of Assistant to the President or not?
Mitchell started the cover-up early, everyone is involved in the cover- up, all the way to the top. The whole U.S. intelligence community is mixed in with the covert activities. The extent of it is incredible.  And people's lives are in danger, maybe including ours.
OK.
Are you implying you don't believe me?
...you're definitely doing a story...?
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Total manipulation. I suppose you could say they wanted to subvert the Constitution, but they don't think along philosophical lines.
--don't concentrate on Segretti or you'll miss the overall scheme too.
There were more then.
And Justice and FBI know all this?
--yes, yes, what is it?
Good God!
James McCord.
I really want to know.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
--this White House guy, a good one, a pro, came up and asked what is this Watergate compulsion with you guys and I said, well, we think it's important and he said, if it's so goddamn important, who the hell are Woodward and Bernstein?
Just that on his office wall there's a cartoon with a caption reading, "When you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow."
Could develop.
--go over your sources again--
When so ordered.
I'm not Miss Abbott.
Oh, well...  It came from the heart.
You're a killer, Ozzy!
Sorry, coach.
I'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
Single malt?
Aged eighteen years.  Why don't you get the glasses.  Behind the bar.
Yes ma'am, I am.
You're gonna shit your pants!
Nah.  Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing.  I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight.  But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her.  And I don't know what I'm gonna say.  So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
What's your middle name?
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Because I want to.
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  Cool then.  I'm um, I'm glad you came by.  I mean, really.
What?
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
What's that?
No, that's not what I mean.  I mean -- look.  You know what made me leave that game?  Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
You called me Oz.
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
Well of course I'd want to give her that.  I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
But --
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
What was your name again?
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
Apple pie...  McDonald's or homemade?
Shame on you!
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
That's my trick!
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
Yeah, right here.
I love you.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
Well, no.  I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
That's the spirit.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night.  Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
That junior chick?
Stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
Exactly.
The key is don't look down.
You try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
Ha ha! Yeah right, white boy! Ha Ha ha.  I think maybe I drank too much.
Rip my face off? Hey, we all make mistakes. Hell, I didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. But I did, and now I'm paying the price.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium.  The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Are you okay?
I don't... I... I can't remember...
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
What?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.  Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
I leave these open. Maybe something comes back to you.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus... 
Uncle Terrence.
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
What did she say?
He says -
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
Double merde.
I was showing Sonya something . . .
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
Who's Sophie?
Why?
You are the Princess.
It's the best fork of all
It used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
Sad?
I'm sorry.
It's okay. Didn't hurt..
I'm glad you	did too.
No, not about the ceremony, Anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
Is it? Is this what you want?
And this is my future. This is who I am!
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
Okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like Anastasia is ... still alive.
I cursed then all!
Bartok... a question.
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
I want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
I should go
Promise me she'll have her home.
Oh, Dmitri.I wish that I could.
You gave the orders!
Oh, heavens I must say... no, no actually, I can't - Tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
What's your name?
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
This is Alvy Singer!
I took a meeting with Freddy. Freddy took a meeting with Charlie. You take a meeting with him.
No, because they're-they're laughing, so  I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
Lyndon Johnson?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
That movie makes me feel guilty.
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night.  Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
Yeah.
Oh, right.
You want your tennis stuff?
Yeah, my grammy.
No, I got time.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Yeah.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Gimme a kiss.
Oh, all right.
And we'll digest our food better.
No.
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be...  ...to be miserable.
U-huh.
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Yeah, I know it's small.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
U-huh.
M'hm.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Well, what is your definition of following?
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Yeah?
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Will it change your wife?
Will it change my life?
David! David! I can't believe this!
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
It was just great!
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Yeah?
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
I don't know.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play.  Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
I have a headache.
Bad?
It's the influence of television. Yeah, now Marshall McLuhan deals with it in terms of it being a-a high, uh, high intensity, you understand?  A hot medium... as opposed to a...
Hey.
Sure.  just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
Forget it, Max.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
You all right?
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
V.P.L.?
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
She's a colored woman, from Harlem!
If only I had the nerve to break up, but it would really hurt him.
Oh, you remember her, Annie.
No.
We're going to take them to the airport.
Yeah.
I really enjoyed it.  Nice to have metcha. Good night.
Oh.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Oh yes.
Did you know the contractor?
It has your ring.
Any thoughts on casting yet?
Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal.
I'm in mourning.
This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair.
Borrow whatever you like.
Don't you miss it?
Never.
You should have brought him.
Yeah.
Damn straight.
Fuck you.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
We've heard lots about you.
Well it's fucking time.
Hey!  Would you?
Anytime, sport.
I love you, you're a genius.
We've only been over this how many times?
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Ryan's novel?
Accept a compliment.
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
For good.
What?
I'm going to throw up.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally.
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Yes.
Everybody hates the messenger.
That's under lock and key.
It's a novel.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
Oh.  You're serious.
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I'll be your best friend.
That's a lot of those.
I like you.
Yeah, it was.  For a writer nothing's sacred.  No, nothing at all.
No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck.
Not good.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
Yes.  And you've met Joe.
Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator.
I'm so sorry.
Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov?
Do Peter Sellers again.
Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Are you asking me to marry you?
No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two?
Oh great.
You see, that's worse.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
I wasn't finished.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
You know it's true.
Well, something's wrong.
You're my best friend.
I guess.
I'll be right out.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
Hm.
Z, old pal...  SHUT UP!!!  It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
It's a shame he died prematurely...I was hoping to kill him myself.
Ah, yes.  Well, charmed, I'm sure.  So, Princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
Oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
General Formica won't let me die out here.  I'm his fiancee.
There isn't anyplace else --  Except the worker bar.
Darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
Don't get all sappy about it!
Hang in there, buddy!  You can make it!  Just -- take deep breaths, I'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
Well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
Oh, no, sir!
...Not enough food?
Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
I can't think of any.
Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
Yeah, I know.
Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection!
You heard the ant -- DIG!!!
Something the matter?
Why?
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Really?
You mean tonight?
Oh.  You mean -- like a girl-friend?
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
Oh, I understand.
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Three.
That's right.  I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
You don't want me here --
No -- I don't want anything.
Someone from the office.
What's your friend's name?
Give what up?
I don't want it.
Cut.
No doubt about it.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza --  I'll be right back -- okay?
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
Over a girl?
That's terrible.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
That's very wise.
I'm fine all over.
Seven --  -- queen.
Last night?
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
You do?
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Not that I have anything to hide.
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
What?
Oh.  Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Yeah --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while.  Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA  It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
Who else?
I'll pay you on Friday.  And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Well -- see you, Doc. 
Let me get my bag.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
Sure.
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Who is Mickey?
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Who?
Kubelik.
Doctor.
And what happened to you?
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
You know I liked it better long.
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Remember what we talked about?
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You know I do.
Yeah, we better.
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran?  Fran --
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
What's the difference?  Some schnook that works in the office.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
What gives?
Lovely. You were a big help.
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
Dreadful.
Look -- the girls could get killed -- we're not supposed to be this close combat, I mean real combat.
Delta ?
No.
You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.  I swear to God I would have, too, if ...
No shit.
Chef -- since you're such a fan of Miss December's I think you should be detailed with Lance and Clean to take the first drum up there.
Whatdoya think it thinks.
How much is left?
Thirty meters up, Lance; I saw the fucking flash.
Chief, try to keep out of where we're going -- Why we're goin' and what's gonna be the big surprise.
All right I got a little surprise for you --
Whose orders ?
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
Terminate with extreme prejudice.
What is it?
Okay, Willard, sit down.
I always thought the French came here to get the rubber.
Napalm, boy -- nothing else in the world smells like that --
What?
You want'a surf, soldier?
Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line.
Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you.
I met him.
Don't you agree?
I met him.
Yeah. Classical stuff -- scares the hell out of the slopes -- the boys love it.
Captain B.L. Willard reporting his presence, sir.
You were not coming here, to see me?
I can handle it.
Stinks. I could never figure --  I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes.
You were his friend... You must have been, if he had given you this...  If he sent you to his home. He was the best this country had -- he was --
He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down.
We'll be needing some supplies and fuel -- do you know anybody who can give me a hand?
Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him.
His name is...
What's a big question?
175  CONTINUED:
I'll get you there all right.
94   CONTINUED:  
I just want this over with.
28   CONTINUED:
She's dead.
I was hoping you had some news --
Eric, leave it alone.  It's not your business.
So what's the problem?
Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.
Yep.  Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these.  Didn't expect we'd already met.
No big deal.  We just got off on the wrong foot.  What's your name?
That makes the flight more interesting.
-- Turn around.
Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
It could blow over tomorrow, too.
What?!  Fuck off.  Save yourself.
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
You broke the radio, remember?
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Back at my place... he, uh, broke his leg.
Just stay out of my face until I'm gone!
What are you talking about?
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Ease off.  We do this my way.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
Carol the waitress?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Yes.
The stiff one eye?
Two days.
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Whether crabs are in season there now...
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Yes... sure.  I'll take the sofa.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
And?
Okay.
It was a mistake.
This one has a special meaning.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
What do you want?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm gonna grab you.  I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Good night.
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
He's a pain in the ass.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
What?
You little stinker. He's given you everything.
Terrify me?
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?...  Just tell me.
Not just today -- Uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
Oh, is he dead?
What's he look like?
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
It smells like shit in here?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Got any easier questions?
This stuff is pointless.
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
I'm going back with you.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
I'm coming.
But you know where you're lucky?
No...  Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
No.  No I'm not.
What is this?
What?
Yeah, that's it.  And he's like a fucking genius.  They said he shaded you over and over.  And in the end, he aced you again.  Shaded and faded.  They say he's living on some Greek island, but I say that's fucking bullshit.  I say you're the best and that you planted his ass. Am I right?
Bullshit.
What does that fucking mean?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
I'll tell you this.  After Cleveland, I thought I was lucky to be alive.  But now, here, I just realized that you were the lucky one.
You're too late.
Because he is trying to retire me.
What do you want to know?
We played with a code using <u>The New</u> <u>York Times</u> obituaries.  Over three years we played twelve matches.  I never won.
Why didn't you finish this game?
Languages.  I was already fluent in nine languages.
You were like a boy genius?
No, they didn't.
The exotic women.
They tried to kill you?
The only thing different about the private sector is that a General Contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  Then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it's the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
Are they usually like that?
You said you didn't trust it.
Where is it?
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
Book.  Sunglasses.  Great.
Sorry.
We split the money?
Yes.
I waited until I was insane and then I walked into the bank.  He was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
I went into their room this afternoon.
What?
No.
Uh-huh.
I'm not normal.
Okay.
Electra --
Honesty.
Do you believe that?
Just a little ways.  Up to those trees.
Sure.
Funny, I've never been a talker. My wife was always getting on me about that.  'Say what you feel, tell me what's bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  I never would though.  Not really.
I hope not.
Oh yeah?  I guess we still need to see that price tag.  Like art, right?  You hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
That's what our General Contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
What are you thinking about?
Anything.
I have all day.
Squatted it.
You've got to stop using that word "we" it's getting kind of scary. Right Katka?
No thanks, I think we ought to get going though.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
So?
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
No....The Asylum!
They'll never get us.
So why didn't we?
We don't speak Czech!
Sure, I think it_s your turn to buy too.
No, not yet.
I can't, I've got to split. I have to take a class at two o'clock.
She's as American as apple pie too. Have you figured out exactly what it is you despise about them?
Well, I take it you're going to drag her down to your minimal existence and adjust her mindset.
Nothing, it's just that's when things usually start to go wrong.
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
That bad?
Huh?
Did you see anything in the files?
And if you're wrong.
Here!
Look, I don't care whether you go with Doug or not, but you_ve got to see him before he leaves.
What?
Yeah!
Okay, but I don't want to miss him.
That's my mum's.
I see, would you like us to inform her of your situation?
Now, have you been read your rights and are you aware of the charges?
Sure. Excellent.
How about you Brutus?
But we could go to London and live in England.
Not this time, Kat.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Sure, they are students.
Can we charge admission?
Don't worry. Thanks.
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Thanks.
You will wish you hadn't.
Fuck you!
A kind of freedom.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
Yeah!
You don't have fifty foot of apartment!
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
What for?
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
No. You're with who you should be. It's like she chose you.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
No. Hey. We're sorry, man!
I don't make small talk --
I don't want to have any conversation.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
So you agree you need help?
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Do you think I'm strange?
Could be...
Yeah.
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
Belinda's a very jealous person.
Healthy as can be.
Thank you. So were you.
Prove it.
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Twice a year.
Mars.
Sure.
No.
Where? Why?
I'm sick.
That I want you to take me home.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
I have expectations, too.
I need to be with her.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
I'd do that --
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
Where did you get -- ?
And you never heard of rock 'n roll?
No....
Have we ever met before?
Coming, Eileen...
Eileen, Chinese food again?
Oh yeah.
Jeez, what do you think? To see it!
But I've never picked a fight in my entire life!
You're not picking a fight, you're coming to her rescue. Maybe we'd better go over the plan again. Where are you gonna be at 8:55?
George it's not your concern. Don't worry about it. Just remember that at 9:00, you'll be strolling through the parking lot and you'll see us -- struggling in the car, you'll run over, open the door and say....?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Yeah,  Right.
Shhhhhhhh!
AM or PM?
Pro, the sun's out!
Jeez, for a guy with a ton of clocks, you sure don't pay much attention to time.
...To be traveled through
Yeah, a shopping mall. You know, a shopping mall?
That's just great!
What if you lost your keys?
Well, it was there.
But that's impossible!! George asked her out! He had to! I saw him walk her home! Oh, God!
Nobody said anything about hitting her! You're just going to take a few liberties with her.
Look, Marty, she's not your mother yet. And if you don't go through with this, she may never be. I know it's hard, but there are some things we must do in life that are unpleasant. Some choices must be made that are difficult. Nonetheless, we must make them. Besides, this may be more than a simple question of your own existence, he added. The fate of the entire space-time continuum may rest on your shoulders . Marty tried to smile at him.
1982! March 18, just like we planned! My calculations were absolutely correct! Thirty years! God, I cannot believe it's been thirty years! Sure, it was a long time ago -- longest I've ever had to wait for the results of an experiment!
87 states? Time travel bans? What the hell?
It's the most beautiful city I've ever seen! What is it?
No way!
He said not to tell.
Okay.
What do you mean?
She plays the clarinet, too.
I'll catch up with you.
Oh, flies... grasshoppers when I can catch 'em.
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
I mean it.
What're you doing?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
Sure.
He'll say that?
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
I know.
Is that all there is to it?
Why?
Excuse me.
Yes.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Really?
No, of course not. It's only that he called last night and asked if I could come by.
Sure.
This your place?
Yes.
Maybe.
Forty-six Yoyodyne employees.  Grover's Mill, New Jersey, 11/1/38.
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper.  You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--?  They'll be worried.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
The creatures?  They attacked you?  They tried to possess you?
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
What? How do you know that?
Orson Wells?  What about Doctor Lizardo?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill?  No way.  Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster.  It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
No, I don't.
Who does?  It's a crazy mixed-up world.  Just do the best you can with what you have...
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Go where?  Where're you going?
Believe in Penny Priddy?
You're thinking of Mr. Wizard.  This guy's an eccentric genius.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
She's just a damn road hugger, Allison.  Plus the man can drive.
What?! He's a son of a bitch!
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
...Who is this?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
A week, eight, nine days –
It's still a little early for me.
What's that?
A souse!
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
I'm fine, garland, but I have to talk with you.
That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
Yeah, I guess that's tragedy right there.
Nope.
Sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we Charlie?  I'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Beery! You got no beef there! He's good.  Hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat Jack Oakie. A stitch, Oakie. Funny stuff, funny stuff. But don't get me wrong – Beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. Wrestled some myself back in school. I guess you know the basic moves.
Hi, Charlie.
Seems like nothing but, lately.
In a few days. Out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – New York City. Things have gotten all balled up at the Head Office.
This kind of heat. It's pathetic.
I've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
You gotta believe me –
Hold on –
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
Yeah.
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
She's dead, Barton! If that was her name.
Charlie, I feel like I'm going crazy – like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what to do... I didn't do it, believe me. I'm sure of that, Charlie. I just...
Don't worry about that, compadre. I'll be back.
No no, Mr. Breeze has actually been a great help –
With all due respect, sir, I think it's the best work I've done.
Well, I'm going to be working here, mostly at night; I'm a writer. Do you have room service?
Huh?
Nine days – Tuesday –
Funny. As in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
You want my partner to kiss your ass?
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
You didn't tell us you knew the dame.
You two have some sick sex thing?
"Blood, Sweat, and Canvas".
She was there, wasn't she?
It's bullshit.  You know it is.
No?
No!  I'm working my tail off.  I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
Catherine Tramell.
I thought you hardly know her.
About a year and a half.
Only when they make interesting reading.
But you didn't hurt --
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
Everybody that I care about dies.
You paid $50,000 for your character?
Come over here and tell me no.
It won't sell.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
No.
Not now he don't.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Somethin', though.
What in the hell for?  You think I'm gettin' any at my age?  I don't like blue-haired women.  I don't like 'em.
You're my friend, Gus.
Catherine told me what was in it.
She said alone -- suite 405.  It ain't gonna take long.
What was it?
What about me?
No.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
Catherine Tramell.  Age 30.  No priors, no convictions.  Double major, magnum cum laude, Berkeley, 1980.  Literature and Psychology. Daughter, sole survivor -- Marvin and Elaine Tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, Catherine Tramell sole heir.  Estimated assets $110 million.
It's always how you would do it. This is my version.
You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime.
Why, so you could humiliate me?
As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
Everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors – anything with a SAMO tag on it.  The other day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: "Somebody's offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?"
Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me?
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
Yeah. I really blew it. I still think about her.
I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.
You name it, I paint there.
I know.
We don't hang them at home, y'know – just in the streets..
Is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
Should there be?
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Out?
Wanna bet? If you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
Willie Mays.
About what?
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
Hi Gina.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Guess I just got sick of him.
Why does everybody say that? He's the only person I know who doesn't need to use me.
Yeah, it's the best one.
It's three thousand dollars!
Wanna Mac?
You're a fast mover.
What? Life's beautiful. Depression isn't permanent. Don't you believe that?  What is it – did your girlfriend leave you?
No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.
Can you put me in the ring with him?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
A Phillips head. From the toolbox.
That's ignorant.
Vichyssoise.  Supposed to be cold, right?
I'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... Selina will probably be there ...
...four, five.
Seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Scare me?  No, actually, I was just scaring myself ...
I detest violence, but ... Christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
No darker than yours, Bruce.
Nor I, on the second.
Yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  Is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
It does to me.
Yawn.
A half-pint.  I'm talking gallons.
Either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
Huh?  You're implying I'm some kinda psycho criminal?
Oh, him again.  He's already history -- check it out.
Did I?  Only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  Corn dog!
Yes.  <u>Yes</u>.  Boyfriend trouble ..?
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
My god ... it's true.  The Penguin- Man of the sewers ... Please, don't h--
No, just give you a splitting headache.
Point is, listen to them.  They've lost faith in old symbols. They're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  If it works, don't fix it...
That's my name, Maximillions. Don't wear it out, babe, or I'll make you buy me a new one.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
Despite all your talents, you are still a novice in the ways of family. Dick follows the same ends as you but gets there by his own course.  You must learn to trust him.  For that is the nature of family.
Not all heroes wear masks.
I recognized the accent.
Whatever you say, lady.  It's all in a day's work for me.
Keep it.
Of course, Dick Grayson, ward of the fabulously wealthy Bruce Wayne. Why would you need a few hundred dollars?
What are you talking about?
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The sun beam won't work.
I hate being lectured.
The batcomputer tracks him heading for the Gotham Museum.
The new antiquities exhibit.  The Second Sun of the Sudan.
Bad, yes.  Guy, no.  This is one majorly beautiful evil person.
Umm-hmmmm.
That lab was consumed by fire last week.  how did you manage to escape?
I can't.  But perhaps tonight, over dinner...I've just had an opening.
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I wish I knew.
You left your back wide open.  Freeze could have killed you.
You know Alfred.  He'd never say Anything.  But I can tell.  Until you came along, Alfred was the only family I ever had.  Without him, I don't know how I would have survived.  He saved my life, Dick.  And I've never told him.
Talk to him, Bruce.  There's nothing worse than losing someone without telling them how you feel.
I checked the medical database.  No one else is even close.
Oh but I am.  For the first time in a long time.  I'm through living in your shadow.  All that ends right now.
Inspired, Ms. Ivy.
At you?  Polly want a kiss?
How about dangerous curves?
Then you never loved me?
Sorry to disappoint you.  But rubber lips are immune to your charms.
I wonder if she'd go out with me.
Apology hastily retracted.
Actually, he took the car.
He boosted the Jag?  Is that all?
Which `they' might that be, sir?
Jack Napier's dead. My parents are avenged. The Wayne Foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
What?
No demons, son.  Your monsters are here. Until you fact that, I fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
Let's just say I could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
I don't mind the work. Pity I can't see behind the mask.
That's usually my line.
Bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
Come on, Bruce. This is what I do for a living.
What?
You want me close but you won't let me near. What's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
Oh God, Bruce, you were a child. You weren't responsible.
I got no place at the circus without my family. I'm going to get a fix on Two-Face. Then I'm going to kill him.
Absolutely not.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
...The Box can change their lives.  Our stock coupons will spike.
...You gonna kill me?
Might. Might not. Could say we're of two minds on the subject.
Miss.
A miss. And my favorite vitamin, I might add.
You know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you'd have my apartment.
Which bathroom is that, sir?
Gosh, I could kill you, but then you'd miss my party. And you, Batman -- you're the guest of honor!
Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live.
... A hundred and eight?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
Better. It's not on the market yet.
I had to save you, Vicki. I --  -- Please trust me.
I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale.
In other words, what right do I have to talk about terror.
... Looks like a convention.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment.
We've told him we'll deal. What could he possible have to gain by --
They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. MOVE OUT!
Sorry.  We had another bat sighting.
What are you talking about?
What are you, scared of heights?
That ain't what I heard.  That ain't what I heard at all.  I heard the bat got him.
Do you want this money or don't you?  Now shut up!  Shut up --
Nobody wants a war, Carmine.  If we can't do business, we shake hands and part friends.
I'd like to read a prepared statement. 'While this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
Ten million dollars. Ten mi -- YOU CHEAPSKATES! I've just wiped out the stock market. I've cost you billions!  I want ten million and one.
... Behind the makeup?
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Likes to kill? KNOX  Women find him magnetic.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What were you thinking?
Yeah?  According to this, he's in Geneva from '76 to '79. Well, I called Geneva.  Nobody there's even heard of the guy - - Probably off in Tibet with some kung fu master.
What do you say? Let's head for the lights.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
Holy shit. Holy...
Yeeees?
I said I'd check with you.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
I had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
I was sort of half way through the sentence in which I would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
About Charles...
It was nothing.  We're not ... He just makes me laugh.  When was the last time we laughed?  Any of us?
No, I'm fine.
Annie, it's me.
No, Annie, no.  This is Doctor Bean. He's going to be working with us.
Excuse me.
She's ... well, she's good.
Right.  Got it.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Er ... pray tell me why?
Mmmmm...
There's a man.  I woke up next to a man ...
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
Well, there is that ...
You.
This sucks.
Uh... Buuuuut. Boot. Someone named boot.
Me first?
Huh huh. No way, dude.
Heh heh. Thank God.
Yeah, heh heh. Damn right!
Heh hmm heh heh.
This desert is stupid. They need to put a drinking fountain out here.
Huh huh. Jack. Huh huh.
What's your problem Beavis?
Uh hey, does anyone wanna see my unit?
Butt-snatch...
Uh... dill, um, face...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Yeah, I'm hoping to do some sluts too. Heh heh. Do they have lots of sluts in Las Vegas?
Um, um, yeah, probably. Heh heh.
Chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving Dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
Where did these guys come from?
Holed up. Huh huh huh. Holed.
Yup. Huh huh.
Well, then you know what I'm talking about. Anyway, here's the story. I scored with these two chicks. True story.
Oh, Adam, the model looks so good. The Historical Society will love it.  You've finished the streets?
Adam!
Yeah it turned out okay.  We applied for a National Historical plaque for it.  That'll be the third one on Main Street.
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some coffee.  You get some more firewood.
What?
... Hmmm?
Yes it did.  Yes it did.  I made a couple of small discoveries. Here's one.
This book isn't arranged that way. What do you want to know?
That's my girl!
I don't know if there's anything we can do.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
Then it should be here.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
He might have hurt somebody.
Little black party dresses?
I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>.  It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
You don't know the Deetzes very well, do you?  My father bought this place.  He never walks away from equity.  Why don't <u>you</u> leave?
Really.  I don't know.
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not that it matters to your type.  But there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  I'd say three hours.
We're...
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  Just look at Amityville.  He was one of my boys.  Didn't have to give that one any lessons. From day one... But I must be off ... I've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
Forget him.  He'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  You need to worry about people like <u>Otho</u>.  There are a lot of phony trance mediums.  They usually can't make the formulas work, but if Otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  As in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
No, wait!
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
Of course they're dead.  They're ghosts.
Where'd they go?
The happy hunting ground.  Who cares?
Yeah.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.

Your qu...?  But you're...
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget it.  You can't get her out of Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
We're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... The Goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. Should have it fumigated too.  I saw a fly today.
Lydia.  Try to be civil.  I'm going to see if I can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
Yes.  Except when you creep around in your mother's --
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
Gooood!
That's Charles' study.  But you don't have to even look in there. He'll love whatever you do to it.  He's such a sheep.
She's been without therapy up here and I will not allow her to ruin...
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
I'll need something personal of theirs.
As flies the lizard Serpent fell; As goblin vizard, At the spell Of pale wizard, Sinks to hell; The buried, dead, and slain... Rise again.
But not for long...
Yes.
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, I will.
It's fine today, Robert.
He does, does he?
Yes, Robert. I have seen it before. It happens to old people.
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
At times, yes. But that's not an uncommon reaction to such an accident. Actually, I found him to have quite a sense of humor.
No, Eve... I'm sorry.
Well, he said it was his, he walked us through it.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
No sir, I don't believe I do.
I agree.
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Yes.
I am a very good gardener.
Thank you, Eve - I like this house very much.
He does...?
Yes.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Yes, so do we.
So am I, Eve.
Hello, Eve.
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
Thank you, Eve.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I like to watch.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
I don't want Robert.
Yes, I agree, I think so too.
Yes, I understand.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Oh, good.
Yes, it is very good!
Yes. I like that name very much.
We must speak again, Mr. Gardiner, many times!
Yes. I like that very much.
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Oh, I see.
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Yes. I like to watch very much.
... Sir?
I never needed money.
Very good.
Yes sir. I'll take care of that.
I see.
... I see.
I hope so.
I am a very serious gardener.
You live here?  ... We don't have any record of that.
... Joe? Who's Joe?
Come now, Mr. Jennings had been bedridden for thirty-five years, since he fractured his spine.
Correct.
... Skip the levity, Kinney - what have you got?
No headaches?
Do you feel well enough for that?
Of course... I'm so sorry for you, Eve...
Look, Johanna...
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
It's so good to see you too, Ben, you look terrific!
Yes, I did.
You take care too, Bobby.
Oh yeah, he's good.
Yeah.
Tell your friends.
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Which one is Elijah again?
Hmmm.
Hi.
What?
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
Fuck Maxine.
We?
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Simulates?
Money, Miss Warts?
I'm afraid I... have no idea what you are saying... you bastard!
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
Yessir.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Emily Dickinson.
Why not?
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Yeah. But enough about me.
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
No.
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Tickets to Malkovich?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
Ha ha ha!
If there was any way I could go in your place. But I'm only a monkey and...
Two hundred dollars, please.
A scary dream?
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Gehginnis ondah foam?
Someone names A Lot of Warts on line two.
It's my job to ask the questions. Yours to answer them.
I'm sure you're not going crazy.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
Ouch. Now that's hot. She's using you to channel some dead lesbian lover. Let me know when you're done with her. This is my type of chick.
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
Count me in.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs.  Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
Maxine...
One hour.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy-boy.
Oh, Lotte...
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
No one would ever have to know its not him.
Sleepy suddenly.
You've got to be kidding.
Captain Mertin, surely I am a God-fearing Christian woman like yourself, but alas, I am afraid that the world was not built with me in mind. Door knobs are too high, chairs are unwieldy, high-ceilinged rooms mock my stature. Nor am I a marrie lady, Captain. after all, who would marry a person of my diminutiveness? So I am forced to work for my few pennies a week as an optometrist. Why cannot there be a place for me to work safe and comfortable?
Say the Word!
You saying nothing counts?
I'm saying they came into my yard.
You can't do that, Baby. It ain't right.
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
YOU NEVER FORGOT ME?
YOUR FACE IS MINE.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
You think she sure 'nough your sister?
Yes sir
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
In case of what?
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
The church!
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
She scares me. I scare me. And that girl in her house scares me.
What? What? You talking back to me?
What do you think?
Visiting friends of hers in Palm Springs.  Just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.
You don't know shit, Lebowski.
The Gundersons.
The?  Who the fff--
Yeah, it sucks.
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.
This is a hundred and eighty dollars.
And this guy peed on it.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT!  This Chinaman is not the issue, Dude.
What the fuck is he talking about?
This Saturday.  Quintana and--
WELL THEY CAN FUCKING UN-POST IT!
What's that, Walter?
Went alright.  Dude's car got a little dinged up--
No--
Well--
Shut the fuck up, Donny.  Not a bunch of fig-eaters with towels on their heads tryin' to find reverse on a Soviet tank.  This is not a worthy--
--had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man--
Far from it.
Let's say a 10% finder's fee?
Oh yeah?
Right, but let me explain something about that rug--
I was talking about my rug.
If you successfully do so, I will compensate you to the tune of 1% of the recovered sum.
A hundred.
Hey man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?  You might learn something.  Now I got--
Well--yeah, I guess--
Bunch of assholes.  And then, you know, little of this, little of that. My career's, uh, slowed down a bit lately.
Huh?  He's fucking loaded.
I want a child.
Jeff Lebowski.  Come on.  This other Jeffrey Lebowski.  The millionaire. He's gonna be easier to find anyway than these two, uh. these two  . . . And he has the wealth, uh, the resources obviously, and there is no reason, no FUCKING reason, why his wife should go out and owe money and they pee on your rug.  Am I wrong?
Huh?  Oh--Cynthia's Pomeranian. Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.
What the fuck are you--
What do you mean "brought it bowling"? I didn't rent it shoes.  I'm not buying it a fucking beer.  He's not gonna take your fucking turn, Dude.
Mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.
No, you're not wrong--
Well, just take 't easy, man.
Huh?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.
Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.  It's your roll.
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
It is a fucking game.  You said so yourself, Dude--she kidnapped herself--
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
Terrific, Walter.  But you haven't told me how we get her back.  Where is she?
Huh?
What the fuck're you talking about? That poor woman--that poor slut-- kidnapped herself, Dude.  You said so yourself--
I told that fuck down at the league office-- who's in charge of scheduling?
It's been stolen, Walter!  You fucking know it's been stolen!
Someone else's--where the fuck are they gonna--
Now Dude--
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot!
All but one man died?  There at Bitter Creek?
Fucking Arthur Digby Sellers wrote 156 episodes, Dude.
Just ask him if he--ask him about the car, man!
You're going to enter a world of pain, son.  We know that this is your homework.  We know you stole a car--
THEN WHY CAN'T YOU--fuck, never mind, just call Donny then, and ask him to--
What's your point, Dude?
Yeah?  What do you think happens when you get divorced?  You turn in your library card?  Get a new driver's license?  Stop being Jewish?
Uh-huh.
That's fuckin' combat.  The man in the black pyjamas, Dude.  Worthy fuckin' adversary.
Come on, Walter!.
Well they were looking for you, these two guys, they were trying to--
So you know they were trying to piss on your rug--
Is this a--what day is this?
I'll tell you what I'm blathering about!  I got information--new shit has come to light and--shit, man! She kidnapped herself!
Well, you have your story, I have mine.  I say I entrusted the money to you, and you stole it.
Walter!
Stay away from me, mister!
He's all yours. And I'm not your partner.
What the hell are you doing, Blade?
He escaped.  You didn't tell me they were immune to silver and garlic.
Fry 'em.
What?
I don't think so.
Why?
Spare me the race card, OJ.  We're not going out into the sun.  It's too risky.
From his father, of course.
They've made contact with the Reapers.
Any game worthy of being played is.  One must be patient.  In this way, I have outlived my enemies.  All of them.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
I was backpacking.  Hooked up with these two chicks who were off to see the Burning Man festival.  We were gonna take "E", have ourselves a little freeball out in the desert.  You know the riff, "Dear Penthouse, I never thought this would happen to me, but --"
It's not worth the risk. We can't trust her.
Oh, so it's back to pretending we're human again, is it? Spare me the Uncle Tom routine. You can't keep denying what you are. You're one of us, Blade. You always have been.
You don't have a few minutes, Frost.
You're blind --
I didn't come here to get my palms read. I need something translated.
I don't care what you believe. I saved your life once, I don't plan on making a habit of it. You want my advice, you'll be out of the city by nightfall. If you're stupid enough to stay, that's your business.
Do it. You'll be dead before you can file the complaint.
How can you tell?
The way they move, they way they smell --
How long have we been driving?
We get out of this alive, maybe I'll take that miracle cure of yours.
For them. But for me --
Maybe it's time to start exploring other alternatives.
You're wasting your breath, woman. He can't hear you now. It's the Thirst, you see? It already has him in its grip.
Eventually. He toyed with them first. He made me choose, do you understand? Which order they would die in --
Frost's bodycount keeps rising, and I'm not getting any younger, am I?
I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--<u>I</u> killed it--
Something was wrong.
Buried deep under 200 years worth of soil, ash, and compost layers.
What is <u>this</u>?
--<u>whoever</u>--they built an entire house <u>around</u> a <u>tree</u>. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
It was <u>free</u>--I recall that was the chief selling point for you.
You feel no need to get married or anything.
Get your goddamn--
--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
--what're you saying?? I didn't have anything to do with--
--no one'll ever know.
I want amphetamines.
Both. Now.
My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
Turn the tapes back on.
Back it up, rewind, whatever you call it.
--which'd be about ten bucks--
That's what Josh and Mike said.
Hadn't even opened the thing since Cub scouts.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
Try a long walk.
What're you, nuts?
What're you doing with all this shit?
Too busy eating us?
Just go.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
No idea--goddamitt!
--I don't know.
The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
--before you lose your emotional lunch.
--who?
Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
The wheel.
It's a <u>serious</u> sociological study.
First enormous brick warehouse on your right.
Sorry, I didn't think we were making that much noise.
I think it's time to get out of here.
Ah, Domini?
Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn <u>doctor</u>.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
You're needed here--keep watching--
--fuck Anna!
He's in a meeting. Could I have him--
Abby...
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
What was that?
Uh-huh. So how do you know it was a he?
Yeah? What happened?
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
Ray?... What time is it?
I didn't think I could sleep. I'm surprised you could. Are you all right?
In the trunk.
I think someone's watching.
You won't have to. I just wanted to see if you knew.
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
I don't know... I just think maybe I'm making a mistake...
Sign.
I don't particularly want to talk to you.
Well what?
What do you think?
...What?
Yeah...
It's taken care of. The less you know about it the better.
You said the usual--
Red Label.
Right. Sorry.
No. I think I'll stay right here in hell.
Yeah, well, I may be getting in over my head here, I mean you're the geologist, but my theory for what it's worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it's the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of TNT?  Enough to light Las Vegas for how long?  How many years? Course, I'm no mathematician but--
Okay honey. that sounds nice. Jeffrey. I think you've got termites in the house.
If you like Frank. Here's to your fuck. cheers.
He's alright, I guess. I hope. They're doing tests, that's why I'm home from school. I was over at the hospital this morning and I was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind Vista, I found an ear.
Come on. I'll drive you home. It's on my way.
Why do you do it?
It's blue. blue velvet.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
Who knows you have these?
Yes sir.
He's comin' back?. What for?
Yeah.
You tell me!! Let me see that wallet.  Jeffrey Beaumont. What're you doing in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?
I was. an experiment. Just to see if I could do it.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I . I don't know.
I looked for you in my closet tonight.  It's crazy, I don't know where you came from but. I like you.
I'm doing it.
I'm glad you do.
You called me Jeffrey.
HELP HIM!! Promise me you'll help him!
You seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with Dorothy Vallens.
Yeah. I guess I did.  What's going to happen to me?
I'll send you straight to hell, Fuck!
Good, let's drink up.
Am I bothering you?
Where are they?
Thanks for the tour. It was nice talking to you.
Yeah. Good bye.
Just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
Alright.
No. I only saw his back. He went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
Pretty clever. Are you game for more?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date. that does that.
Yeah. but.
O.K.
I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well.  Maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what I mean?
He got a little jealous.
I'm sorry, I didn't.
You saw a lot in one night.
Okay. okay.
Goodnight.
Shoot.
Yes. is that so surprising?. Yeah I worry. a lot. I got you into this.
You didn't tell him about me?
... You look beautiful.
NO.
Yes.
OK. Let's get her over to your father's.
uh uh.
.Jeffrey!. Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Of course, Jeffrey.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Would you like a piece of cake?
You can change it if you want to.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
He what?
I don't know.  Drunk somewhere.  Try the bar.  And if you find her, tell her to come, it's almost midnight.
Dejen la maricada pues!  No jodan! Nadie va a matar a nadie!  George, debemos hablarle al Patron, es la unica manera, mano.
What is?
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
It's garbage.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
No, I cam here out of my own volition.
Excuse me?
Something about vengance being best served cold.
You.  Your responsibility is over.  You do not fly.  You are not a pilot.  You are not a distributor.  You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane.  That is all.  You make a percentage.  A generous one.  And you're lucky to get that.
No.
Goodness is right.  If you do the math, that's over thirty grand a week profit. I want you to be my partner on this, Derek.  Fifty-fifty.  That's fifteen thousand a week for you, my friend.  In your pocket, free and clear.
It's great and everything, but what am I going to do with all this?
I heard.
For calling you a homo.
Oh hey, one more thing?
Me, too.  Too much blah, blah, blah, blah is no good.  But we are roommates, okay?  And we must talk to each other. I am arrested for stealing cars.  For the grand theft auto.  Okay?  So, now it is your turn.  Now you will tell me, okay?  You will tell me why you are here?
Never mind.  Not for you to worry.
I thought you said we were roommates. That we should talk about everything.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Don't worry.  We will talk of everything.  We have the time.  You arrive here with a Bachelor of Marijuana, but you will leave with a Doctorate of Cocaine.
Perfect, George.  Perfect.  Everything is fine down here.  Everything is all set up.
I just got released five minutes ago.
We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
I think it's fair to say you underestimated the market there, Derek.
Try the closet.
George, we've got sixty-one million dollars.  It's either here or someplace else.  We've got to put it somewhere. Unless you want to launder it.
And keep only forty-percent?  No thanks.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Yeah.  We heard all about it.  I want you to know I'm deeply sorry about your girlfriend.
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
I'm just happy that George has found someone he cares for.
Power?
Family.
And Diego?
You know why I'm here.  You know what I have to do.  I came here for permission. Out of respect, Pablo.  This is bullshit, he's making me look like a punk.
...and the winds of destiny carry you aloft...
You're not going to trial?
What about him?
No thanks, fellas.  You've got the wrong fucking guy.  I'm not a rat.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
Oh fucking relax.  Let your hair down for once.  It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes.  You're such a fucking pussy.  I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
What?
You knew I was seeing Kristina, right?
Kristina's fine.
Is she here?  Is she coming?
How are you doing?
What do you want from me?
Yeah.
No.  I just kind of like the sound of it.
I didn't mean to...
I know, Dad.  I know...
But I want to put her name on the list for tomorrow.  My daughter.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Marijuana is illegal in my country, and I believe in yours, as well.  We must be careful.
That's right.
Second district ... Explain better ...
Third group. What's your assignment?
My name is Kader, Ali ... Saari Kader ... In other words, in order to join the organization, you had to undergo a test. I could have told you to murder the barman, but he's an Algerian ... and the police would let you kill him, even though he is one of theirs. By obeying such an order, you still could have been a double agent. And that's why I told you to kill the French policeman: because the French wouldn't have let you do it. If you were with the police you wouldn't have done it.
What's important for me is that you let me risk my life for nothing.
C'mon ... you're exaggerating. The orders were to shoot him in the back.
Then don't complain.
But Kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.
It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
But it's not even midnight yet!
Good evening, sir.
A name?
No. Let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. But from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. By now the game is over. The NLF has been defeated.
Okay, I'll make the statement in writing ...
No -- but I got something.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
What about the will?
But there's more?
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?
Increase his heart rate.
You name it -- they argued about it. Mr. Marsh tried his best to keep her happy -- but it seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough for her.
Why didn't the State's investigation uncover Mr. Roston earlier?
Take your pole out of the water, Frank.  The fish ain't biting today.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Yeah.  Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
Objection.  Your Honor, we don't know where this tape is from.  Who made it -- or under what circumstances it was made.
Her.  It's an obvious move.  I'm building a case against her, remember?
Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the defendant for many months.  I feel that his opinion is valid in substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.
Why did you come by?
What about Miss Lawson?
Did you talk about Miss Lawson?
He did everything he could to take care of his heart?
She didn't.  She just left.
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality.  Sometimes I felt she could read my mind.  It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted.  A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me.  She had handcuffed me to the bed.
Thank you.  The State rests.
Well -- I realized that she wasn't interested in me.  She was just trying to get information out of me.
You called him?
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Oriental medicine.
One last question, Doctor.  If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
Do you remember his exact words?
There was an inquiry.  It was his word against mine.  They believed him.  I was fired.
What changed?
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
Because you were jealous.  Because he cut you out of the will.  Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
Yes.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
No -- it just doesn't look right.
That's not an answer.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
It won't be that hard.
I broke my ankle skating.  That ended that dream.
I went out on the boat.
Honey.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me.  After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in.  That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
I love you too, Dad.
Why?
I am relaxing.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
Where have you been?
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Please -- not now.
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
No, it's not.  Now I get to pitch.
We were here two Christmases ago.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Lawyer here?
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Michael.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
I'd laugh first then I'd kill them. Make sure they heard me laughing.
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, shut up! It's the woman who's in control of these situations. Men don't know which end is up till a woman points.
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
You want me to call the doctor?
Maybe it's because I live here.
Oh. When did you move back?
No, really?
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
We got engaged.
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is...  ... so much beauty.
What?
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Woman friends, too?
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
But it's not the same.
What made you ask such a question?
Okay. See you later.
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage.  Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or... 
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Couple. Want to help?
Yes, that'd be nice.
Have you ever been to that station?
Near the church.
Yes, thanks.
What?
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
What about us? What about me?
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Kinda pretty. Is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Hmm?
Okay.
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Take my advice.  Get the hell out of there.  It's a bad place.  Always has been.
Take who where?  What you smokin'?
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
What the hell you talking about?
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Or just Hell-adjacent...
Those 'fools' are my people.
Sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
Hush, baby.
Go easy on Jay Bird.  I can remember when we was his age...
Maybe once upon a time.  But that was long ago.  Back before... before it became what it is.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
That place is already bad luck.
Why?
Don't worry about it.  I'll stay with the boys.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
You'll take care of it?  Not this time. No way.  I bought it fair and square. And we open tonight.
You could have had it done.  You didn't want us there.
I wouldn't have risked killing you to get you out.  I was trying to protect you.
Don't call me that.
Keep your hands to yourself, willya?
You better hope not.  Cause it's like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
Now you.
Oh, no.  Please don't make me go by myself.  I'm scaaaaaaaaaared.
It was just like in my head.
I was born near here.  My dad's from here.  He never mentioned it.
"This is Patrick..."  "...And this is Patrick on crack." Imagination, my butt.  Even the space cowboy can't...
Why not?  He eats everything else.
Know what?
I think you're fucking crazy!
You're a dead man!  A fucking dead man!
Gimme the gun.
Give it to me.
Ummm ...  in the linen closet.
But you know he did it.
So what?!  So fucking what?  Use your head, Violet.  The money is gone.  Gino is coming here to get it.  You think he's going to believe me if I tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  Is that what you think? I don't.  You know what I think?  I think I'm a dead man.  I'm one in the brain.  That's what I think!
But it could be anywhere.
Caesar, this is crazy.
What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money.
Shut up, Violet!
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
Good idea.
Another time.
Sure.
I thought I heard someone knocking.
We went over to Johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, Bad.
Where in the hell is he?
Gunfire?  Is this a joke?
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
I told Bianchinni I would take a look.  Is it that sink?
...  yes.
He's a launderer?
Nothing.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
I suppose he just wants to watch.
He was in love with you, right?
For what?
I am, but ...
Johnnie?
Why?
That's his brother.
Yeah.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
An accident.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on.
I was so afraid you ...
Pop?
Hey, Johnnie ...
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt?
I don't know what we're talking about.
Yes, well, I think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
...it's a problem...
I think so.
What do they want me to do?
What did I do?  I spent thirty million dollars on you.  I spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  What did I do?  What in the name of God have you been doing, Jason?
Of course.  We had to try.  We didn't know what was wrong.  We didn't know you were in trouble.
I have some very bad news for you, sir.  I'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but Monsieur Kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
I don't want anything but a ride. All I want to do is go home.
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
Thanks for the ride.
-- we can go -- I can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
No.
Nykwana Wombosi. 
What does that mean?  Jason, what does that mean?  Jason, please...who is he?
I don't know. 
What?
I won't let that happen.
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
Abbott wants to talk.
Maybe it's a game.  Maybe he's trying to send us a message.
That'll solve all our problems.
-- we're evacuating the building --
<u>Where am I</u>?
How did I get here?
Thank you.
... fix themselves.
...ampered. with it, Spoor.
What? How do you know my name?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
It's reply paid.
Yes, I know. It's the backlog, everybody complains. Was it all right otherwise?
Do you mind if I use your bathroom?
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Thank you, David ... and a very merry Christmas to you all.
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Even later.
Are you officer 412/L?
B58/732, that's A. Buttle isn't it?
No, no, I don't. I'm just beginning Honestly. Sorry, carry on.
Look, about the Layton woman - maybe she's just trying to help the Buttle family.
You mean you're going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
Well, I ... Good point. What do you suggest?
Take her off the list.
I'm sorry, Sam, I'm afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
She's innocent, Jack --- she's done nothing wrong.
You don't really think Tuttle and the girl are in league?
There are no coincidences, Sam. Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  This whole Buttle/Tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. Bye bye.
Sam - we've always been close, haven't we?
Jack ...
Stamped?
Information Adjustments.
You've just said yourself, Miss, we've already stamped it. Why should we stamp it twice?
Them?
What?
Where are you taking me?
What parcel?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
What do you mean? Would you rather have terrorists?
Well, all wars do -
Who is this war against, Sam?
Turn around!
No. Please. They're going to arrest you.
"Lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... Do you think anyone's hurt?
Are you still following me?
Go away.
........... It's a bomb isn't it?
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Send it to somebody else. Send it to Buttle. It's his cheque.
Here.
I delivered it.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
Yes ... No ... I don't, know.
I'll bring it back in ten minutes.
{suddenly unctious) Oh, but of course ...
Um ...
Thank you, Spiro. Shirley, what are you going to have?
Thank you or calling Central Services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, Central Services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
Thank you for calling Cen -
What? Who is this?
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
Madam ... CUT to WOMAN turning, half in flirtatious conversation. It is SAM's MOTHER, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of SAM's Dream Girl.
What do they want you or?
Pregnant.
Thanks for the translation.  What's your name? Nombre?
That's the stuff. I call it the Red Lion. Very king-of-the-jungle.
You're going to live.
I usually don't do calls before coffee. But I think it might do you some good.  Twelve Young is here and I'm gonna take care of you, baby. Don't you worry about a thing, yahear, cause Marcus is alive and on arrival.
He's going to be all right, right?
No, I'd better not.
Yeah?
Music. I think it helps if you play something he liked.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
He's dead, huh?
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
Okay.
They're fine. My old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--I was sort of born to it, I guess.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
It'll be a while before he's up and running again.
It can always get worse. You can't change what's out there, only where you're coming from. You got to let the Lord take over, in here. 
Where the guy jumped and you almost fell. No, you never told me that story.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
God help us, he's hungry too.
What's that, Frank?
Three legs.
He was tough. You did all you could.
Yeah. Great, isn't it?
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
C'mon, look at your screen. Give up some blood!
You want some bum in the bus terminal? We'll wait for a real call.
Frank!
Don't push it, Larry.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
Yeah, you're right.
You write this?
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
You've made my dreams silly.
You have the job you have...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
No?
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
They booted me out of Washington.
London.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
Yes.
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Ravenous homosexual.
A half hour in the lobby.
Okay.  I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Okay, that's very easy.  Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
Yes.
Just blunt talk, okay?  I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Take care, Paul.  It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Well, you always want to give the credit away, do you?
Yes, there is.
And Bobbie says...
Yes.  That's right.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Okay.
That actually goes on...
So great -- right?
Hey?
You  make me nervous.  Anyway if I can pick your brain --
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Why, you need me for the story?
We can go together.
Because you're nuts.
I'd like to know.  I'll go along.
How can you say that to me?
I got promoted for things like that.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.  What do you think?  Never mind what you think.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
What's it called?
Yeah it was all just an accident.
Uh, well, I'm a little nervous, I never did a person before.
There there...
Thank you.
Jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
Oh sure, let's string along poor Walter, see how far it will take us!
Forget it.
I've been thinking...  Carla, would you do one favor for me?
What's this sauce!  I'm lactose intolerant.
Don't ask.
That's the idea, Walter.  It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
I do the research.
I saw a statue once called The Third Time Phyllis Saw Me She Exploded.
Looks like that cat paid off in spades.
What is it, your laundry?
Yes they are, aren't they?  Look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
Have a seat -
I-I already got a new one!
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Yeah, why?
It was.
You made...a bust... WALTER  Yeah isn't it wonderful?
Uh, sure.
You are?
You're coming downtown with me, Walter.  You're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or I swear to God I'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! Are we understanding each other?
NO! NO DON'T SHOOT ME I DON'T WANT TO GET SHOT!
I worked in one of them.  Back in Alaska. 
I see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
I don't!  But fifty thou?  That's not money, that's manna!
What do you get?
Really?
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Oh, OK.
T-tell him that?
I'm always alone, Mrs. Swicker, you know that.
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
The other two -- the new ones. Where are they?
Amazing!
Utterly.  Let's bail this town. It's getting... I don't know.  Let's go somewhere where there aren't any rich bitches.
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
It's the news, Buffy.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
Mmmnkay.
I do?  I guess I do.
'Bye.
I thought we were meeting here.
Is that your car?
Water.  Okay.
Oh, I'll be fine.  Got my chair, got my window, I'm great.
You know, you saved my life.  And I just wanted to say... I forgive you for talking during the movie. Almost.
Cool.  I could actually use a couple of Allen wrenches.  What do you need?
I'm glad you came.
Get away from me!
Like my homework.
Where?
To bring you... your birthright.
Time to do what?
Oh, my God.  I never told anybody about this.  I remember the one about the peasant, too.  God, there's a bunch.  Is this, like channeling or something.
Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
I have cheerleading squad.
Why do you keep saying that?
A Vampire-King?  You mean like Dracula?
Oh, yes.  And the man from your dreams.  Lothos.
In a way, yes.  Your fate is inexorably connected to them.
We're going to have the work hard. You'll need some excuse for staying out.  For your parents.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
Oh.
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
You are such a wet.
And why are you always wearing black? It's so down.  It's totally not your color.  I don't think you have a color.
I wish you would.
Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend.  It interferes with the work, and it...
And it makes it worse when I die, right?
Merrick.  You made a joke.  Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down?  I know it hurts the first time.
Because you clash, Merrick.  You clash with everything.  I mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'Slayers trained her.'  Honestly, you look like something out of... Pasadena.
All right.
They don't even have Dolby.
Have you guys seen Jeffrey?  The limo never showed, I thought he might be here.
My parents have money...
Are we so strange?  So alien to you?  I've seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it's truly heartwarming.  The perfect place to spread my empire.  Honestly, Eastern Europe was so dead, the Communists just drained the blood out of the place.  It's livened up a bit in the past few years, but it's nothing compared to this.... this Mecca of consumption.  The city of Angels.
Really?
Ever since Adam and Eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. Satan.  He sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his Hell on our earth.  They are a plague upon us.
Good.
Probably was.  What do you suppose she was doing out there.
Throw it out.
What is she...
Can't they make exceptions?  Maryanne Heinel?  She's such a scud.  Can't we have a Maryanne clause?
Oh, please!  When she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? Was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did I blink?
You're so out of it.  You've blown off cheerleading, you've blown off dance committee --
Okay!  Look, Buffy.  You want to play house with the unwashed masses, that's fine.  But personally, I think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  I really do.
Hey.  What should I do if I see Benny?
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
I know what it is.
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
I think you're real cute.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy.  a young, wild,
Aren't we all?
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
I doubt that.
What's so great about baseball?
Why not?
There  might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
Annie---
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
He'll learn.
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
Will that work for me?
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that?  Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
He did know.
Yep.
Naw...
By the dozen.  Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies--  I'm through with one night stands.
You're through with one night stands?!  What do you want?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
C ' mon!
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
You fuck!
My right.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Love to--
Shut up--I like this song...  April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
She's playing with my mind.
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it.  I gotta run--
Struck out eighteen...
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Don't tell him I told you--he'd break my neck.
Why are you doing this to me?
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
What do you propose?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
No, it's - it'll just be a couple of minutes. We got other things to do too, you know. He'll hurry her up. How's everything else besides this?
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here.
Hey, little Dale Evans.
Yeah, is this Lester? This is Sam...
...Rothstein. I want to talk to Ginger. Put her on the phone.
Right back.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
Okay.
Help, Daddy!
I don't know.
Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night.
Wait a sec, Nicky, Nicky, Nicky. Ta- take it easy.
Hey.
Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.
Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit.
Thanks, pal.
All right.
Nope, there's no way.
In other words, I'm fucked.
All right.
Now, what does she have to do with all this?
A week ago it was my business, now it's none of my business. In other words, when you need me to take care of somethin' for you, then you need me.
Don't ask questions. Just be there.
What people?
Your fuckin' ass! You could have had the food and beverage job without goin' on television!  You wanted to go on TV.
No, it - it - Nicky, when you asked me if you could come out here, what did I tell you? I mean, you asked me, and I knew you were going to come out no matter what I said, but what did I tell you? Do you remember what I told...
Back -
Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both.
And what'd she want?
Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
How'd you know I was here?
I'll be right there.
Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor.  Thank you for your time.
I'll come by.
Come on. There we go. Look at that. Beautiful.
Hello, Jennifer, it's Sam -
What can I do?
Why is she eight pounds over?
Here we go. Good luck.
He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Oh...
You get her?  Okay.  Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Yeah, how do I know?
Okay, okay.
Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff.
Right.
Pretty serious.
...twenty-five thousand?
Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch.
Yeah.
At the most, which is impossible for him.
She had the same.
Oh...
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
Don't you threaten me!
Who knows what you're gonna do in there? I don't want you -
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
We all have a past. You have a past, I have a past. And my past is no worse than yours. But you guys think you have the right to pass judgement on me.
Long suspected of running the Tangiers without...
Shoot, it's gotta be in the millions, maybe more.
Well, it happened so quick. Three guys won. I didn't have a chance to call you.
I really think you're -
You - Wait! You didn't see that you were being set up on the second win?
You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it?
A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?!
Shut your mouth!
You shut up.
Oh, listen, I understand that there's always a risk... you know, I might have to take a loss somewhere.
Well, you gotta understand, I'm giving you fifty thousand cash.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
And here. Here.
She's on the account. There's nothing we can do.
Now move along.
Fuckers!
Carmine's gone.
I'm over here now.
Uh-huh.
Calm down! Calm down!
We're placing you under arrest for aiding and abetting -
Fine, fine.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
What're you gonna do?
What could I say? I knew if I gave the wrong answer, I mean, Nicky, Ginger, Ace, all of 'em could've would up gettin' killed.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
All right.
No. I - I'm just curious, you know. I was wonderin' how much he would put into a thing like that. That's all.
Well, there you go. But what does that tell ya? A million dollars in jewelry. Does that tell you the guy is crazy about you, or what?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
All right?
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
You know?
Yeah.  Boy, he really fucked himself up out here -  - didn't he?
Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this.  Don't cry.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it.
Yes.
That's right.
Right.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Listen...
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
Come here, come here.
This peter's a motherfucker.
I took care of everybody.
...to a tee. Like the time Tony Dogs...
Angelo and Buster.
Yeah.
Take him out! Take this motherfucker out!
This motherfucker, do you believe this? Two fuckin' days and nights!  Fuck me?
Charlie M? You make me pop your fuckin' eye out of your head to protect that piece of shit? Charlie M? You dumb motherfucker!
Kill me, you fuck, kill me.
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Oh, sorry -
I'm sorry.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings?
Ayy!  Some cat's blocking the periscope.  Somebody, give it a swat...
This looks promising...
Yeah, all those women who went feline this afternoon...They're so ashamed now..
Guilty. I am.
Nothing, just a jolt of deja-vu. I think I went out with a guy with a dignified British butler--can't remember how it turned out..
I'll bet the butler's name wasn't "Jeff."
Stop. We are not having a "duality" conversation. "Ooh, he has a secret side.  Ooh, she has a dark side." Please.  Duality is a joke. You get one, do you understand me?  You get one life. One shot. I'm so tired of women saying "I have an inner strength" or "Deep down, I'm really ambitious." "One day I'll design my own line of clothing and write children's stories, if I can only remember to return the videos I rented last night." If you are something, then you better be out there doing something.  You need to be the same bold thing in the day that you are at night--with maybe a slight clothing change. There is no gray area. The truth is not somewhere in between. There are two sides to every personality, all right--the reality...and the lie. We are not having a "duality" conversation.
Somewhere very far away, very quiet, and very...  This is all wonderful, Selina, but...But I'm afraid I can not rest until all my sister's killers are brought to justice...That one-armed monster..
Can I just say what a classy touch the neon urinals are, Mr. Architect?  I just love risking electrocution every time I..
Your uniform, that first time I saw you, was a ghastly cage I vowed to unlock in order to..
I've been looking for you.  Selina Kyle was right. One of us is a psychotic crusader.
What little boy doesn't?
Priceless...We have a showdown in this alley, right?
Just hold on!  I'm not done. There are two kinds of men in the world, Selina. In Category A, you have Me. In Category B is everyone who wants to be in Category A, but are too afraid, too weak..!
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
Pass!
What about "climbing in?"
Touchy. Look everybody, it's Casper, the friendly crimefighter...
That is not a man, Captain God. That is Vomit accidentally born with two legs.
I know how you feel, humiliated in the hands of a woman. I'd rather eat my soul on a paper plate...
Oh, I like her. I like her a lot. I want to save this one for later. Something that tasty you don't eat all at once. Go back to your alter- egos, we'll regroup in the morning.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
It's a lot more fun than fighting violence with pamphlets. That voicebox of yours is a hoot. Say "I'm wearing no underwear"--it'll be funny..  You do know you're evil, don't you?
The Mission is happening tonight..It's up to you to...to save the City...
You know, my name's not Spooky. It's, it's Rachel.
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
Enough.
I thought you'd like a ride to work.  You don't own a cat, do you?
About the same. Thanks for asking...Damn blender.  Okay, I can't stand it anymore, I'm dying to know--Did you try on some whiskers last night and hit a 7-11 along with all those other women? You had to have thought about it--a Catwoman for a night?
I said I saw you last night. What were you doing hiding in that alley, running off when the superhero alarm sounded...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
Oh, so now even the keepers of the city don't meet your standards...You're late.
Trust me, you won't have to.
Don't you have children?
Me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
I'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  Get this door open!
They'll wait.  Meantime, raise the lid.
You got it wrong.  I'm the one that's on your side.
With all those holes Nels pumped in I knew you wouldn't suffocate.
Not this minute.
That's what I deserve for listening in the first place.
I'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  Are you there yet?
They're holding my husband downstairs.
I am not involved.  Keep clicking your little wires.  You'll get someone else.  Good luck.
Oh won't I?
Because you know you'll be killing us.
I have no idea.  They put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  The shutters up here are nailed shut.
Then they took the Mercedes away -- with his body in it.
26th off Wilshire.
What are you doing now?
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
And that was the end of it?
I'm sorry if I caused you to lose your business deal.
Pictures.
I didn't mean to insult you. You're an artist.
She's gone --
Jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
Don't talk.  Don't talk!
Theo, I want you to know, you're probably the most decent man I've ever met.
Because you're probably the last person I'll ever talk to.
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
No.
Did you hear that click?
They're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
I'm not leaving my daughter behind.  Not with them.
Yes.
Jack Oberfeld in person.  Did you kill him?
He seems to be headed for Topanga.
I think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  And when you thought I was being kicked around, I wish I could've seen your face.
You're enjoying this too much.
Did you hear that?
Think you could do a picture of me?
That's how it's going to be.
Exactly who was this Oberfeld?
Local lawyer for Dominican dealers.  Off to buy a half interest in a mall in Granada Hills on their behalf.
Who is this?
Granted.  But I don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
Thanks for the sound advice.  Now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  Alone.
I won't let 'em.
That bitch.  What's keeping you from taking off?
Not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  I may need to pry that information out of her.  What do you stand to gain?
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
If her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
He gave me a look.
Now, that was a look.
Don't want any of those looks, Col. They don't mean much.
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Not me.
How different?
Tell me about him.
Did you do that to him?
Can't think. He's dead. In Ireland. He was a soldier. Went there like a fool.
No, depends on nothing.
Must be.
Sure I do.
I said stop it.
Make it up to me, then.
Kind of wish I didn't.
You can always pretend.
Why, honey --
Prescription. For my condition.
Died...
It was you...
Okay.
You do?
Fergus.
You will, Dil
Thirty-five.
Need to lose myself awhile.
He's all right.
Someone's got to do it.
My pleasure.
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
You sure?
Peter.
Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
I understand.
Just a girl.
How is it a farce?
I can smell her perfume.
Five ten. Brown eyes. But you're no pinup.
No?
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Ah, c'mere. I want to show you something.
Why not?
What the fuck were you doing here?
And you play cricket?.
Ever see hurling?
Best game in the world.
You lack imagination, Fergus. Think of something more alluring.
I've often wondered how you do it.
Some kinds of women are...
You liked her?
I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
When I was a child...
Yeah?
You didn't?
And you know what?
That true, Fergus? You in love?
 I'll tell you what, fella -- you want t' find me, you jus' turn 'round -- from now on I'll be right behind you. 
What are you talking about?
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
It's lovely.
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
Adam --
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
No thanks.
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Thanks very much.
Were you followed?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you.  Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
Very good.
No, thank heaven.
Then how do I know this is your office?
Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
Oh.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
I met a man with sharp nails.
Scobie?
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
What -- like Scobie?
I don't think I know that one.
No -- not yet.
It's a start, anyway.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
I don't believe it.
Forty-five thousand.
Why bother him?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
Swiss.
I don't know. I suppose so.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
I know.  I'm sorry.
A letter? May I see it?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Yes. Your appointment has been changed.  One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen --  one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder  -- that is all.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded.  Sylvie!
I know. I would bury it in the garden.
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
I found it! I found it!
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
Mr. Joshua.  Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Shakespeare never said that.
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Are you in the book?
Charles is.
How did you find out?
We'll find you a hotel.
Who said?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
What was it?
Nothing. Good night.
What?
That's all.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Do you tell lies?
Good night.
But what?
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
Exactly. Then he must be a virgin.
Not my imports.
That's an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
Fine, just don't mention the carving This is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
Daddy you scared me!
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
How well did you know Stacy and Rod?
I will. Is that all?
No. She ate a pistol for lunch one day.

Who's?
Can you just follow me? The back is full?
Then you should go.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
No!
Hurricane Hormone. it's flattened the whole school. Guess what?
Especially not your dad.
Jody, you have to go to the party. For your own safety.
Follow me.
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
I did.
Everyone's grounded. There's a killer on the loose.
I have to go home after school. I have something really important I have to ask my mom.
I'm making you feel like meat?
Yeah.
This party is sick.
Yes?
No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
Not that I know of.
You didn't believe her?
Why not?
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
Not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. We both have...
Just thinking about something.
And she didn't?
Hi Sandy.
Now don't be nervous.
Hide your laptop here.
But you don't really mean it.
You're being unfair.
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY.
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - DAY.
...-ty.
Where's Sam?
No argument there.

No, no, no, no, no, no. Wait.
Hey, listen!  Do you know what I think?  I...
You are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
Then you drive me to McGrud-...
...-er.
Look...I got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  That shit will be worthless by noon.
And if that Elvis shit...
That dog was mean before I met him.
To get to McGruder, you have to go through Missoula, and I ain't goin' to Missoula.
You stole this truck.
God-...
Hey, take a look at your situation and...
...-er!
...let live.
 
Oh, shit.
Back up!  Back...
All right, you got it.
You think we can make what?!  You see that truck?!
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

Oh, shit.
Hey, hey!  Whoo!  Okay.
Come on, old Pete.
Get over!  Get over!
Come on, old Pete.  Oh.

...you crazy bastard.
Gee, you think so?
 ...shit!
Hang on!
 Shit. 
No.  Shit.
These'll keep it cold.
...yeah.
...you're dealin' with!


It won't even start half the time.
How wonderful for you.
...miles.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
You all right?


We're gonna die!
What?
Yeah.

  I've got the real thing!
...our ass!
...here comes the...
What the--?

 Vitelli! Vitelli!
Arlo, I'm gonna get Elvis.  You go.
...that Army nut job to save your narrow butt?
I was not in the man's face.  I was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
I was undercover as a tennis player.
That was quick.
So...where's my truck?
We do need your truck.
What the hell's a sage?
...owe you.

Looks like it.  Yes, sir.
This isn't some kind of pissing contest, Long.  You may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
It's too...
...about--
You look good, Richard.
...me?  Well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
Mm-hm.
"Went away."  I like that.
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
So far, ye-yes.
Why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
INT. BRYNNER'S VAN - NIGHT.
INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY.
This was supposed to be a...
...here!
What about these two?
Sir.
I'm Colonel Brynner, U.S. Special Operations Com-...
Yes, Captain Brynner, you did, but-but--
...what, Sam?  Can't I go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...scientists.
They'll get a break tomorrow.
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
...Long.
...your concern nor your fight.  Relinquish the package and you can go.
Your fellow hero, untouched...
...-spite the mouth.
Dead, last time I...
You'd never understand!
...-son.  Of all the days for you to show up late.  First, the idiot April calls in sick.  Then I got a bad tooth...
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
And don't give him any ice cream...
Story of my life.  Well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, I'll tell you that.
...he's smart enough to get you...
There's something else too.
Secrets.
Go.
...now!
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
All right, let's move...
And where are you going?
Uh-huh.
It could be a cover, I suppose.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?
Excellent.
...like a fish.
Some people might.
Well, your prediction was on the nose.
Yeah.
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
...-lem?
...selling this young man beer Wednesday night.
 Pappas!  Move the car!
...stole a truck under arrest.
...there's a colonel...
I'll lead 'em out.
 
INT. TUNNEL/AIR VENT - DAY.
INT. TUNNEL - DAY.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
What for?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Doesn't that strike you as odd?
You didn't see Mulwray much, did you?
When was the last time?
If you want to hire me, I still have to know what you and Mulwray were arguing about.
Well... she's an extremely jealous person. I didn't want her to find out about the girl.
What is it?
An obituary column... can you read in this light?
Ain't worth thinking about.
Just sitting down to supper, Jake. Care to join us?
I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
Why?
The apple core club.
No. The albacore. It's a fish. My grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
How'd you get past the guards?
I get by.
Yeah. Somebody wanted to shake down Mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know Mulwray was murdered.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
Certainly not!
Now wait a minute, Mrs. Mulwray...
Iced tea.
What?
Well, I've been accused of many things, Mrs. Mulwray, but never that.
I'll stop by.
My husband.
Did you have affairs?
That your maiden name?
I don't believe you.
What about you? Do you and your father get along?
No.
What? What is it?
I thought I was keeping someone from being hurt and actually I ended up making sure they were hurt.
He owns it. You know?
That's what your father said. You're telling me he's in back of this whole thing?
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
Then let's go talk to her.
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
You know any good criminal lawyers?
Yes positively. That's where he was drowned...
...no...
To Mexico...
Jesus, that's in Chinatown, ain't it?
The obituary column?
There's just one question.
Don't be sorry, neither does Dad. Wanted to make sure though, didn't we, honey?
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Oh yes. Hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. My goodness, what happened to your nose?
I cut myself shaving.
Mr. Gittes, my field men are out and I can't give you an exact location...
Yes...
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
So how are you, Morty?
Drowned, too.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Yeah.
I'm afraid so.
I'm sure he loves you, too. You know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? You're better off not knowing.
Money doesn't matter to me, Mr. Gittes.
They got into a terrific argument outside the Pig 'n Whistle.
When I find out who that phony bitch was.
Sue people like that they're liable to be having dinner with the Judge who's trying the suit.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
Oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. Julian Cross' daughter. God almighty. She was a wild little thing.
Why'd she run away?
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them! 
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Why? What do you mean?
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
No particular reason...  Nice day, huh? 
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Two cents.
Ready for dinner, Brad?
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
Two hundred and one thousand, six hundred and forty-seven.
That's right.  They called us the "Three Musketeers."
Thatcher!  That man was the biggest darn fool I ever met -
You don't say!  Why I had no idea -
Certainly not.
Probably.  There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Not to me.  But you will let that cop go home with Mr. Kane, won't you?
Yes, Mr. Bernstein.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
I don't my plans myself.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
There is no news big enough.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
Is it good?
We haven't heard from him.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles.  If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now.  I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
Too late for what?  Too late for you and this -  this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me?  Well, you won't do it, I tell you.  You won't do it!
Toothache.
You're no Venus de Milo.
Oh, me -
At night?
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything -  I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
You can't stop me.
Get out!  I've got nothing to talk to you about.  If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
I see! 
You've made your point perfectly clear, Mr. Kane.  Good day.
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein.  Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not.  Let me see -  Mike!
Yes, sir. 
Not my wife - not either of them.
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Good.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
Why not?  Well - nobody's a great man in your estimation until he's dead.
Charlie!  Now you're not making sense.
What's wrong, Brad?
I'll get you some coffee.
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
Hey, Brad!  I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state.  Well, Mr. Bernstein?
I can remember everything.  That's my curse, young man.  It's the greatest curse that's ever been inflicted on the human race.  Memory -  I was his oldest friend.  As far as I was concerned, he behaved like swine.  Maybe I wasnt' his friend.  If I wasn't, he never had one.  Maybe I was what nowadays you call a stooge -
He married for love -  That's why he did everything.  That's why he went into politics.  It seems we weren't enough.  He wanted all the voters to love him, too.  All he really wanted out of life was love. That's Charlie's story - it's the story of how he lost it.  You see, he just didn't have any to give.  He loved Charlie Kane, of course, very dearly - and his mother, I guess he always loved her.  As for Emily - well, all I can tell you is Emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair - there's supposed to be two sides to every story - and I guess there are.  I guess there's more than two sides -
That must have been love.
See what I mean?  He was a little gone in the head - the last couple of years, anyway - but I knew how to handle him.  That "Rosebud" - that don't mean anything.  I heard him say it. He just said "Rosebud" and then he dropped that glass ball and it broke on the floor.  He didn't say anything about that, so I knew he was dead - He said all kind of things I couldn't make out.  But I knew how to take care of him.
What the hell is that?
It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead.  Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this.
Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree!
Exactly.
You're very protective of him, Randal. You always have been.
Awww. That was so cute.
He was?
I feel nauseous.
Just now.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
So... what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?
I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens.
Was it you?
Call the police.
Just me.
No. I place the time of death at about three-twenty.
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
I can pass!
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.
Great story, isn't it?
They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.
I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.
Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?
Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.
Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
Perfect dozen.
I told him that and he yelled at me.
The milkmaids.
Why not?
Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right?
The best Burtless movie ever made.
I know.
I'm going to miss the game.
I can't believe I'm going to miss the game!
I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married.
Why not?
Wait, wait, wait. Has it occurred to you that I might bereaved as well?
You hardly knew her!
She meant nothing to you either until I told you she died.
That's nothing compared to how my cousin Walter died.
Fine. Just lend me your car.
I want to rent a movie.
I like to expand my horizons.
Five hundred dollars.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you?
Could be.
Shut the fuck up!
Why do I have this life?
I was born.
It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.
I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.
Leave her out of this.
How do you figure?
You were over half an hour late. Then all you do is come over here.
It's not like I'm miles away.
Hermaphrodites! I rented it so we could watch it together!
You need a ride?
I'm gone. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Yes.
And your name is Dante Hicks? You went to high school with her? You played hockey?
How do you know that?
To you?
Done poisoning the youth for the day?
Listen to you. Oh shit. "Oh, I don't hang out with drug dealers."
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
It's not my store.
We were going to start again, I think.
You calling me a liar?
Well, that depends. Do you have a bathroom?
Here. Now leave me alone.
Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!
Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...
She called you, didn't she?
Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
Why? You wanna have sex or something?
Typically male point of view.
I touched a nerve.
I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
You're a pig.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Unlike you, I have a class in forty- five minutes.
Oh my God-I feel so nauseous...
This is different. This is important. How many?!
Every time I kiss you now I'm going to taste thirty-six other guys.
What did he say?
And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen.
Thank you for being rational.
Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
I swear to God. Silent Bob, am I lying?
He is.
I do about three-fifty, four.
She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm.
I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs.
I beg your pardon!
Which one?
All right, asshole, you're on.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
What?
Who's shooting?
So...what are you, blind, son? This is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
I need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
Qualen, glad you stuck around. There should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
Wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
I'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
Look, I know--
Would you?
Is it really four thousand?
We spent a night there one night...
On my way.  Alright Sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
Had to leave?  Believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  We stayed.
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
You're saying, I don't understand?  I'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  I'm the one you lived with for two years, I'm the one you made promises to, I'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  Believe me, there's been times I didn't know what I wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  But the one thing in our relationship that I did know and still do know is that I <u>understand you</u>.
I'm not going to faint, but if I want to faint, I'll faint, okay?
Flare up of old emotions...
Where?
Jess--you look good.
What are you doing here!?
Remember the first time we came up here?
No, not really.  Throw down a rope.
For the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, I'm never alright.  When I secure the line, come on up.
Never, what?!
I've never weighed 135 lbs.!
Helluva time for vanity!
If we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
"Time is money" -- please.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
There's a lot more where that came from.  You're not leaving again?
What the hell's going on?
When he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
Copy.  Hal, tell Gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
Hold on, baby, he'll get you.
Where's the rest of the team?
What about it?
Primed to go off right over his head, officer.
Pardon me. Luce. He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk spurts into glass. Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou dost wish.
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir. His face contorted in rage.
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is going to happen to me. He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up with like gold and silver and like jewels.
The accidental killing of a person, sir.
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions? Priest rises and moves to Alex.
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally to see how you're getting along.
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.
Fine, fine.
Well - I'm back.
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away. Alex becomes a bit weepy.
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Alexander de Large, sir.
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
Do you mean Church of England?
Blue eyes?
No, sir.
Through there for a bath.
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
We're going to friends now, sir.
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.
How many did I get right?
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, have I?
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
Have you ever had any attacks of fainting or dizziness?
This is to make sure you stay cured. Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their blackjacks. After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,
Four in this block, sir.
Why'd you do that?  Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
It's no big deal.
Most of the time.
You need a vacation.
Yes, you could.  I think you need it more than I do.  It'll help.  I promise.
Max...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
Yes.
I was heading back to my garage.  It's on the way.
Unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  Unbelievable.
I think...
You tell me.  I had to toss the list in the river.  I was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  So why don't you show a little courtesy?
What homicide?  Phil.  Where's a body? Look.  All we got is glass...
Elvis?
...if they're wrong?!
What's your name?
Of course!
Jesus, what is with this guy?
I just got off the phone with the cops.  They called to check you brought the cab in...
<u>So?</u> Aside from I hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
Yeah.  Retirement?  Paid sick leave?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
I don't think I can do this.
How about the thingy next to it?
I'm making <u>you</u> nervous.  I'm the one with a schedule.
Adrenaline's wearing off.  You get shaky after.  It's not uncommon.  Deep breathing helps.
Who was he?
Because I have a gun and I say so.
Lenny, my dispatcher.
I'm collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
Teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can't stop.  I'm not playing.
It's not bullshit.
Yeah?  Like what?  Limos?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Doesn't cover everything.
You're gonna be me.  You're gonna go in, and you're gonna get the info on the remaining two hits.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
No, not just that.
What's at Union Station?
How are you at math?  I was hired for five hits.  I did four.
One more.
You're full of shit.
...all the cabbies in LA, I pull Max, the man with X-ray vision...
Who?
Geronimo.  When you're really in love, you'll jump.  Off the top of the Empire State.  Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
But you'll die.  You'll squash yourself.  What's the point?
I love her so bad.  She just... wrecks me.  I would die for her.
Shut the hell up.
Come on!  Six major earthquakes in the last three years?  The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Do you still ride?
You think I'm crazy.
I think you're different.
No.
Love.
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
I noticed.
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Never heard of him.
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
So what's the question?
You run with your back to the picture.  Like you were trying to get away.  Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
What van?
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Henry Finch.  That they monitor everything.  That it was only a matter of time.  And now four people are dead.
Right here in Manhattan.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Reagan didn't die.  If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Back where?
Why not?
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Now she tells me.
I like that.  A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay.  May have a headache for a few days.  Are you here with honorable intentions?
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions?  Are they honorable?
Here's a fresh one.  Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
The truth shall make you free.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Yes, that's right.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
What the hell does that mean?
Wasn't my idea.
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
No idea.  Honest.  What are you going to do?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
There's no plug to pull.
What?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
Glad to have you, David.  How's the new office?
Still settling in, really.  Where's Dr. Arroway?
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
I disagree.
Now exactly.  It's... complicated.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Are you threatening me?
Ellie.
Excuse me, I'm late for a meeting.
A third layer.
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz.  I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
On that old shortwave?  Maybe on a clear night.  Come on now, under the covers.
So who...?
Not all.  Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.  Some never make it this far.
So we passed some kind of test?
That isn't the way it works.
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Ellie... this is the way it's been done for billions of years...
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
A page-break signal.  A period.
Not if you think like a Vegan.
That's my girl.  Done.
The systems integration site.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction.  Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
The V.L.A.?
But the work --
Maybe that's the problem.  I want... a family, Ellie.  I want kids.  A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid.  A real life.  Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
In other words, God is one hell of an engineer.
I don't follow.
It's late.  We should go back.
The final countdown.
I can't do this --
Please --
It was quite a page turner.
Ellie, you're the proof.  You tell them your story.  Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you!  The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!
Recommendations?
Smokin' it up here, Boss.
No.
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
She took off with that convertible feller...
I'm leavin' the place to John.
I... I... I...
How my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
Cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, Captain.
Mister Cool Hand here is the soft heart in our Loan Department. Next!
Tramp! Beautiful!
I kin see that, brick head. I mean your hole card.
He's been betting his head from the gun. Gotta have kings.
'Bout two hours left.
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
What for?
I thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
The man wants speed, let's give it to him. Ram it in and break it off. Go hard. Shag it.
Knock it off, Luke! You cain't talk about Him that way.
Thass right. Just play it...
Come on, boy, come on, darlin'. You kin do her. Just let that ol' belly sag and enjoy itself. Stay loose, buddy. Eight more, between you and everlasting glory. Little ol' eggs, pigeon eggs, that's all, fish eggs practically.
No more than five. For a cold drink.
Bet! Babalugats, bet here!
Cuter again.
All the bears gonna be walking today.
Would you please get your hands off my face, Tallulah?  What happened to the newspaper?
Are you kidding?  You buy enough gourmet junk every week... most of which <u>rots</u>... to garage a fleet of stretch limos.
He whispered, but it was <u>him</u>!  I know it was him!
Then, why don't you just die.  I'm going.  They'll find your body years later, the old recluse lady, she ate cat food, ten years of the New York Times, unread, piled on top of the unread mail, the TV still on.  Make up your mind.  Live or die.  I'll get coffee.
I'm the only friend you've got, darling, and I don't intend to stop doing what I think is good for us.
Look out for her.  She's tougher than you think.
You've got a date right <u>here</u>, Andy. This has got to...
Tell her about <u>what</u>?
Doesn't work that way.  You had your chance, now fuck yourself...
What day is this?  In jail you lose track.  This week.  Friday.
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She's supposed to have it.
You read my book which as you know, hit the stands a couple of weeks ago.  You read it yet.
In jail.
Who was the man in the basement?
Where are you, Peter?
You know I can't do that.
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
I think this is number three...
That's an opinion, not evidence...
<u>You</u> called <u>us</u>, Doctor Hudson.
I think you are.  I really admire everything you've done; it would be an honor to work with you, and we need all the help we can get, especially yours.
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
I want a guard on you.  I'm worried about leaving you alone.
But it's a different m.o.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
I'm giving you Clint outside.
Because I'm all you've got.
What's that music.  It's Abba.  I can hear it.  It's Abba.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
Let me get a little action started here.
Not yet.
Who prescribes the brandy?
You're shitting ion your career.  You outrank hi...
Doped up kids all over town.  Park was full of them last night.  Very easy pickin'.  Goetz's type.
You came in there with this attitude...
Quinn decided we should form a task force -- they're all one case, now. He wants all the senior detectives on it...  She wasn't killed here.
You're right.  I can't stand that bastard.  Sorry.  This is something new.  Not the same guy, that's for sure.
Helen... excuse me, we...
Shut up.
Yessir.
It's not the same guy.  It should be a self-solver.  No bow around the neck, left and body outdoors, completely different.  The others were housewives, secretaries, he talked his way inside, killed them in their own living room or bed- or bathroom.  This one didn't have a husband or a boyfriend, no family, temp waitress, 3 arrests for misdemeanor dope offenses, DUI, asphyxiation probably from a plastic bag over her head.  Sexually assaulted.  The others weren't molested that way.  We're waiting for the sperm tests...
Nikko?
I just got here.  Talk to you later...
Then you shoulda known she wasn't buying.  She was just long-term leasing' you.  Ah, Nickie.  Except for that rare twenty-second twitch, there ain't nothin' about sex I don't hate. But of course, I'm Irish.  Plus I got <u>real</u> problems.  I'm worried I might have to put you in over M.J.  There's something going on here, the Commissioner is targeting her now, I can't leave a woman in that position.  But the thing is, how can I move <u>you</u> in, if you go on acting like a teenage asshole?
They consider this to be the airport hospital. This ward is reserved for air- crash victims. The beds are kept waiting.
You should have gone to the funeral.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Is the traffic heavier now? There seem to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident.
You're not envious?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
At home. I couldn't face all this traffic.
I'd like to go back. James...
Can I give you a lift?  I somehow find myself driving again.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
I'm sure the police would make an exception in your case.
Really? What kind of exhibition is it?
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
It's something we're all intimately involved in: The reshaping of the human body by modern technology.
What about the reshaping of the human body by modern technology? I thought that was your project.
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
I know Michael's a schizophrenic, and Mrs. Hallstrom's manic- depressive, and John Lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and I heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
It was just a little going-away gesture.
Mom and Dad? At dinner together? Are you crazy?
Thanks so much for planning it, Letty. Jake's really looking forward to it.
I'll be back before you can say souffle.
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
Oh, no, of course not.
Paul said he'd call the school.  And your father thinks he's convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
You're looking good.    A little thin, but good.
I've already made arrangements.
Lie?
It's OK.   It's good to let it out.
Who do you think you are?
Anything interesting.
A rose is a rose.
Wow.    I'm bad news.
The mission up in Santa Barbara.
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Michael, I...
It's OK. You don't have to say anything.
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
Throw pillows, Letty. The sales lady said they're the latest thing.
I was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. Now we can watch two shows at once.
Let's try out the bed.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
It's sex time.
I'll see you tonight.
Yeah.    How was the job search?
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
It's hard to know where to start.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
Well then why'd it happen?
She's only known the guy a few months.
In there's better.  It's kind of romantic, don't you think?
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
I'm calling in sick.
Have you been seeing another teacher?
I love him.
I like those sapphire earrings myself.
You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
They don't have a murder weapon?
Marcel?
Oui.
No.
Oui.
What?
Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties?
-- Super what?
And the other half?
You have something for me?
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
We are tired and bored with your bullshit. So, put that stupid little knife away before Zero shoves it up your ass.
And the Vodka.
I'm trying.    It doesn't work.
You know, if you could get your nose out of Bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what's going on around you.
This ain't about that and you know it. This is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good. Zero and Julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. The rest of us will come in through the front door.
You steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. But these tapes. He's never going to stop looking for us.
No?
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
Can I trust you, Sami?
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
You better.
Don't bullshit me.
-- Don't think. Okay?        You're not good at it.
I'm telling you I've pulled out everything in the safe. There aren't any jewels.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Yes.
Hey, it's not your picture on the TV, it's mine. So, try to be cool.
It doesn't matter where we go. Between Zammito and the FBI they'll find us. We have to end this here.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
I don't know.     It's gotta be millions.
The hell it is.
I'm telling you that's my car!   And someone's gonna pay for it!
How?
That's how you get to know someone.       Did it hurt when you got it?
You got it in a bar?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
A car.
It's for you.
Why were you spying on the Yus?
Then tell me where Jade Fox is.
Real sharpness comes without effort.
Tell me, who is your master?
Don't bother.
I have a guest.
Really?
What do you think?
You're probably right.
I'll write your name.  Just for fun.
About you and Li Mu Bai?
His name was Meng Si Zhao.  He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy.  After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together.  Our feelings for each other grew stronger.  But how could we dishonor Meng's memory?  So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it.  But I have never tasted it.
Then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
He really loves you.  Come back to Peking with me.  We'll find a solution.
Come and get it if you can.
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
You coward!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Let them look.
I will.
Good.  And how are you?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
You use it justly, you're worthy of it.
First I must visit my master's grave.  It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him.  I have yet to avenge his death.  And yet I'm thinking of quitting.  I must pray for his forgiveness.
I didn't think she'd dare come back to Peking!
Have you questioned him yet?
You did your job well.  But, this girl... I saw her last night.
What about you?
We followed Jade Fox.
Shu Lien...
I heard Sir Te lost something.  And now Madame Te's not feeling well...
Sir Te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
I doubt it.  This thief... it very unusual...
Father!
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Please, Sir Te, what is it?
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
No onions?
Don't thank me.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital.
The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her.
It's only a flesh wound.
Fun, he's not going away; he's scaring the piss outta me!
Who?
No name.  You sure ask a lot of questions.
I think he's yours, now.
You mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave?  Euww.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
You don't even remember...
I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief.
Mmm.  But tonight I can take what is his.
Move in, guys.
Did you know Sebastian well?
That's right.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
You didn't show it to anybody?
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
Why not?
You a lesbo?
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Give me the fucking letter.
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you.  You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
I said I was sorry.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
That's none of your business.
That's also none of your business.
What are you doing?
Somerset Maugham.
You must take me for a real idiot.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
I do not.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
What are you saying?
I love you.
Doesn't ring a bell.
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
Outstanding.
Relax. It's okay. Take a deep breath.
Absolutely.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
That's great.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Is it that obvious?
Well do you like him?
Did you hide the letters?
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
He'll love it.
Need any company?
No. This is going to be our last session.
It works a little.
Jesus!
And you think she bought it?
I'm pretty sure she did.
Pretty sure or sure sure?
Yeah?
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
I'll be right there.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
What?
You don't mean?
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Yippy.
Who are you spying on?
Take a look for yourself.
What's your problem?
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her.  She made me laugh.
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Mock, mock, mock.
I'm not in the mood.
Well done.
Come again?
Will you calm down?
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Annette! Annette!
Young man, I already told you she's not here.
We played backgammon?
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
She really loves me.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday — about Oliver's first marriage — and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy — although he'll never realize it.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
On the back street — a green house
Are they nice?
Irena.
All right, mommy.
All right, Amy.  Go tell Edward to take you.
You're shouting at me.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
I'm sorry. I was somewhere else. He returns to the card game.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
In the garden? Would she be there now?
I have eyes too, and I tell you no one's there. If you deny that, if you insist that this woman you call your friend is in the garden, then I'm afraid I shall have to punish you. Do you understand?
But there's no one here, darling.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
Yes, darling.
I don't know yet.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
I shall wear it in my hair!
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? </PRE><PRE>                                AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
No, thank you.
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed.  I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
No.
I've been working out.
At Victoria's Secret.
Oh, on my wrist.
Good. Except for PMS.
That's just part of being a woman. Diet and exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
Okay, but I'm worried about the next PMS bout. It's gotten worse. I'm not myself during it. I get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and I have more facial and body hair.
Diet and exercise, that's all there is. I'm not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "The PMS Diet," which may be helpful.
I'd kill for just a little bloated.
Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
You're just saying that.
I think he called you beautiful.
I still thought it was a purse.
Geez, I wish I'd get it like that.
It's just cause mine is finer. A little bleach'll fix that.
I haven't gotten it yet.
Oh no.
Why not? There's been a murder.
You're such a good friend.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
She died at age 34 in the 1800's. They thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband shot her.
So... she was a werewolf. Do you think we can believe all this?
No, he's the guy I'm having an affair with.
I wish I only had your problems.
You said you're starving. Come on, I can't stand a woman who won't eat.
I wouldn't mind doin' something else, but I do really have to pee.
Since when do you care?
No.
Worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
It's Mark.
I just need a place to lay low for a few days. Come on, I know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the East River?
Uh... yes. Not for us. No woman in jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
At least let me give you this back. I washed it.
Used to? Did it stop finally?
A lot of people don't wear underwear.
He was ripped to shreds also. In his apartment.
They're for my cat. I use them to train him not to rip up paper.
No, it's a good thing. I like it. Everything about you is great. I like how you don't shave your legs. Women are so much sexier when they're natural.
Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with that.
I can't take that chance... I couldn't live with myself if I did anything to you.
No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
You use the word "fucking." You're sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It's okay to have sex.
No, take it.
Packages of money.
Two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
She's just so... pathetic.
We can just take this pillowcase.
That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
One of our only leads... You had dates with both men right before they were killed.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
And fifth, you're dating her.
What the fuck are you following me for? I'm not a suspect here.
What makes her think that?
Just this morning. Animal hairs were found all over the victims.
Only two bucks.  Shave as well...
Yeah, Iím like that.  Senility says the wife.  But she sure canít complain.  Heh.  The erector set still works good.  And this ainít no fucking rug! Gíhead.  Feel it!  All mine!
No one available.
Iíll be the judge of that.  Anything else?
I didnít requisition a secretary.
Iím sorry...
Put it through...
Well.  The only thing I've been certain of, all this time, is that I need to get to the ocean.  The point is no one seems to know how to get there.
Is that your idea of a joke?  I don't remember...  Take my advice, Bumstead.  Get off this case.  Now.
What is going on?
Where does it lead?
But I...
You know something about me?
Maybe.
I have to go...
So you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  Is that it!
Everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  But this one's special.  It will help you understand, everything...
Why?
How do you know I'm innocent?
Oh... Okay.
I promise.  I won't.
Great.
No...
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
) Listen, you little...
You're lint!  You're a flea!  You're a blip!
Up and around?  Soon?
I was a senator, you know.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I don't think so.
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Sort of... Yeah.
Oh yeah... Me, too.  You want to get dinner later?
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
So what do we do?
Now,  let's say the whole country. Was in that car.   The entire United States of America.
Wrong...
Alan...
Really?
`Bleed for your king.'
No... They don't kid.
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
Anybody would have done it.
You1re leaving, too?
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
I know.
I sure fall for some weird guys.
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
All set.
And if I don't? If I don't you'll come back after your death. You'll come back and find yourself hanging there...wanting to eat...needing to eat human flesh. You hate that thought, don't you? That's the ultimate sin for most of you fools, isn't it?
Where are your headquarters, rebel? Tell me or I'll let you hang there forever...FOREVER!
Leave him.
Gasparilla?
Governor Dickerson? Of Florida?
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
What?
We're hopin' you can show us where ta go, Toby.
Come on. Let's go.
You can believe this, Miguel. I'll kill you if you shoot. We must wait. I'll....I'll do it....I'll do it myself....when it needs to be done.
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
MARY!
Actually I don't
To fucking Mutt.
It will?  How do you figure?
At Chet Danburry's house.
Yeah.
Yep.
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.
I couldn't stop myself.
I'm sorry.  I, we
Isn't he precious?
And are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  If all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
What?
I'm not?
Please!    It's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
Doing fine, sir.
Sure, but Cameron asked me too.  Anybody mind including him?
To put the rout all that was not life.  And not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.  Pledge Overstreet.
Maybe he'll have some advice.  Maybe he'll even talk to your father.
Chet...
I don't care.  I love you, Chris.  You deserve better than Chet and I'm it. Please accept these.
Well, you did!  Chet found out and he's nuts.  It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Then you wouldn't be here warning me about Chet.
What is that?
Mr. Overstreet, I suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  Do you understand?
Seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  Why does the poet write these lines?
What was going on in the courtyard the other day?
At these boys' age? Not on your life! Tradition, John.  Discipline.  Prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
Excellent!  Have him act.  Give it rhythm!
Ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
Good luck.
But different.
Well, you've won the booby prize.  Don't expect to like it here.
Put what?  Goddamn it, tell me.
What I want to do!  Right now. What is really inside of me.
So I'm gonna act!  Ever since I can remember I've wanted to try it.  Last summer I even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
Why don't you ask him first?  Maybe he'll say yes.
Why not?  Don't you think you could be?
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
I mean, this is one special gift!  Who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
Yeah!  And just look at this ruler!
We have to make it to the third deck...
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
With who?
That's where my boat's moored.
Just trying to get to my boat...
You people...rich people...
Thank you, I work at it...
Takes one to know one.
No...
Forget them...
What? You don't think I can have a normal life?
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
Plans don't change...
What?
I'm telling you, they changed it!
Who? Who is?
She does, Vince! That's what I'm telling you! She does!!!
Nick, he's fine. He's in a hospital and they're fixing him up.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But I insist.
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
Merle is under his tree... Beside the terrace. You can't miss him.
That's right. That's exactly what I mean!
Only,good people love Linda, see. What Linda has, Linda --
Sure! I got eight hundred potatoes says he goes one more... He retired, you know.
Shhh! Albert's gonna hump the Coup de Ville.
Oh well! What do you mean Oh well?! The guy is actually... He did it again! That's what he's doing... He... He's reaching in, John, to her --! I'll kill him! I'm gonna kill him right now.
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
Would you?
I don't know.
I made you a sweater.  Here... You have to take that off.
What?
I... No. You do this for money?
Listen to me, Sal. If you don't do it they'll put you in the pit. If they put you in the pit, Sal, you're gonna die... Sal, do you understand?
Right.
That way it sets.
Huh?
The shot?
I don't know... I guess I think about the deer... Being out, maybe. I don't know. I think about it all. Hell, I like the trees, you know? I like the ways the trees are, all the different ways the trees are too.
Yeah.
Yeah... I mean so he knows... He doesn't even know.
I thought you might be praying.
LISTEN, NICK! GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD OR YOU AND ME ARE BOTH DEAD TOO!
Nick... NICK!!! It's the only chance we've got!
No way. No fucking way!
I like it, Nick.
How much? How much do you wanna bet?
Then lemme have 'em.
I'm gonna start slow... At the top. Then I'm gonna work down.
Great. That's great.
That's my plan.
Place is great. Really. One great place... Basketball, bowling. You name it. Canasta. Hearts. Lots of guys are making salad bowls. What I'll do is make a salad bowl for you, unless you'd rather have a pencil holder. The pencil holder's neat, I mean --
Here. Behind you.
Naw.  Uh-huh.
Down.
Technothugs?
Wade did a little reminiscing.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
Fuck you - fuck you.
Maybe re-animating you wasn't such a bright idea.  You look like shit.
I'm going to bring this down hard. I've got an A-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I'm risking everything on you. You're going to bring him in.  I don't care how.  If you do, you'll get your freedom.  An official pardon from me.  A clean slate.  A good job.  A chance to get back with your family.  If you don't want to, I'll put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you'll forget you were ever defrosted.
Fill it out.  Standard issue mal- practice insurance.  All Cops carry it.
I've been alone for twenty years. I don't feel very sociable.
Got compliments coming outta your ass, don't ya?
I heard about today.  Good job.  I'm all for capital punishment.  Why don't you go home and see your family?
I'm thrilled beyond belief.
You sure?  I can help you.
Are you a cop?
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
How then?
You don't follow the bodies, and you don't follow procedure.  You do it by instinct.  Think like him.  Do what has to be dane.
Engaged.  Plan on doing it this summer.  You still married?
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
We're partners, aren't we?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
What's your name?
Oh --  Didn't mean to talk like that in front of a lady.  Get some wine for the Squire, Belle.
Belle --
Maybe you can, sometime, Daniel. I'm a farmer, you know, and like to show my farm -- but the thing I'd like to show you most, you'll have to see for yourself.
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
That's fair enough, Jabez. Man's got a right to mull things over. We'll drive round again, week or so.
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
-- in gold.
You know -- some folks are just lucky. Others pick gold right out of the air.  Like that!
I dunno -- I can't figure it out. I've invited them all. Why don't they come?
Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
Oh come, Neighbor Stone. I wouldn't cut that tree if I were you. It means a breach of contract.
Leave your tongue off of that!
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
Just a minute, neighbor Stone. I promised you money and all that money can buy. I don't recall any other obligations. But let's look at the contract.
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
He was --
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Gentlemen, the prosecution rests.
Mr. Webster -- I'd like you to meet my wife, Mary.
Well? Don't a politician have to be?
Well -- yes --
Oh yes -- I am -- want to bet?
All right -- only he needn't dirty my pants!
That's what we said.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
If the pig hadn't broke his leg, we could have taken him.
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
He's my son and I like him the way he is. Why do you always have to pick on him? If it's not the boy it's me. You don't like the way I live -- you don't like my friends, or my new house -- or anything.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
All right, Jabez ...
And why should I? Let him howl if it makes him feel good.  Consarn it. He's better off than I am! I wish I could tell Him...  ... up there, just what I think.
Gone with Daniel Webster -- to Marshfield, son.... You told Mary to go--
And you didn't get it, hey? Come on, we'll have another talk with him.
Very well, folks. I accept.
H'm. Hessian gold. Well -- hope it'll do us more good than it did the Hessians.
Yes, sir -- I guess I do -- Gee --
Of course not --
Someone to see you, Dan'l!
Just someone from New Hampshire!
Well, I never heard the dev-- of your claiming American citizenship.
No, no ...  I want to talk to men ... to people in Cross Corners ...to my neighbors ...
That's okay.  This is my first time riding in one.
They don't look happy...something's gone wrong.
And if he alters it...?						*
If you'd listened to me he would be neutralized already!
You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you?
Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass -
Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts.
No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes!
* Well have a look at what our friends outside are doing and I'll be right up.
Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom.
Sure.  Follow me.
That's okay...  ... I have an eye on his private bathroom.
Don't I always?
So I've heard.
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Got it...'Roy'.  Now listen.  If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job.  Understand?
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
Two?  Are you sure?
You sound like a man with a couple of kids.
I'm here, cowboy.
Yeah.  But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.  By the way, chalk up two more terrorists.
They boys'll be glad.  We got a pool going on you.
Dwayne Robinson.  Well, what have you learned?  What do they want?
What's it look like?  We're going in.
Okay.
Come on, nobody's gonna get hurt. If they were gonna shoot, they'd shoot now.
Well, how'll I get home?
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ...
What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
I'm sorry...
I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maye this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out. And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want.
I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going?
Sal?  Yeah... Sal is with me.
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
It's my only chance!
Right.  See you sometime.
Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh?
How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
How many you got in there?
Sure ... like ... I'm not gonna shoot you.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. 
Eugene, at 3:07, this became Federal.  Why don't I take it over now?
I can take care of that.
My side, shit!
Gimme the traveler's checks and the register.
I took too long.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
Well, they go to guard school.
I don't care who you are ...  I just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they don't give a damn.  In spite of that bank insurance.  You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
Special to me, too.
Are you a lawyer?
Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf...
Howard!
You were terrific, too!
Oh, a long time.  Because I kept asking my husband where the heck could Junior be?  He wasn't around here.  I thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
My body?  What for?
Well, I stalled him for a while. When it comes the time, then we'll work it out.  Okay?
It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right ... they're great ...
Get over there!
Okay, Sonny.
Let's move it, goddamn it.
You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out?
Mom - I got it all worked out; it's over.  The best thing is you go home.  Watch it on TV.
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
Not now, Mom, please.
<i>The Bounty Hunters have arrived. They will drop off the money in exactly one hour.</i>  <i>Where do you want to meet?</i>

Crypto-fascist? Who talks like this?!
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?

And I--we--want some Black people up.
What did I tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I've been here a long time.
I'm not stopping.  I'm on my way.
I hope the block is still standing.
I said my name is Eddie Lovell.
How would I know how much it's gonna cost if I don't know what I'm buying?
Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
Oh, it doesn't, huh!  You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
Don't like 'em.  A fan will do.
Look at that.
Nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
Who doesn't work?  Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.
Be off in a second.  Tina, I dedicated a record on Mister Señor Love Daddy's show to you.
Sal, just this once, do me that solid.
You must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
OK.  OK.
Alright.  Alright.  I'll be over there sometime today.
I just forgot.
Long enough for us to do the nasty.
Trust me.
Why you gotta curse?
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
No rawness.
You're to the curb.  You better step off.  Get a life.
It's e-vit-able.
Keep dreaming.
It's Prince.  He's a Prince freak.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
He's nuts.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
And that's exactly what I'm talkin' 'bout.
I'm sick of niggers, it's a bad neighborhood.  I don't like being around them, they're animals.
I'm gonna kill somebody today.
Don't start on me today.
She's saying... a beautiful swan...
Actually, my name is Cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
You're the kid who was home schooled.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
LLOYD? What about Ms. Heller?
Po, po, position...? Hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
Just down the hall.
Famous? I've never heard of it.
I don't follow.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
What?
Why not?
Peg leg?
Where did you learn that word?
I learned it from listening to you! I hate you!
Shut up Lloyd. You're not married yet.
A. Slushee. Don't tell me.  Abraham Slushee. Third president of the United States.
They can't be real.
Sorry. Why are you dressed like a Queen!?
HARRY, I said don't 'dress like a Queen'!
Oh... that makes much more sense. I had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. You don't want to know where I put the cord.
Me, me, me!
Me, too. This is my favorite part of the tape.
We never thanked him for giving us our Special Needs class.
Yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
So can I come along?
You mean the lunch room?
Look Ms. Heller, there's something fishy here, and I don't think it's Friday's special.
Oh I think you do.
You're just jealous.
Don't answer me. Say what I say.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Maybe it's this mix tape I made you. Or maybe these flowers. He gives Jessica the flowers and tape.
That's it. I'm done.
That was fast. Well, did you at least enjoy it?
LLOYD, when we were in Principal Collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
HARRY's treasure chest? Sure. I know where that is.
Can you believe it?
Okay.
I liked it a lot.
Oh yeah, give it to me.
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
My boy's special, well how about that. I knew you were different.
So I guess you'll need a new spot for your moonshine.
Or maybe crossing a river!
Museum huh, haven't been there since my husband left me. I love art.
Loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. A big loser.
He was a big loser! What are you deaf!?
And, take some more pictures.
Piter.
I prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... Noble Born.
Yes?
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
Yes.
Yes.
I hope I made myself clear. You may call him "The Duke," "My lord," or "Sire." And there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "Noble Born."
Good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
Yes...
I am a servant of the His Majesty the Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
Too bad... thought they were Harkonnen.
Long live the fighters!
Let us say I suggest you may be human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so you will die. You will feel an itching -- there... see? Now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
Stop him, Jessica!
"Beg to differ?!"  Hey, I'm talkin' about my duplex in Burbank!
No.
I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
I apologize.  When I play Dracula, I put myself into a trance.  It takes me much time to re-emerge.
Don't you bave a car?
Back in the old days, yes.  But now -- no one give two fucks for Bela.
I never thought of that.
Well, It's about how people have two personalities.  The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
I don't understand.
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!  Well, we got a big day planned for you... First, we're gonna start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  Then, once you're up to speed and cooking, we'll reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
I wrote something special for you. I got to thinking about all the sacrifices you've made... and so I wrote you a new final speech.
Why aren't you on your honeymoon? Where's Myrna?
Eddie, I received a letter from the government.  They're cutting off my unemployment.  That's all I've got. Without it, I can't pay the rent...
Has anyone ever been to Downey?
I know none of <u>my</u> wives would've.
Rolling.
You <u>can't sit</u>!  You gotta walk around, with good posture.  You want these people to think we have class. Otherwise they'll <u>never</u> invest in our movie.
I guessed.
What?
Ed, it was only one review.
Tell him "Bride" is in pre- production.
But what's our relationship?  Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
Dolores, I got five days to shoot this movie.  Quit kidding around.
Ed, it's over.  I need a normal life.
But you used to say --
For this one, we need $60,000.
Hmm.  Those sound kind of small.  Oh, here's one that looks good: Janet Lawton.  I'd sure like to play her.
Screen Classics?  Hmm, don't know them.
Hruphh...?
Would that work?
From outer space!  It's science- fiction.  <u>Very</u> big with the kids! If you make this picture, you'll have enough money to finance a HUNDRED religious films!  <u>And</u> pay my back rent from the profits.
Oh, of course!
But what bout accent?  Some people tink I haf too much accent.
Nah, that doesn't matter!  It's a visual medium.
But I thought me and Dolores had something.
Yes?
Oh.  Um, I'm Ed Wood!  So, what are you working on now?
Ugh, I hate when that happens.
And they always want to cast their buddies -- it doesn't even <u>matter</u> if they're right for the part!
Tell me about it.  I'm supposed to do a thriller at Universal, and they want Charlton Heston to play a <u>Mexican</u>!
So you're not a fruit?
Fine, maybe you're right.  But it doesn't friggin' matter.  I can't afford a star, so I don't even know what we're talking about.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Ed, what was the one thing I asked you to do?  Make it <u>seven reels long</u>. I've got contracts with my exhibitors.  If it ain't over an hour, they won't play it.
Screw you, Wood!  I even sunk more money into different titles: "Transvestite" "He Or She?" "I Led Two Lives"... It DOESN'T MATTER! Nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
The marriage already ended.
Oh, hi.
No! I love sex with girls.
STOP!
The poor girl's out of a job.
Yes?
You want me to show it on my TV program?  Well I got nothing to do with that.  You should call up the station manager at Channel Seven --
You don't wanna be noticed?
Well it looks good.  Let's use it!
Uh, I couldn't reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  But this'll be great, I promise!
Don't worry, I'll teach you.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Look at your face. I had a car that color.
This is real, Bananahead!
She doesn't give a shit about him.
No, uh...
I do.
I feel like when I was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
Yeah, that's why I called. I mean, maybe Fed-Ex would tell me where she moved --
Ed --
Ed --
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Oh -- so I'm just, what -- a poor substitute?
Oh right, right! She fell down, like a...
And then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
Send him? Ma, I can't. it's -- just come out here. Please, I --
No. It's a mess.
Look, Ma, come on out. Really. I need to talk to you.
He made a mistake.
I don't care what he says. Look, I don't need to relive this. On television!
St. Joseph's.
Why shouldn't I be in a place like this? I'm a whore!
Ma...
No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right?
Look, if you don't let me out of this... I'11 just... I'11 just sit in my apartment all day. I won't go anywhere, I won't do anything. What kind of show will that be?
Our foibles, our foibles!
I can't do that to him. He's pushing a little too hard - but... I just can't do that to him.
I batted!
Who's in it?
Oh, the whole family loved him. Of course, they loved the last guy I went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
Why do it?
Go!
You should see the one we wear when it rains.
Sunday night at the Devils game, I'm driving the Zamboni.
So...?
No. If I quit I don't get the balloon payment.
So act now. Here's Ed's home phone number.
Hey. You know-- we're not the same. I got a good life, this job suits me. I come and go when I please --
See, they should've picked him. Look how comfortable he is out there.
Yeah. You know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. That's how they met.
What's the dif --
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
You brought the cameras here!
I love you! 1 want to marry you!
Hi.
It's Ed.
What...
No. Ray sat on it. I'11 see you.
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
What is? Oh, dinner!
By the X. That's were two lines cross -- forming an X.
pierdo.
Look, Jim...  Okay.  I know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  But now it's different.  Jim, what I'm trying to tell you is that Tracy and I are totally, totally in love.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
I'm not talking about ethics.  I'm talking about morals.
And I know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
Come on, doit. Doit. Fill me up. Come on, fill me up
Dick... Dick,..
So nice
Not wasting any time, are you, Tracy?
Right
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
That sounds good.
I've got an idea.
I hope so
Walt, we can't throw her out of the election just because we don't like her speech.  That's not what student government's about.
I don't believe you.
Take me to that motel.  Like you wanted.
Don't say that.  You know it's not true.
I know.  I understand disappointment. I really do.
Let me give you a clue.  You're a born leader.  You're one of the most popular students at Millard.  You're honest and straightforward.  You don't choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against Westside.  The other kids look up to you.  What does that spell?
Paul... Paul.... We'll have plenty of time to get into all this later.  A whole year, in fact. Right now I just need to finish my pie and get home.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
If you say so.
Larry, you just take it easy
These are private -- these are for us.
It's a conflict of interest.  And Paul was first.
Oh, no, hey.  Like I said. Tammy wouldn't... she...
Yeah.
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
Yeah.  Oh, one more thing. Tammy. You know, all this election stuff. 'Cause, you know, everyone is saying it's so weird that you're running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you haven't really told me why you're doing it and didn't tell me in advance or anything.  But that's okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  I just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it's you or me, there's no hard feelings. We're still brother and sister.  Okay? Cause... and I hope you feel the same.
Okay.  Great.  I feel good.
I saw you fight Kid Gavilan.  I like your style.
Till 19-fucking-70.
How'd she meet Patchett?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
When they deserve it.
Did they deserve it today?
No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print.
It's Bud.
He's the opposite of you.  He's more like me.  Cold, calculating.
Yeah, I hate them.
Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing.
Of course... But how?
You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you?
What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing?
What are you talking about?
No!  Please leave!
Yeah.  A great big one.
Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people.
Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot.
Patchett uses a lot of ex-cop muscle.
If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all.
Do you care about criminal matters peripheral to Susan's murder?
You wanna go downtown and discuss this officially?
More's gonna cost you.
I got a few Nite Owl questions.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately.
I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective.
Until he gunned down six people.
Nothing, Ray.  That Larry, he's a pisser.  You did the Casitas Youth Camp with him, didn't you?
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray?
Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one.
At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them.
White's a mindless thug.
Yes, I do, sir.
We got a call earlier on three Negro youths.  Firing shotguns in Griffith Park from a late-model purple Mercury Coupe.
You're Narco, lad, not Homicide. And since when do you work with Edmund?
No.
What?
Yesterday yes, today no.  What happened last night?
What's Fleur-de-Lis?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I'll take your word for it.
Why not?
You, me and White, huh?
The proof had his throat slit.  So far you're not denying it.
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
Sid, how are they hanging?
He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks.  That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career.
Sid, cut the crap.  I --
Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like?
Something like that.
Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right?
Oh?  Anyplace else?
So...how much money do you want in exchange for not ruining my life?
I don't want any money. And believe me, I have no interest in ruining your life. I'm not interested in this tape.
You're not.
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
Okay.
Exposure. They can't have it. They wanna learn what you know and then deal with it.
What am I gonna do?! I mean, like, for the rest of my <u>life</u>?!
Look, you gave me some work over the last year. We'll call it even.
I'll pay you.
If you find something, chalk the Baltimore Sheraton mailbox and go to Temperanceville. It's South of Salisbury.  And take this.
And you were worried about me. That's nice, I appreciate--
What'd I tell you?
Welcome to Santa's Workshop.
What's going on?
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
What if <u>what</u>?
Same way they did with you and me. We take their biggest guy and turn him into one of us.
We'll have to re-stock some basics.
I know my phone number and I know the number for SportsPhone. Beyond that--
Is Jerry Delsano in?
The thing is, Senator, and I don't want to get in the middle of nothing, but--
With what?
Oh, God, I <u>knew</u> it was stupid, I <u>knew</u> we'd get caught. But the Gameboy was just <u>sitting</u> there. Right on top of the bag. Yes. Yes. We took the GameBoy out of the bag, but with every intention of putting it back.
You're a tough nut to crack, Dylan.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
Is that good?
I'll say.
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
What kind of trouble.
I'm not his attorney.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No.
<u>Yes</u>, for my wife, what the hell kinds of questions are these.
A toaster. And no terrorist talk at dinner. You're spookin' the kids.
How'd you get the information on DePinto?
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
"Sources revealed an FBI investigation into a possible money laundering scheme that may have sent millions of dollars--
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Just reporters.
That was for Christmas.
Yeah.  I wish you could've met...
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
You didn't squeeze DePinto?
Never.
That wasn't the answer I was hoping for.
Mr. DePinto? My name's Robert Dean. I'm an attorney with Seth, Silverberg.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
That's temporary.
Rachel--
You're a moron, you know that?
Who <u>are</u> you people?
I have to go lingerie shopping.
I don't under--
A leave of absence. Until we've sorted this all out.
Fuck off.
I don't under--
Why?
Did they take your clothes?
What about jewelry?
What?
Table 122?
I wrote a check for a thousand dollars. You guys didn't have a table that was in the kitchen?
Calm down.
They're framing me.
No, I--
You gotta let me bring you in to the police.
I have a family.
I honestly don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
Then what's your goddam opinion?
Zavitz had digital compression equipment. He could've downloaded into something. A disk, a chip, anything small enough to put in his pocket and run with. Whatever he put it in, he dropped it in that bag.
Fuck you.
He's dead. An accident. Hit by a bus.
Am I to understand--
He never made it to the newspaper, but there was private sector contact.
Get it.
So they know everything.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
What's your ETA?
Federal Express for 'Zavitz'.
He's carrying the damn <u>flag</u>.
As the wife of one of our party.
We took several photographs, there's no need.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Don't.
What do you hate most?
A lie.  What do you hate most?
I can't work.  I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Shall we be all right?
What?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Yes.  Absolutely.
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Do you have your papers, sir?
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Which we've overflown twice.
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government.  They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears.  In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis.  So if you need it…hard to know how long one's talking about.  We might all be back in a month or two.
Okay.
You're the prettiest girl I ever saw.
Please don't creep around this house.
She can take you as far as Florence.
Me?  You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
Top Hat.
Very true!
Me?
The rest meant nothing to me.
Well, she is!
But finally able to explore the Cairo night-life. I shall produce an authoritative guide to the Zinc Bars and - I want to say Harems - am I in the right country for Harems?
Right.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Almásy smiles and walks on towards the others.
I won't hear of it.  None of us will.
Have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
I can already see.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
I can see my wife in that view.
Could I have a cigarette?
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Thank you.  Thank you.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
Would you like me to?
Hana, I know you do!
Yes, for your hair.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
I follow the wires.
The lamp was burning all night in his room.  Caravaggio was there with him.
It's what I've learned.
I'll always go back to that church.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
This is making me incredibly angry.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
I looked up to you, Uncle.  My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
I think so.  Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
Exactly.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
I don't know, but close.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
But--
I'm not the one to ask...
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
True enough.
Our equipment has arrived.
Hmmm.
Yes you did.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
You can't be too careful.
Got it.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
You don't know the half of it.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
Surgically attached.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
Have really held you under?
Oh, I don't care about the money.
Four billion dollars.
They drive so recklessly there.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
We're supposed to.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
Probably not.
Erin, you've been here three weeks.  If you don't know how to do your job by now, I am not about to do it for you.
You're kidding, right?  Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG&E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Yes?
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
Oh.  Huh.  Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing.  A lady has some property next to a PG&E plant that PG&E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
That's not how we work here.  You don't just leave a message and take off.
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
So you think we got 'em scared?
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
You think there's more?
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family.  Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it.  I'll take it on.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
And it's less than pocket change for PG&E.
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Look, you said you weren't feeling great.  I thought you should rest.
You're emotional.  You're erratic.  You say any God damn thing that comes into your head.  And I'm not saying that's bad.  That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
And if you had to guess ...
When?  Where?
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
How do you know that?
Corey.
Good.
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
Ross.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Yeah, I'm gonna start sleeping here.  Masry & Vititoe, can I -- damn it.  Does anyone know anything about these phones?
Well I hate it.
I'm gonna go live with George.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
You got more than one?
You need help with your kids?  I could probably do that.
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Right.
Better safe than sorry.
What do you mean?
It's a simple thing.  Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
What?  But you been working so hard --
Nothing.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Ai, bueno.  Because I didn't want to tell you before, with your worries --
What?
They've both got some immune system problem. Can't say what from, whether it's viral or genetic or what, but something's wrong.  And these guys -- Donna and Peter --
We've come this far ... He is our only hope.
You are the last Jedi, Luke.  You are our only hope.  Be patient.
The boy is our last hope.
Luke ... you are the only hope.
Right.
No, I'm alright.  I'm alright.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
Can't get your ship out?  Have you tried?  Have you tried?
Mudhole?  Slimy?  My home this is.
Patience.  It's time to eat.
Look, it smells good.  I'm sure it's delicious   But I don't know why we can't see Yoda now.
It's the Jedi's time to eat, too.
We'll have to go out on Tauntauns.
I have felt it.
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
You're an extraordinary fighter. I hate to lose you.
Go tell your precious Princess ... Luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
The energy shield is down.  We'll be stuck here forever.
You said you were going to stay. What happened?
That bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
We are fighting for a cause much ...
Now don't panic.  We don't know that.
Wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
Right.  I'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
Where have I heard that before?
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Then we have to find a safe port around here.  Got any ideas?
Are you kidding?
I'll bet.
I forget nothing, Calrissian. Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
You may call me Leia.
And when do you betray us again?
I understand.
I'll be back later.
If I might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
You will be, my young one.  Heh. You will be.
That would matter not were The Force flowing through you.  Higher you'd jump!  Faster you'd move! Open yourself to The Force you must.
What's in there?
Only what you take with you.
Free your mind and return he will.
My mind fills with so many images.
They look pretty docile.
He's a gorilla.
Humans?
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
I tried...
My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
Say goodnight, Carjack.
We get the girl and the prototype. And we get out.
I don't know yet.
That's the deal.
Defense against what?
It's history. I gotta go.
Cuervo Jones' right-hand man. One tough hombre. You don't understand, Snake. Cuervo Jones wants to unify the island. We're on the move, man. Big time.
Looking to get out.
Which way?
Where?
Who?
Sewers. Come on.
The freeway.
No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
Not a boast, sir, but a curse.  Never have I met my match in joust or duel.
I will not. You must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of God.
I, the best knight in the world, bested! This is a great day, for my search is over. I love you, my King.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
Yes, yes, I know that. Everybody does. Lord Leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. I can't lose him.
I had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so I could get some honey, and I didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. Anyway, I was in less danger than you'll be in today.
You know full well there is, and I go to meet it now. Come witness my revenge.
--Stories... You brought me back. Your love brought me back. Back to where you are now, in the land of dreams...
Is this a dream? Tell me, Merlin!
Well, then, I shall tell you which knights have maiden daughters, so you can avoid their castles.
Don't start a war on my wedding day!
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
You.
To me? But why?
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
The deepest secrets, the forbidden formulas...
That I cannot.
And what about the exorcist? Any ideas?
How about Lankaster Merrin.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
Thank you your excellency.
Dinner at the White House.
Maybe the circuit is busy?
I can't believe it.
Not that I know of.
I just heard them Karl.
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
I'm Father Karras.
That's okay. I should've told you I wouldn't be in uniform.
He didn't mention?
Yeah well, it just so happens that somebody very close to me is probably possessed, and needs an exorcist.
Please.
The closet
You know how?
Oh I love you.
Yeah I like him. Don't you like him? Hey what's going on? What is this?
Your not gonna marry him are you?
Oh, honey.
St. Mike's.
Karras.
What we missed in the EEG and the arteriogram could conceivably turn up there. At the least, it would eliminate certain other possibilities.
That's an insult, I got a vow of poverty.
There was nothing you could do. Lye down. C'mon.
I came to say goodbye.
How's the girl?
In time. But mirabile dictu, don't you agree?
Ego te abslovo.
La plume de ma tante.
Amen
I think the point is to make us dispair... To see our selves as... animal and ugly... To reject the possibillity that God could love us.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
Only what I read in the papers.
Papers. Tell me, what do you know about the subject of witchcraft? From the witching end, not the hunting.
Maybe. Some rituals used in Black Mass. Maybe.
And Dennings, you read how he died?
Unlikely.
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Very much.
Who?
...in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ!!! It is he who commands you! He who flung you from the heights of Heaven to the depths of hell!
Are you a relative?
Yes.
They're falling out.
How many?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
Come on, friend.  I can smell it on you. Get yourself a cup of coffee.  You'll forget what you're angry about.
In the attic.  Behind some of Dad's stuff.  Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
Jack.
Jack.
Jack...
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
Really.  You sleeping?
So do I.
I don't gotta go.
What?
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
Just like the day of the auditions, right?  Jesus.  How's my hair?
Get out of here.
I'll hit you, Frank.  I swear.
Jack, for crying out loud.  Your bachelorhood's showing.  Ah, here we go.
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth.  All three-day turns.
Two years ago.  March.
Last?
A few bars!
Yeah.
I don't know.  I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal.  Is it?  A big deal?
Right.  I love you, Frank.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
I could've.  But he didn't want me to.
What disease?
What?
No, fuck you.  And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink.  But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Good choice.
Daughter's.  Sweet sixteen.
A cab?  Ma, come on.  My car's just a half block down.  You wait here.
What do you mean?
What about me?
Changed?
Hey!
All right, but make it quick.  Shoes!  What size do you wear?
Did you hear it?
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Well then ... shall we?
Huh?
They are in tune.  But not with each other.
Is that important?
Thanks.
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
You want me to walk you?
Forget it.
So why's he do it?
It's okay.  Last one.
Can't sleep?
Guess I got a little scattered.
I'm not upset.
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
So, what happened?
Yeah.  Got my own sign.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
I guess it's getting serious.
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
I'm not much for sweets.
... Thanks.
Jon, he's hooked up to a full-spectrum polygraph. No one has ever beaten --
The last time I took orders from you I ended up with five years probation.
You porked his wife the day he was arrested.  How could you forget that?
Only one you've never broken.
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be.  You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
Must've been after we got engaged.
Were you there to catch me?
And you wouldn't be.
One last time.  It's important ...
-- Or maybe all at once.  There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families.  He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
The bomb.  He's reactivated it.  And everyone there is going to die.
That's what they always say.
You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her?  When was the last time you two had sex?
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You're under arrest. Incredibly, you still have the right to remain silent --
You can't kill me, Jon. I've got something going this Saturday night ... it's gonna be worse than anything God ever dumped on the Pharaohs -- and only I can stop it.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
What makes you so sure this guy's gonna set up his own brother?
Castor Troy almost strangled me to death.  Where the hell were you?
Yeah, mom cut me some slack -- but I decided ... I'd like to be here for you.  Here, mom.  You can have it back.  Thanks, though.
Get rid of them.
What?
You can't blame me for trying.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
Normally, I would.  But today ...
No.  Most of them are in transit by now.  I'm heading over to the hotel to personally oversee security.
Okay, then.  I leave it in your able hands.
The hospital?  Oh, that's right -- you're a doctor.  Ha-ha.
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
I'm not going anywhere.
... That's great.
Jon, it's the tenth.  I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
Okay, if you insist. But -- you drive.
Great.
Great?  He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
-- Studying.
So you left her?  Just like that?
God, no.  I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
And look where it's led you...  I'm gonna get her on the phone...
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Big Ed’s.
Right.  That’s a major oversight...  So if I’m Kate...I can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I’m trapped in suburbia...
I don’t think so.
She is relentless.
Pretty much.
So could you write down her exact address?
All I’m saying it there isn’t a guy in Union County who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
I mean it.  From what I can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
You still think this is about me, don't you?
No?  C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
I glimpse?  A glimpse of what!?  What glimpse?! Glimpse!
I asked you a direct question!  A glimpse of what?!
Because you got to figure it out for yourself.  Are you listening to me?
Thanks.  To you too...
Uh...sure Jack...  Right back there...
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
If you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
What?
Yeah...fine.
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
Trust me on this Kate.  I really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Why not?
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
Do what?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  C’mon, take it off.  We’ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
Excuse me?
If you want to look at it that way...
Wait a minute.  You’re my wife?
How do you even know about this place?
But I’ve done some good things too, haven’t I?
You’ve been Jack Campbell.  And that’s always a good thing...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
Jesus, Jack...
Jack.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Thank you, Betty.  I know if I can just sleep this off, I’ll be fine...
You won’t regret it...  Tommy!  Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T/A’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Kate? No, there’s no one here named Kate.  Is that good enough for you?
Is there anything I can do for you?
Yes!
Trust me, this ain't one of those times.
We got what we wanted.  That's <u>enough</u>.
This makes five.
This is your dream, Reed.  You should be the one up there.
He's smart, powerful, successful --
Yeah.  You don't wanna know the details.
O-kay.  We'll skip that question.
Yeah, well, his eyes say different.
Hey, two hearts got busted last time. Maybe she's not over it either.
Back on Earth.  Victor's medical facility... We're in quarantine.
They're fine.  Everybody <i>else</i>...is fine.
Give me a mirror...
Baby, you're scaring me.
About me?  How sweet.
<u>What</u> did he do to the uniform?!
Just give Reed a little more time. You know how he works -- analyzing every little step before he takes one --
I wish I could tell you.  I can't pretend to know what we're dealing with here.  I'll notify the CDC and --
My shift ends at four, but I couldn't --
No: You're <u>ON FIRE</u>!
Okay, "mom."
That's the temperature of the <u>sun</u>.
Is that what you call it?  "<i>Real</i>"?
But Johnny...you <u>can't fly</u>.
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
Get a grip.  Reed.  We didn't come all this way to lose our nerve at the first little glitch.  Just close the shields...
Reed, we're running out of time.
Not much.  We need to run tests to see the extent of the damage.
Yes, thanks.
No, I distinctly remember: <u>you</u> walked out <u>my</u> door.  Ergo...
I think it was a little more complicated than --
I just wanted to share an apartment. What was so complicated about that?
The plants, from space.  Their particles are still charged.  With the right amount of energy, those ions could <u>create</u> the elemental profile of the cosmic storm.
And you sure you can control this thing?  Last time didn't work out so well.
He was going to take away all my data, equipment --
Well, when you're looking at your future, it never hurts to find closure about the past.
Victor, we <u>can't do anything</u> until the research is ready.
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Skeptical...?
Medical's ready.
That would give us only three seconds to revive him...
Along the Optic Nerve to the Eye.
Before he could breathe a word. He's the only scientist who knows the answer to what we're after. That's why we have to operate --
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
And take a little trip with them...
Well, the only way to reach that clot is from inside the Brain. So we've decided to put a Surgical Team and a Crew into a submarine -- reduce it way down in size, and inject it into an Artery --
But I don't want to be Miniaturized -- !
It's only for an hour --
Not even for a minute! General Carter, sir, I'd like you to reconsider your choice. I'm just not the right man for a mission of this kind.
Difficult? He's impossible!
And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
Yes, there's no time to spare. And those fibers can be quite tenacious.
Thank you for volunteering.
They're much smaller than bacteria...
I'll take some Laughing Gas, ma'am.
I think it's the most exciting --  We're going to see things no one ever saw before. The actual physical process of Life itself -- not something under a microscope... Just think of it --
You may learn to like it.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
I can't breathe!... I've got to get out!
I don't agree. I think we ought to stop and take a sample.
A simple exchange, Mr. Grant. Corpuscles releasing carbon dioxide -- the moment they touch the Wall of the Lung -- in return for oxygen coming through from the other side.
Then why not take it?
If I can relieve the pressure on a few key vessels...
It's too late!
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Yes... We can go forward on this course, but it means going directly through the Heart.
I'm afraid there's only one thing we can do. Call off the mission.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
There's no other way. Tie my safety line to the sub.
Two in a row?
It's possible --
I always had an idea there was only one System. The Circulatory.
Go ahead.
Remind me to ask you about the love life of an octupus.
Berserk nothing. He's the one who's been sabotaging the mission...  Get this on. Hurry!
What do you mean?
Well, see, there's a minimum charge of four dollars. Long-term parking charges by the day.
Unghh... oh, geez...
Certainly -
Certainly.
What's this, sir?
What?
Whoa, Daddy.
We split that.
Yah.
Blood has been shed, Jerry.
What the heck d'ya mean?
We need more -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Okay, real good, then.
One hundred! You lied to me, Mr. Lundegaard. You're a bald-faced liar!
Yah, I don't need no sealant though.
End a April.
He's three now. Course, not in that picture.
And then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. So I don't say nothin' and he says, 'What do ya think about that?'  So I says, 'Well, that don't sound like too good a deal for him then.'
White Bear Lake?
Oh sure. They say she's gonna turn cold tomorrow.
First one's a trucking company, second one's a private residence.  A Shep Proudfoot.
Chaska.
Uh-huh.
A subconscious-type thing.
Hold on.
Jerry, we're not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
No, no. See - they, no, see, they only deal with me. Ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they're very - these guys're dangerous -
Dad! What're they doing? Wuddya think they're doin' with Mom?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
Yah, I see.
But the deal's already done, I already got the money -
Yah, well, they exist all right.
I'm sure they do - ha ha! But I can't read their serial numbers here. So if you could read me -
Well, yah, I got an idea. How's that Ciera workin' out for ya?
...Who they playin'?
Yah, you said you'd have a think about it. I understand it's a lot of money -
What's goin' on there?
No kiddin'?
No kiddin'! I'd need the cash pretty quick there. In order to close the deal.
Ah, dammit!
The heck d'ya mean?
No, see -
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
Uh-huh.
Oh, geez. It's quarter to eleven.  I hope I dint wake you.
Yah, that's me.
Well, how the heck are ya?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
Yah... Yah, yah. Geeze, Margie!
I'm sorry, Mike.
Oh, ya know, that's, uh - what can I say?...
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
Uh-huh.
Yah, is this Marge?
This is Mike Yanagita. Ya know - Mike Yanagita. Remember me?
...Mike Yanagita!
No.
No. No. No. They weren't - he, uh, he was bothering Linda for about, oh, for a good year.  Really pestering her, wouldn't leave her alone.
Sorry - didn't copy.
Oh. Gary's loudmouth.
I love you, Norm.
And his wife?
He's at -
Sir, you're disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
There's no one else here.
Look at my face.  I'm a member.  I just need to know if you've seen Tyler Durden.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Really?  Great.  Still "Remaining Men Together?"
You want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
You want to see pain?  Swing by First Methodist Tuesday nights.  See the guys with testicular cancer.  That's pain.
You can't have the whole brain!
Like testicular cancer?
Good.
Uh ... nah.
Guy or girl?
Marla, it's me.  Have we... have we ever had sex?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye.  The stink was unbelievable.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I've done you enough favors.
I deserve that.  Anyway, I've... I've only just realized
What?
...And you open the door and you step inside.  We're inside our hearts.  Now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  That's right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
Tyler Durden.
No, supply oxygen?
Why?  So you can say, "Oh, that's what you do." -- And be a smug little shit about it?
Thank you.
Keep it up, then.  Keep it right up.
Delivered from Swedish furniture.
I don't... think so.
Why don't you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
Would that be a problem?
What?
You get the idea.
Is it?
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
Hum.
Oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
Shut up.  Our fathers were our models for God.  And, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about God?
Nothing.  Do what you like.
I heard.  Local 15, Monday nights.
Homework assignment.
Tell him!
What should I have told you?
You're asking questions that don't have answers.  You know just as much about Project Mayhem as anybody else.
Fuck my life.  Fuck fight club.  Fuck you and fuck Marla.  I'm sick of this.  How's that?
Nothing.
... is over.
You can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
You never talked to me in front of anyone else.
You have jobs.
Green?  Did you say green?
Bob is dead, Tyler.  The police blew a hole in his head.  Was that part of your plan?
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
What have you left for me?
We have a deal worked out with Irvine.
It's free to all.
Pleeeeeease!
How'd you know?
Please, God, no...
I... I don't know...
Too much school.
Death's list.  The precise order you're going to die in.
You were there?
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
We need to hurry.
If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be...
She had the baby?
Carter.
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimberly.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Do you remember what triggered it all?
Then you believe all this??  That Death is working off a list?
That's crazy.  You can't give up now.  We can still fight this thing.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Relax, Dad.  It's Daytona, not Mongolia.
I mean it.  Take care of it.
I will, Dad.  Bye, luv you.
It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you.
Like... 4:25.
Nothing is... anymore.
Get out! Get out of the car!
That's why It skipped Carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; Billy.
Why do you think I was hiding?
That's a plan.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
No harm. No foul.
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
Maybe because you're shot in the leg.
Ninety.
Show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
Read you.
Modified M-16 A2 and over-under M-79 grenade launcher, with Sionics sound suppressor, Tracor starlight scope and LAC/R-100 Laser sighting system.
How come we didn't just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
Let me see.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
I suppose you have...
Oh.  They talk to me at university before fall of Saigon.  Make deal.
Where's his father?
Yes.  But I lose many merits in next life.  Very bad.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
In-vul-nerabo.  But you get ass kicked without me.
Yeah.  Got some business there. What are you gonna do?
How?
I'm not jumping blind.
We just take pictures?
He... took it.
POWs?  I don't know.  But either way it'll get that subcommittee off our necks.  Cream?
It's not necessary.
There were treating me like a headcase.
Those men are all dead.
What did you want?
No, thank you.
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
You're all right... you sure...
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit.  Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
The moron?
What does that mean?
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
<u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!
No, I have to work.
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Yes.  They're free.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
I'm the one what?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I'm on a very special quest.
The Little...
I know...
Funny -- you look married.
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
That's why the Little People sent you. Just <u>like</u> magic.
It's a classic.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts.  This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
Bingo!
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
You advise us!
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh no, I want to.  I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night.  I have a confession to make?
Shhh...
Your little friend's real sharp there...  Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
That's right, hand.
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I'm not going to get up an' leave you.  Now let's go over to El's an' have a good time.
I'll tell you...  ... l-a-t-e-r.
Oh, you're not going to kill yourself this time. I wish I'd known...
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Just finish eating.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Washington.
Yeah. That's before the big thaw.
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Are you talking to us?
Well, you seem very professional...
You know who it once belonged to?
Daddy's very ill.
No, I don't really think you're a freak.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Well, if you just maybe did something with your hair, or...
I don't know.
Why are you being so mean?
I'm not. He does walk funny. Don't you see that?
I don't know where she is!
Yeah. I said a week, and I've overstayed myself...
But what about me?
Bye, Robert.
Yes, intentionally.
It wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.
That's right.
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
Oh. You have to tell me that.
What do you mean? Aside from my neck, I'm in superb shape.
That's what I mean...
At game, Carl.
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing...  Is there any ketchup around?
Away from the piano, Tita, you have no sense of time at all.
I hope I didn't hear that.
I took some aspirin and it really upset my stomach.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
You better hold onto your tongue!
What do you mean "mass"... I have to come out and tell you, you're not that clean, either.
I strongly doubt it, but I wasn't really discussing media...
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
So get the fuck outta here.
Victor.
You know. I got a lot, more than one.
Yeah! Tell me which one you would like. To be doin' nothin on a fire escape or beat the pool with a bunch of girls? Be straight up!
Natasha, Maria, Tina-
I think by Twenty-two.
For real?
How old is he?
Um, yeah I think so.
You sure?
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
What?
You live around here?
Whaddyamean 'maybe'?
I ought to get some sleep.
We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want... Jane Doe?
You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
Go ahead. Make my evening.
Put the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.
I said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go home and I'll call you tomorrow.
That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
Mrs. Smith.
Joan or Margaret Smith.
Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
There is?
Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
For sure?
Right. Fine.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
Till then.
California. San Berdoo. Utah's part of my route. Can I ask you a few questions?
Check.
Then he has.
Of course they are.
What are you doing here?
I know.
Cops are here. I can smell them. They're after me. Lie down, Gum.
Why not?
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Come inside.
My company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. And I have a wife. Suicide would nullify my insurance. Murder does not.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
His bride. Cute as a button.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one!
I mean put clothes on.
'I've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
Good point.
Oh, listen to me. I've never even been there and look what I say about it. Anyway, I know there'd be nothing for me to do. I don't even know anybody there.
I think you should call me Gail, now.
But I've seen the deed.
Just give me twenty-four hours. Please. Someone almost killed me today. People are not being nice lately, and I don't want you getting hurt. I think you're terrific. Are you a Laker fan?
What are you talking about?
I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow.
Charged to the Underhills, sir?
Yes, sir. Beluga. But it is eighty dollars the portion.
I recommend it.
Very good, sir.
What?
This morning? Christ. We had so much to talk about. Moe Green is out of the Tropicana, and my sons, Michael and Fredo, are taking over.
I have pictures of him. Dealing...
It's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
I want something I can print!
Print this Frank.
Not really.
Not really?
My secretary.
In a minute!
Don't say it.  Orange juice?
Please.
What did these Vancouver factories do?
Exactly.
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Yeah, let's bury her.
I don't know.  I'm so scared. Help me.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
How is it you can look at that HairHead and see God, when all I see is a lucky asshole from Reseda.
You know rock-n-roll?  Darlin', I've been in the music industry for as long as you've lived.  I've seen things you can't even have nightmares about... but then I guess I'm just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
Ye-ah.
Ye-ah.
Yeah, Ford.  I'm okay.
Who cares?  I got a case.
Did he just say what I think he said?
Shut up, you dummy.  Who did this to you?
Get the fuck out of here, honey... What do we got?
Like me.
Actually that's rather an intriguing idea...
I was just discussing this whole Vomit thing with my friend Art Mooney.  Do you know him?
I must say you're an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
Are you okay?
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Fucking amazing, huh?  Chevy Nova, you Bensonhurst shit!  Still in La-la land.  Look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  Unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
Nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you Redhook bastard.
There's nothing around.  Nobody's holding.
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Takin' care o' business, honey.
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
What?
Not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  The police know you brought the car into the country.  This makes you an accomplice.
That's a relief.
Look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  Like a bowstring.  It was built from both ends.  With no support in the middle.  Beautiful.
Names.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
Morning.  Sometime.
Look.  My partner and I found this case and I don't want no Feds screwing it up.
Hunh-uh.  Check the bread.  He spreads it like the Russians are in Jersey.
Makin' wine in the basement.  He looks like that wop stooge used to drive for the Fracisi brothers.
I'm wounded.  Oh, oh.
We also got Bill Mulderig and Phil Klein.
Pour it in your ear.
Hiya, Jesus.
Whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
Why is it called Hellgate?
What was it?
Let me tell you what I know, Daryl.  You went to Saint Xavier with Mary.  You lived five blocks from her.  You liked her.  But she ain't interested.  That must've hurt, huh?
I'm alright, Gibby.
One way to find out.
I tucked him in at Gordo's.
I love you more.
Wish you weren't.
I know.  He loves that thing.
No.  Not our Johnny.  I mean, it's Johnny...but not now...in the future.
Yeah, but, no kidding around, he's a good guy, a real good guy...
John, hold on a second.  I'm in the middle of something important here.  You mind if...
He's not gonna stop, Satch.  He's gonna keep on...
Are you listening to me?  You're in a world of shit.  An eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  We got your prints all over the place.  Plus the fucking driver's license, Frank.  You gotta give me something here. Something I can believe.
The next batter, Clendenon, hits one outta the park.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Satch, you gotta listen to me...
Nothing...I just spilled something.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I'm trying to be, Dad.  I'm tyrin'.  It's good to hear your voice.  I missed you...so much.
Dad...Dad... There's... I need to...
It's Mom.
Jesus Christ...that's...ten days from now.  How?
I'll warn them.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
Did you see him?  Do you know who he is?
How?
Wow.
You there?
H-hi.
No.
What...
Longbranch...?
She made up her mind.  Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
This case just got hot.  We pull on this string...
Uh, huh.
Glad you did.  Come on in.  Buy you a cup of coffee?
Oh.  Sorry.  How so?
You have the right to speak to an att --
It's a small world, Carl.  And I'm gonna find you.  Real soon.
Going?  How do you mean?
Yes, you can.  Come on, Shelly!
I vote for me.
This is all the exercise I need...
I can't even remember what day it is, man.
A hammock?
Nothing.
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
Why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  It'll mellow you out.
After you left me that night, I didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  No one would tell me anything.  All I know is what the police told me.  We have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  What happened?
It's all right, you're all right. I'm with you.
Maybe.
Just keep your eyes on the road.
Don't say any more.
I never said you were "nothing".
Better call an ambulance first.
This is a man's game.  Requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Daddy, what is going on?
Uh...yes.  But...
Either you go to sleep or I'll come in there and put you out.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
How many times has Jason been reported killed before, Mr. Campbell?
I'm kind of busy right now...
You need to leave.
I'm just too old for going steady, Josh.
Maybe you should mind your own business.
She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
I'm sorry.  I have to bring you to a cell.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
I know what it sounds like.
She did!
She did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  Didn't she?!
Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
I mean really never.
You're joking, right?
What? Don't be a lightweight...this is top dollar toot.
Nobody related to McCulloch can be nice.
Yeah.
Ask me in about five minutes.
Tell me.
What?? You sent her out there with a murderer running around loose??
We have to get off this ship!!
Then I'll make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.
But I haven't even shown you my biology project...
Nothing! I went to her cabin and...
Perfect for a swim, isn't it?
I'll take some lessons this time. I promise.
Am I? Let's find out.
I...I can't...
Really?
Yeah...a lot.
I gathered that.
But I didn't get you one...
If I go with you, he'll never speak to me again.  But I'm never going to live up to his expectations anyway...so maybe it's the right thing to do.
What do you mean???
Big mess every time.
You are going where?
What do you mean, we must abandon?
I drove twelve hours straight through. Ate at the wheel.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Press a button and they give us money.
That's awful.
I recite it to myself with masochistic relish.
I say we go.
What about the haircut?
Where is it?
This could be it.
This could be it.
This could be it.
I hear Alan's sick.
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
About what?
What?
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
It can't be all that personal.
This is how we've managed to last.
It's your best play, Nicky.
Take it yourself. Take a date.
I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.
Two-all after six.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
I'm a man. She's, you know, a woman.
It violates so many trusts.
Life is real.
Where the hell are you?
Where does Nicky get his hair cut?
Get yourself something to eat.
They're only gonna lose.
It's one thing for kids. You get older, you Nhave other things.
Where's your elastic brace?
I think the building's okay. At least for the time being.
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars.  Where's your white Lincoln limo?
It's the kid's lucky day.
That's my cousin, Angelo.
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
Matthew.
If they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. It's all over.
appreciate that, Sidney. But our leading man can't remember his lines. And his understudy can't carry the play.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
That's the line I can't ever, for the life of me remember. I just can't get it.
A little.
Endearing.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
Is it true?
But you're his friend.
He's a very sweet man.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
I'm actually beginning to enjoy this.
But you're here. So you must have come to me.
There's no room! And the air is lovely.
No. That is what you get for distracting me.
A -- a week.
Well, I've called you here because I've had a chance to see the new legislation. It's exactly what was rumored. Arrest without warrant. Automatic imprisonment for possession of materials considered seditious...
The fools!  Sorry...
I assure you I feel a very ordinary man at this moment.
He's "discovering" India.
It would be five thousand more.
Of course, Sir.  We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--I've already run it.  There's no record of any living relative.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Something's not right.
Get it.  From outside, if you have to.
Where did you get this?
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
God, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
Hey, how much of you can be there?  Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week--  you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
Keep going!!  Keep going!!
Any particular reason?
In a corridor.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
I'm sure I could have.
I was never very good at it, remember?
Not bad, Jerome.
I'm travelling too.
Why are you inventing problems?  You two are a couple of goddam clones.  You look so right together, I want to double my fee.
Why not?
We could go together one day.
New policy.
No, you don't understand.  I <i>can't</i>.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
No way. I always do my own work.
You still don't get the picture do you? I've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
One. The radio's rappin' about $750^000. We only got a half a million.
No.  My old lady must have made a lot of promises.
Yeah.
How's Estelle?
Really.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things
Do you mean that?
I mean it.
When they find it, they find it.
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Like what?
I think you liked it with him.
El Paso.
Sure...
Listen to me. It's hard enough.
I guess you're right.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
Jeep. There's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. He takes us to the Mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
So what?
Hell, I don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
We walk.
Oh my God.
It's just a walk-in bank. You don't have to be Dillinger for this one.
Why not?
That's what I want.
I dunno. He's got his ways. He knows Margaret.
What's it got to do with you?
This is my brother's car.
Fine. Nowt wrong with them.
I made a mistake.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
What about?
But he was just another feller, wasn't he?
Though nicer than most?
You know Sid Fletcher?
Who?
Really?
He was here for four days.
No. I didn't know that.
To the demon king's castle, of course.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Entertaining.
What kind of entertaining?
What girl?
I don't know.
Yeah.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Working at Woolworths.
You coming to South America?
At me friend's house.
Right.
Who's Brumby?
All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
It's not like that, luv.
Will this do?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Is he staying the night?
You're lucky. They kill as well.
What about Keith?
Pension him off.
I don't want to get rough, do I?
I'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'Rule, Britannia'.
No, I didn't know that.
Yeah,  Come off it, Eric. Who is it?
Yes, I retained that, Eric.  Do you know a man called Albert Swift, Eric?
He's thinking Sid and Gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
The gun he means.
That's right, Harry.
Three hundred altogether?
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
Deadbeats all.
I had to.
You had to, yeah.  Why?
Well, I think I had one once.
They killed the goose.
They did.
...this shit...
Eh?
It's too...
I, I...I...
Some contest board...
No.
...that's right...
No.
That's right...
No.
You build it!
They...
I want to tell you what somebody should do.
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
Yes.
You haven't talked to him.
No, we're just...
Well.  Well...
No.  Not actually.
Have I said that?
What will he pay?
A buck a shot.
That's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  After the thirtieth. Murray and Mitch.  After the contest.
Yes.
You wouldn't, George, that's why I'm talking to you.  Answer me. They come to you.  You going to turn me in?
Yes.  I'm sure.
In the abstract...
Why?
They're ancient.
Clear...
Everything I...you know...
That's not...Fuck that shit, George. You're a, hey, you had a bad month. You're a good man, George.
I am?
Yeah.  That's swell.  Another waste of time.
No.
Yes.
Will you excuse us please?
Uh, uh, did he go to the restaurant?  I...I... 
Rick, I'm going to flag a cab.
...that's why I came in.  I thought I...
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
...no...
It isn't me...
Let me...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
What if you don't?  Then I'm fucked. You see...?  Then it's my job. That's what I'm telling you.
Bullshit.  They ain't been in the office yet.  Give 'em some stiff. We have a deal or not?  Eh?  Two sits.  The Des Plaines.  Both of 'em, six and ten, you can do it...six and ten...eight and eleven, I don't give a shit, you set 'em up?  Alright?  The two sits in Des Plaines.
Get 'em to me!
Yes, I am.
What are you talking about?
No.  It hadn't.
If you tell me where the leads are, I won't turn you in.  If you don't, I am going to tell the cop you stole them, Mitch and Murray will see that you go to jail.  Believe me they will.  Now, what did you do with the leads?  I'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
Five thousand.  I kept half.
Who kept the other half?
John: John:...my daughter...
"'Why?  Why don't I get the opportunities...?"
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
That's right, Shel.
Well, we'll do that this weekend.
Which...
"Home Cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,
Home cooking...
Well, it isn't coming out until the February iss...sure.  Sure, go ahead, Ricky.
Go ahead.
Kenilworth...?
I'm sorry...?
Mm.
I've got to get Ray to O'Hare...  Come on, let's hustle...  John!  Call American Express in Pittsburgh for Mr. Morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock. 
Why did she do that, Jim?
To change our minds.
But we have to before Monday.  To get our money ba...
Yest...
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
Forget the deal, Jimmy.  Forget the deal...you know me.  The deal's dead.  Am I talking about the deal?  That's over.  Please. Let's talk about you.  Come on.  Come on.  Come on, Jim.  I want to tell you something.  Your life is your own.  You have a contract with your wife.  You have certain things you do jointly, you have a bond there...and there are other things.  Those things are yours.  You needn't feel ashamed, you needn't feel that you're being untrue...or that she would abandon you if she knew.  This is your life.  Yes.  Now I want to talk to you because you're obviously upset and that concerns me.  Now let's go. Right now.
And the check is...
You hear what I said?
Sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
What is this, your farewell speech?
They didn't get my contracts.
Did they...
It went down.  I filed it.
To the restaura...what do you fucking...?
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
It was nothing...I was assuring Mr. Lingk...
Your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  And we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
On your pillow.
I can't.
Michael...
Tom is right.
I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns!
You would risk your life for strangers?
Not for strangers; for my country.
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
Great, Havana's great.  Lots of activity in Havana!  Anybody I know here.  Five-Angels?  Anybody?
No.  No, I didn't.  Who tells me anything?  I been kept in the dark so long, I'm getting used to it.
That's what I'm here for.
It was hard to have him killed.
It was Frankie tried to have me hit.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
But, you told me yourself...
A pig of a Neaponitan. 
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I don't know.  I'm sorry, Kay...
I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me.
I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on.
Sure, Mikey.
But if you're wrong...
The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York.
Wait... there's something else.
Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby.
I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible...
Mike wants it.
No questions.
How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself?
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
You paid off thirty grand I never owed.
I'm going to the market.
Kay, you've got it wrong.  That kind of thing's all over, I promised you.  This was between the two brothers.  Years ago Frankie had a young girlfriend; he called her his co-wife.  That was his joke, but he meant it.  He wouldn't divorce his wife... because she was a great cook.  He said he girlfriend made a spaghetti sauce once and it was so terrible he knew he could never marry her.  He set her up in a house in Jersey.  She had to be faithful... and she had to have kids. And she did, two, a boy and a girl. He had her checked out and watched so she couldn't cheat... but the girl couldn't stand that kind of life.  She begged him to let her go. He did.  He gave her money and made her give up the kids.  Then Frankie took them to Italy, and had them brought up by his brother Vincenzo. Where he knew they'd by safe.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless.  You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
Alright.  They bother me once in awhile.  Tell me, when Pop had troubles... did he ever think, even to himself, that he had gone the wrong way; that maybe by trying to be strong and trying to protect his family, that he could... that he could... lose it instead?
Not for a few years.
Then it's done.  I must choose his replacement: it cannot be Rosato.
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
Except the President of the United States.
Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched.
They feel cheated.
This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me.
Let's forget the bullshit, I don't want to stay here any longer than I have to.  You can have the license for two hundred and fifty thousand in cash, plus a monthly fee equal to five percent of the gross...
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
We worked it all out beforehand.
Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club.
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
That's a lucky C note for our new deal.
Eh...  Five dollars more.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
What was that?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
You liked it too.
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone?  Pathetic and alone.
Yeah, I'm a good man.  Something make you think I'm not?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
I'm not married.
Of course.  I am married still.
No!
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
You are right.  Yes.  We must put him back.
Mornin'.
Broke is more like it.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
It's new.
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me?
I never thought you were.
Why not?
Do you miss it?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
You were a soldier?
I didn't --
I want -- I want...
Do I look okay?
Neither of us really belongs here.
Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
What'd you say?
What won't do?
What did you expect?  Bronze?
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
Nothing I didn't deserve.
Have a drink?
She took the night off.  Heavy date.  Some guy she's had her eye on for a while.
"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
Goodbye, Hanna.
You didn't, Jimmy.
But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air.
Well the rest of us aren't.  Can't you remember that?
Then who did?
Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
My mind's lovely.  And yours?
Of course.  This afternoon.
I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like.
One likes to live simply.
Of course.
You think so?  That's very kind --
Bet you thought you'd never see me again.  I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor?
Don't think that, Mr. Whale.  I love your movies.  That's why I wanted you to come to this.  So I could see you with your monsters.
Only hurts when I breathe. Lookit you. Where are Barney Fife and Aunt Bea hanging out? And Opie ... Where's Opie at?
Fish.
Yeah Tell him to lay off Kip and them Tell him it's on
They gave me two weeks. I wasted most of it with your brother and his crew, who not only lost what pitiful few they managed to boost, but also alerted the heat as to our endeavor, making this even more difficult to achieve ...
Get out --
He'll live. But it means your boy's behind it. Astricky was holding a list. They just faxed it to us...
You want to come along quiet?
Yes, Kip. Short for Kipling. Named for the English writer of stories about India ... He bites into his pear ... Memphis says nothing, waits ...
I don't think so, Detective ...
Cadillac.
Sure. But sometimes we got to create some numbers. The task force is run by statistics, you know ...
The other day....
Just out there. Roaming around. Building up my collection of refrigerator magnets ...
What's that?
C'mon, man ...
Donny-nothin'!
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
That's right. Only 10 exotics ...
It's arright ...
Yeah...
What does that mean -- ?
You, too, Ma...
He's in some trouble ...
You getting my checks ... ?
You remember that, Kip?
You all right -- ?
I can see that -
"Over--"  You know - I can maybe understand, since I been gone, you taking up this dumb-ass life of crime, and for that I can partly blame myself. But what is baffling to me, is how, since I been gone, you've become a complete and total moron--
You can handle it?
You can handle it?
Otto called -
De nada ...
The era when crime didn't pay --
Price of doing business...
Come here -
Move over ...
I dunno ... I keep thinking about him.
No problem -
Hey, now, Memphis... C'mon, man -
What are you doing here?
Buy you a drink?
I'm not doing it anymore. Haven't for a while. I've carved out something for myself. It's pathetic, but it's mine ...
No ...
I know. But let's prep 'em. We could stay here all night... That wouldn't be good --
Woo-woo-wooooo!
Now... I'm in ...
Nothing. Just that if I was less secure, I might think you were more into Eleanor than you are me...
Hello, Otto ...
The chop-shop... Where are the stripped cars?  The rolled-back odometers? The part bins?
The conundrum still applies, of course. The purpose of the endeavor is to rescue baby brother from imminent death and/or a life of crime. However. This cannot be successfully carried out without baby brother's considerable resources, shabby though they may be.
She left...
All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say "Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ...
I known Kip longing than you, man ...
Don't go busting my balls. Okay?
No. No. The guy from downtown.
Me? Why would I get into that shit?
I understand.
You thought I was some fucking jerk?
Paulie, I couldn't come to you. I didn't want to put you in this shit.  I was ashamed to come to you. I knew I was wrong.
Thirty-two hundred bucks. That's what he gave me. Thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. It wouldn't have paid for the coffin.
Get inside!
Are you nuts?  Jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she's such a pain in the ass. Let me tell you. Nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. They do stuff with the wrong people. They don't have things organized. You know who goes to jail? Nigger stickup men. That's who. And they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
How much?
That again.
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
It's only you and me. That's what happens when you go away. We're on our own. Forget everybody.  Forget Paulie.  As long as he's on parole he doesn't want anybody doing anything.
Never.
What did he say, exactly?
There are cops all over the place.
Who else? Paulie got the okay. This little guinea fuck. Someday he's gonna be a boss. Can you believe someday we'll work for him.
Yeah.
But I got two hundred and fifty coming.  It's my share.  Jimmy owes me.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
Tell Michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
Jesus! You must think I'm dumb. What are you bugging me for? I know what to do!
He's insulting me. Rat bastard. He's never been any fuckin' good.
Keep him here. I'm going for a bag.
Tommy  ...
Do?  What can you do?  What did you expect?  He wasn't Jewish. Did you know bow they live?  Your father would never stay out this late without calling.  In thirty years he never stayed out all night.
They won't be left back. They'll stay in their grade.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
She went to Medical school in California.
Week after I'm twenty-one.
Fuck you. You owe it to me. Tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and I'll be fifty and I'll still be doin' this. And that's all right 'cause I'm gonna make a run at it. But you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. And that's bullshit 'cause I'd do anything to have what you got! And so would any of these guys. It'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
Well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
I think you should establish a good line of credit.
--These circumstances are mitigated. Right now. They're mitigated.
No students work for me.
Yes. Under two conditions.
I'll do the work. I'm not going to meet with a therapist.
Now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, Will.  I've already spoken to one therapist, his name is Henry Lipkin and he's a friend of mine. He's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  I'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
--that?--
That's fine, but did you ever think--
Then don't set up any more meetings.
The least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
No, that's fine, Will. I was just leaving.
I was just sayin' goodbye to Sean.
I just want you to know...It's been a pleasure.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Find out what?
Pleasure to meet you.
Uh-oh.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
Good to see you.
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Just meet with the boy once a week.
I'll be okay.
What don't I understand?
Well, you're the only one.
Look Sean, I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- I don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! But don't you dare undermine what I'm trying to do here.
That's it. That's why I don't come to the goddamn reunions! Becaue I can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! You think I'm a failure! I know who I am. I'm proud of who I am. And all of you, you think I'm some kind of pity case! You with your sycophant students following you around. And you Goddamn Medal!
He won't be a failure!
Where're you going?
About thirty million to one.
Who is he?
You guys are fuckin' sick.
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
I'm sure you do. You probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
What did you think?
I did.
That must have taken you a long time.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You people baffle me. You spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
Nautilus?
Fine.
You ever think about gettin' remarried?
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
You're kiddin' me.
Not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
That's right. And you fuckin' lost! And some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
You're not going to fail me are you?
--No, have you had any experience with that?
Yes.
I know.
We're done. You did your time. You're a free man.
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
What?
The caramel thing is my pick-up line.
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
In that case, fine.  Want to see my magic trick?
Do you know all their names?
You're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
I'd say...  It's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
I guess. I don't know. How do you remember your phone number?
How do you know that?
What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
I love you, Will.  No take-backs.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
Listen, Smart Guy. I'll run my business my own way. I got work. If you wanta take it, okay. If not, just sit here, that's all.
Sure. Why not?
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
She got to make it.
I guess that's what he looked like.
What's it to you?
Them was nickel apiece candy.
Can all of you work?
Okay, mister. Whatcha payin'?
Two an' a half! Say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.
Take it or leave it. There's 200 men coming from the South that'll be glad to get it.
Better take care of it. Store manager'll give you some stuff for it in the morning. Goodnight.
Yeah. On my way home now.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Why, you're the preacher!
I got nothin' to preach about no more--that's all. I ain't so sure o' things.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
What you figger to do?
Casy! What you doin' here?
No, I done my time an' got out. Come on in. 
You ain't--you ain't sorry, are you, honey?
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Just a few miles. I'd a walked her if my dogs wasn't pooped out.
Go ahead. Ask me anything you want.
Yeah.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
I ain't talkin' about you, I'm talkin' about me. And I'm a-stayin'. I give her a good goin' over all night long-- and I'm a-stayin'.
I didn't bust out. They lemme out. Howya, Noah. Howya, Uncle John.
Ain't nothin' the matter. I just ain't a-goin', that's all.
Take her with you!
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Thought I'd take a walk. Any law against it?
I know, but I got a stomickache. I ain't hungry.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that.  That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
I can't he'p it, Ma. It don't make *me* giggly an' happy.
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna *tell* him he ain't a-goin' away.  An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
When?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
Okay, Ma. I shouldn't, though. I know I shouldn't. But okay.
I'd hate to get *trapped* in here.
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
This ain't a groc'ry store. We got bread to make san'widges with.
I shore would like to do that, ma'am, but the fack is, we ain't got but a dime for it. It's all figgered out, I mean--for the trip.
Well, give me two then, ma'am.
I can't help that. All I know is I got my orders. They told me to tell you you got to get off, and that's what I'm telling you.
Me an' you both.
Look at 'em! Same yella han'bill-- 800 pickers wanted. Awright, this man wants 800 men. So he prints up 5,000 a them han'bills an' maybe 20,000 people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' starts movin, wes' account a this han'bill. Two- three thousan' folks that's crazy with worry headin' out for 800 jobs! Does that make sense?
You do not see either!--not yet!
Whatsa matter?
You ain't to hurt them fellas.
You do not.
Don't say that.
Whatever I can get away with.
Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really.
Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands?
I want to be an actor.
Not much else.
I'm a professional killer.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
You see someone?
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
You met people.
I'll think about it.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
Could be. The physical substance of love.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
I just know.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say?  "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
Mmm.
What stuff?
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right?
And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
Like a union?
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
Not bad. You?
Hey, Bob.
It was the PLO.
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
One cannot love and kill.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
See you next week.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Paul?
That's too bad.
Good evening, Mr. Blank.
How's that?
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
Just who's been laughing at who here?
You sleeping all right in that house?
I can handle it!
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
The point was to love each other.
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
Little.
You're right. Good.
About what?
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
That's not true.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Hi.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
No, let me go.
Okay.
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Why?!
She will if you think she should.
You're allergic to hay.
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
Take your time.
What do you mean?
I don't understa-
No. I am a "tubab."
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
We have a business manager. The best around.
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
I was there for that shot, actually.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
Promise?
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
I believe women from New York eat mixed salads. Ain't that right, Tom?
Diane!
You know her?
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I know you do. Don't you disappear.  You do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
What does that mean?
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
You shut up, stupid!
I understand...
How long were you married?
Now that's cool.
Maybe I should just go to the bathroom or something.
Ain't no way, man, security's too tight. The big iron?
It was him, man!
Do you think he could hack a Gibson?
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
And unpack.
I'm the one who understands you. Now, can we be allies?
Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them!
I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone.
Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay?
How did you know that?
Okay. Let's go shopping.
I'll give it a shot.
I said give me time.
I'm Crash Override.
Yeah. It's not just the chip, it has a PCI bus. But you knew that.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
And if I win?
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Uh, hold on...
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Joey got cut off before he got to that part. Check it out. By this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
Homicidal?
I think we've got something.
However, we have come to believe that one Joey Pardella is involved in this Ellingson virus. He or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that Mr. Belford needs to disable that virus. We want you to help us find it.
The System Command Processor, it's the brain.
My name is the Plague.
Uh, Mr. The Plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
Uh, the accounting subdirectory in the Gibson is working really hard. We got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. I think we've got a hacker.
You know, you're right about that.  Check it, Friday.
Big deal. A garbage file's got shit in it, Joey, come on.
Hey, it's me.
You think they're going to bust us?
What, it left a note?
What?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Just one moment.
Okay sure. What about?
This morning.
So you hop on to the next best thing? I thought you were different from other guys.
Michael Myers.
I don't know!
Get up there Rachel!
Sometime in the night. They probably lost the road in the storm. Come down the embankment. It happens.
Not tonight. I've got that date with Brady. You know how important that is.
Its too late.
Its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
You guys always look great.
I know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably National Guard.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
I'm not calling the fire department.
Four plus Myers.
Got it Earl.
Come on Jamie, lets go back to bed.  Come on Sunday.
It's Halloween. I mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
Forget it kido. We're home by eight o'clock.
No.
No. Brady's working there till 6:00 today.
I don't want to look pushy.
You won't look pushy.
Hey. I got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. Who's gonna be next? Somebody's wife? Somebody's kid?
Are you talking about Jamie Lloyd?
All right, all right. Its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
Come on, Annie. Bob and I have been planning on it all week.
Well, I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.
Annie, you didn't. Tell me you didn't.
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Are you sure?
It's important.
I'll be here.
You have the wrong feeling.
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I found the car! He's here!
Three blocks down. Get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. I'm going up the block.
It's your own fault and I don't feel sorry for you.
Sure. Sure.
Just watch.
What about the rest of my comic books?
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.
There was no one outside.
Right.
I promise.
No! Do as I say.
Will you get her for me?
Well, go tell her it's me, okay?
I've given them his profile.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
I see.
It means... I see.
Yeah.
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
It's really terrible.
Okay.
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
We're actresses.
Really?  Is the food that bad?
Yes.
Oh, okay.
The hospital?  What kind of tests?
...with the affiliates.
How's Frederick?  He didn't come.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I'm...all right.
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
What are you doing?!
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Oh, all the time.
Uh...  I-I-I know.  I deserve this.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Aren't they great?
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk.  I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
No, nothing.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Mm-hm.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Because I have to!
What are you going to use for money?!
I'm sorry.
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
No--
If there's nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
Like what?!  What?
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
I think they're fantastic.
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test. 
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
How are you?
Like what?
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Glad you could put in an appearance.
...a little, uh, hey!  A little hug! What is this?  Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Yeah.
...so I, so I like that.  I always like an underconfident person...
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
With a, with a stranger?  With a--
The sacrifices I've made because of that man.  He's ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
Now, Holly's not shy.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Oh, he's such a loser!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What's the matter?
Yes, you do recall, right?
We didn't hit it off.
Oh, no.
Yeah, it was.
You look wonderful.  You do.  What happened to you?
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
No, you can tell me.
Nobody ever said it.
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Really?
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Where are the antihistamines?
Hmm.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me.  I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Well, okay.  Thank you very much.
You're welcome.  Hare Krishna.
A reward for what?
Would you mind saying that into your bag...?
Then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
I'm looking for...
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
Oh, Good.  The ornithological leitmotif...
No, you're wrong about Verger.
I know her by the Back.
...are they hard to get?
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison.
....I hardly <u>think</u> so... after "The Incident"...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Starling...?
A fellow with five fingers.
No, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
I never met him.  I knew him only from his writings.
Of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo?
It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist.  You have seen the chapel?
Well, if you will excuse me.  Madame. What a pleasure.
I've left my <u>program</u>...
We got KittyKat...
...who say...?
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
...but will that satisfy you?
...after you' re dead.  AND WHEN I GIVE THE WORD, do you understand...when I give the <u>word</u>...
...what has she done to harm you...?
I guess the only thing is Suck it Up...
That's what I should do.  Tell me why?
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
What do you want to do?  You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler.
Y'want to gimme Brigham's pistol?
They aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
We are here on sufferance.  I am here...
I am on the track of...
...what do you expect me to...
What shape is the scar?
Or clear your windshield with it.
They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post.
Well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  I <u>can't</u> tell you.  Cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  You haven't <u>done it</u>. And that's all there <u>is</u>.
Then, that being so, why is today special?  Why have you come back to see me?  Is it that new file they gave you?
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
Yes.
...yes...?
But they were not there.  <u>Yesterday</u>.  Is that called a Delusion...?
I have not, I would <u>not</u>.  For life  life goes on Starling.  And, wait, wait, I wish to <u>talk</u> to you... I'm...    One moment.  I was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter.  I was <u>afflicted</u> before. Before.  Do you see?  In my arrogance. Do not  Do not curse God when you are humiliated.  Listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>Listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>God</u>...
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Why are you...don't stop...why?
"Why?" If I asked questions like that, I'd never make love-"love"-- Damn you, Damn this, damnit!
Stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
You mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
I just wanted to know if you've seen this.
She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club.  Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
Wichita--you're everybody's type. But seriously, don't worry about it. I get my occasional crushes.
Stop, stop...I'm willing to put my mouth where my mouth is...I throw one overhand pass and Todd catches it-- dramatic pause--You let me go down on you...
Hello?!  What's in it for me?
Don't worry, I have 33 more days to find just the perfect moment to tell him how I...
When did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  Are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for Wichita's lightning rod?
Uh-huh.
Yeah. And?
I just never thought of you in that...
I gotta...I gotta go do a "bunk check." Or some fucking thing.
Yeah, why should we let our actual personalities get in the way of us falling in love?
Probably.
Iunno.  Of course I believe you. It's so you...I didn't think it was possible                        ] for you to make me feel worse,                              ] but...you're saying you <u>deliberately</u>                        ] destroyed us!

That's okay. Your Mom said you had a big date. Heck, I'd probably skip my own birthday party for a date.
Phil Collins? Are you sure he isn't drinking and driving?
You don't deserve my fucking speech!
Oh yeah, that's it.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
What do you want from me?
Okay, I'm going, I'm going. Jesus...
So did you call people to tell them how to get to the studio tonight?
Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
My father seems to enjoy tearing things down more than putting things up. Seen the commerical? "Bringing every State to a Higher State."
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Same difference. Oh jesus, I'm gonna...
Like a suicide thing?
They used them on themselves to make it look like they were dead. Really quite a brilliant device, but too flamboyant to seriously produce.
Don't move! I'll get him back!
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
I don't get it! You were wrong! I was right! Strength, damnit! Come back!
I thought I...you..
Let's kick his ass.
Then get over on my side. Oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.
Where is he? Where's J.D.?
It rained everyday of my Maui vacation, but hey, I didn't kill myself. I'm Whitney James, Commentary.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
Thought I'd have a go at building the birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
steps back.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
He . . .
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Still hallucinating as well. Hmm...
It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open.
Your wife...?
Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore.
Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident...
I quit. Today's my last day.
Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there.
Someone special.
Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it.
I said she's been missing for-
As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this?
Nothing, look. Gwen I really like you-
For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you.
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
It's perfect.
For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
We're just gonna take some blood here.
Can you follow them?
Wow you are out of it.  
Use your mind for something other than numbers dear Trevor. Think about people for a change. People other than yourself. Like the women you slept with behind your wife's back. You were always so confident you had covered your tracks. Always confident your wife actually believed your fervent denials? Part of you must have known she would find out.
All you've got is the here and the now Trevor. That's all anyone really has. Maybe this will make things easier to understand. A man goes to sleep every night and has recurring dream that he's a butterfly. In time he begins to wonder if he might actually be a butterfly who dreams he's a man. And at the end of the day does it even matter? All these events you're describing. How can you be sure any of them really happened?
Shh. It's okay son. There is but one truth. One thing you can be absolutely sure of. And that thing is this:
YOU!
Well now there's a compliment.
WHAT?!
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
The bathroom!  For two days?
I... I'll do the best I can, Bernie.
I got your bail continued.
He gives a good report and I walk?
Some of it.  Right here.  I got some of it.  I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced.  My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
Mister LaPlante...
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
Bill, listen...
The same thing that always happens! You blew it! And this time you broke your son's heart instead of mine!  He was so proud, looking forward to going to a movie with his father... and you let him down!  Like you let everybody down, always!  What did you do, take a mudbath?
He's in bed!  You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand?  He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Me in my uniform.  Used to be on the bookcase.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
You're doing fine.  You didn't actually lift me though.  It was more like you supported me.
Bodybuilding!
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Apparently the guy who pulled you out wasn't a passenger...
If you reach out, you could get pulled over yourself.
Does this mean I can stop worrying? Where'd we put him?
Drake Hotel, Penthouse Suite.  Never stop worrying.  I figure we'll do a sidebar on what it's like to go from sleeping in your car and collecting cans to sleeping in the poshest suite in town.  Also Gale's onto something, digging into his background.
We paid him a million dollars. You'd think he'd want to cooperate a little, help our ratings.
Helluva story!
What?
I didn't ask him.
Call him back.  Ask him.  I'm a little...busy.
Nobody stole my credit cards.  They burned up in the crash.  Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Let's watch some TV.
Wife, girlfriend or mother?
And what about work?  Have you had any more thoughts about what you'd like to be doing now?
Right.  So, you have a new place, you've started working a bit -- I'm sure you'll be meeting some new people.
That would be monumentally stupid. All I'm saying is --
Who doesn't?
Sure.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
It's a living.
I was alone a lot as a child.  No one to compete with.  My parents ensured that I found happiness in the smallest things.  When you're all alone it's your own world, you don't have to take orders from anybody.  You don't necessarily believe the stories people tell you.
What happened?
Uh huh.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I've asked him what's wrong.
I could take a cab on the way home.
Whew.
He's staying with a friend.  Hurry up now, you'll be late for school.
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
What?
How was your lunch with Charlie?
There's no card or anything.
Neil's still having a bad time at school.  I feel terrible seeing him so upset all the time.
Honey, you know what I've been like lately... I've been a total zombie.  I have no idea what that was doing in my pocket.
Barbara <u>Zelman</u>?  I don't believe this!
Honey, I can't track of all the meals Charlie and I have been having.  This is a delicate time. If it leaks out that I'm jumping ship before I'm set up someplace else I could be out on my ear before I'm ready with nothing. With <u>nothing</u>.
Did you lock the garage door?
Did she water this plant?  It looks a little bent out of shape.
There might be some extras in the garage.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
No.
It's a double.
Thank you -- how efficient of you.
Promise.
If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
Well, technically it's not mid evil - - it's Renaissance.
A tape from the surveillance camera at the First National Bank.  It was robbed this morning.
We sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the State computers, the FBI and interpol. Nothing.
Interrogation's over, Bedsoe.
Cut him loose.  The D.A. says you ain't got shit on this guy.
No.
No.
You sure?
He doesn't look familiar -- but then he'd probably be easier to identity with his head.
Maybe he was a lousy shot.
Most people are afraid of death.
Hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
Caution shows wisdom.
Aye.
We too are brothers, Macleod.  In fact, you have more family than you think.
Can't you enjoy it quietly?
I hear you.
As friends -- always as friends.
If it came down to it what would you do?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
No -- I will.
I think you just like to eat dirt.
How?
Where do you go when your mind drifts?
Different places.
The past?
If it's good advice.
It probably wouldn't interest you. It's something I read in a mythology book.
Have you ever heard of the Calan?
--the Calan.  Do you know who they are?
Why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  They were wedged in tight.  They couldn't get a grip on them.  They would have had much more strength pushing on them.
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  Courage.
What's that next to him?
It's not been long enough.  What witchcraft is this?
It does not come off as easily as the young ones.
You cannot hide from me.  You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want.  Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want.  The world will be mine.
How can that be?
No -- I'm fine.  Thank you.
Why won't you ever let anyone help you?
Maybe Glen already picked up the disks.
You think we should take that chance?
I guess not.
I guess not, too.  How much information is in the house?
You won't die if you let me help.
But if you stay in this house, I can promise you this --
We got jobs, man; we're working.  Why even take the chance?
We're on foot.  We can't get away.
We're surrounded by houses, dumbass. Every house has a car in the garage. All we have to do is take one.
There is no way out.
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Fuck that.  They're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
Okay.
What do you mean?
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
You're hiding, Jeffrey.  You're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
I still see that boy's eyes.
I'm not gonna leave you!
Better than you getting killed!  Don't touch that gun!  Daddy says --
Do you want to go or not?  I'm offering you a way out of here.
What's that, Chief?  Say again.
Get everyone out here.  Then call the Sheriffs.  Tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
He didn't say.
Get a phone number for the Smiths.
I know the one.
What's wrong with the radio?
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Contact the landlord.  I want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
What's my name?
Those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  He <u>kills</u> people!
They've been in there all day.
Help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
They nailed the windows.  I can't get'm open.
Look for names.  Does it say whose taxes they are?
Who is it?
Follow the Mustang.  We won't go far.
I guess we do.
My people are good to go.  You know who I mean?
Cockroaches?
That's what I came to talk to you about.
Yes, it is a calamity for us all.
You work at the Hotel Diplomat?
There is nothing to it.
I don't have it here. At the Mille Collines. I can get it for you.
You want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for Captain Naramunju.
I ran out of bribes. Bizimungu took them away.
Will you protect us.
What did they say?
The American said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
The police are very busy.
I admire you, General. How do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
Please, General, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
Beer yes, but no whiskey.
Don't worry. I have a job this morning. I must go to visit my good friend George Rutagunda. You know George?
The fog is too heavy, sir.
I'm sorry, Mr. Daglish, this is the Mille Collines. No working girls here.
That will take time.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
I will see what I can do.
The third floor are low class rooms.
Pack the bags, we have to move.
Your brother's here?
Zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. Put these people in them.
It will do just fine.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
We have been abandoned.
You cannot go alone.
What?
I bribed the Minister of Health to have you transferred to Kigali.
What was the bribe?  What am I worth to you?
A Volkswagen.
A Volkswagen!
Paul! Then another voice.
Please do not talk like this.
Yes, Paul, I remember. The Mille Collines is a very important property for Sabena. Our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
Thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
Many times.
We have a big problem. The Hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
I don't know.
And what's Steven's status?
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
So what stopped her?
I don't know!!
-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
As a tumor.
I lied. The House is alive and we're all gonna die.
Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
There's always exceptions.
-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
Better living through electricity.
Wait a minute... What are you saying?
That's crazy!
It'll have to do.
All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Oh. You think this is a request. Well, think again. I'm telling you: "Haunted Hill" is exactly where we're having my party this year. You'll find the guest list on your desk by the time you get back --
Haven't they already?
Then who are they?
You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.
Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The "O.J." knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your "Jim Jones Kool- Aid" that was exactly that?
Sure it wasn't. Hey, anybody else here make their living with thrills'n'chills for the kiddies? Don't raise your hands all at once.
Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart.
I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine.
Maybe if I --
I remember...it was a long time ago...my father said: when the House was finally completed, make sure...we-christen-it- with-this-bottle-of-dirt-cheap-champagne- that-should-still-be-in a cupboard somewhere!
I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
-- confirming everything we already know --
I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just...
Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War.
He must've beaten us all here!
I can't comment until I get paid.
What's going on?
Why not?
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
-- ten.
You say you saw some activity here?
No!
It's origin is unknown.  The symbol does correspond  to a dagger I acquired many years ago.
By killing them?
I don't understand.
No it won't - no it won't!
We're going to go someplace new.
Daddy help!
Whatever you say.
There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  Who knows?  I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
Nothing's changed, has it. You still want to deceive me?
What are you talking about?
Oh, that's nice...
Why?
The blood of a woman is birth, life. It is part of the ceremony. Seamus offers up the pin - Maura waits a beat, then takes it -
Thank you.
I said nothing before, for fear you wouldn't believe me.  I've exorcised forces from this house. Eliza knew, she was there.  It wants another soul, the one we've taken away. We must weaken it!
Oh.
You'd lose the money-shots.  No.  I'll catch a bus.  Or a cab.  Don't worry about it.  Go.
And what did you discover?
Sorry.
No.  No, it's OK.  I ... It's my father.
Oh, right.  Did he used to ... ?
Oh, go on.  Have one.  Fuck it.  You think you're going to live forever?
Jeez, I've never owned anything.  I haven't even had a room of my own since I was fifteen years old.
No.  JP.  My last boyfriend?  He like owns the club.  You know?  You were there?  He bought the statue.
Would you know this store again?
No.  No, you don't understand.  We're not selling it.  It came from here.  We want ...
Fine.  Fine.  But can you tell us anything about it?
You gonna buy?
It's yours.  You won it.  It's a prize.
Oh come on.  There're lots of girls here who look better than ...
No.  Really?
I'm JP Monroe, you stupid little bitch. Now get the fuck out of my life.
You ... I can't fucking believe you, you bastard!  You get me in here ...
No.  I mean, really?  Because I'm concerned for you, sweetheart.  I care about you.  I guess I miss you.  I'm sorry we split up.  I'm sorry I ...
C'mon.  It'll be great.
Not now, no.  I mean - now that you're here, it's like she doesn't even exist, you know what I mean?
But you got three guards who... Shit, what am I doing?  Where's the want ads?  Gonna sell some spatulas.
No need.  Guards' station's right there.
Yes, master-thief, I can see that. You said something about a plan...
5:32.  "Swinging on a Star."
Alex, my man, it's time to play a little offense.  Where's your tux?
Okay.
Let's just forget it, I mean...
Ooh-kay...
You're supposed to be dead!
Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything?  What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?
Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade.  I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.
It's also been a long time for me.  I--
Somebody robbed the Vatican.
Wha--
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
Actually he never told us what it was.
Sure.  Face down.  Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man.  What did Little Eddie ever do to...
If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass.  But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
Because I didn't want to get hurt, taterhead.
Hey, guys, I've always wanted to sing like Franki Valli and the other seasons, but come on....
You want an address on that last one?
Remember that shoe you lost...
So when's that Sebastian-Cabot- Buckingham-Palace-looking- Butlerhead getting here?
If you think you're getting past me...
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Tonight?  You're whacked.  The timing's off, I'm underequipped Damnit, I have a date!
Employer?  The president?
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Why George, you big softie...
Tell me about it...
Sharp.
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Okay, Miss Archuh.  ...I got gears to see to.
Adenoids?
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
I myself --
Smitty.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
...Huh?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Never mind about that...
As a three-dollar bill.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
He grins wolfishly.
Yeah, but, buddy --
But, buddy, you were --
An example must be made!
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
But Buzz --
Mm. Well, say what you like about the man's ethics, he's a balls-to- the-wall businessman. Beat ya any way he can. Straight for the jugular. Very effective.
Yes sir...
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
Wait a minute!
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Hmmm.
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
Ya don't say.
Ten bucks says she's looking for a handout.
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
A puff-up, I call it.  But Miss Jessica always says "brioche."
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
Nonsense, child!  I know Wesley's been drinking too much lately.  I know a great deal more about what goes on at Fort Holland than you'd think.  I know all about you -- that you're a nice girl, competent and kind to Jessica.  The Fort needs a girl like you.  But now we've got to get you back there.  I'll walk you back and stay over night.  It'll be a nice change for me.
Try it -- you may have more influence than you think.
You've never said anything about voodoo before, Mrs. Rand.
Haven't I?  I suppose I take it for granted. It's just part of everyday life here.
You don't believe in it?
A missionary's widow?  It isn't very likely, is it?
I heard the servants talking about someone called Mama Rose. They said she had been "mindless"...
But how did you get here? What are you doing here?
You must, Betsy. They'll have to believe you.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
Yes -- on the boat.
Is she a doctor?
Ah, yes, our Paul, strong and silent and very sad -- quite the Byronic character. Perhaps I ought to cultivate it.
It's my day off.
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
A figure of St. Sebastian.
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
I'm afraid it's not very frightening.  They have their songs and dances and carry on and finally, as I understand it, one of the gods comes down and speaks through one of the people.
Why did you come in here?
I told you.
I hated her.
I have no defense.  So far as I know -- it is true.
Why?
You're wrong, Wesley.  The guilt is mine -- all of it.
Well, hey, isn't that a one-in-a million coincidence. A real dreamer, Jim Williams, eh?
Good night.
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Rough day. Good night.
I have no idea.
Am I unfaithful? Is that what you're trying to say?
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
All right.
Well it's good to see you -- we miss you around the house and all, but this St. Peter's, it's top of the line, eh?
Well, the whole gamut. Facts of life and all. Some fatherly advice, because, I tell you, there's things happening that you're probably old enough... well...  For example, on the self-abuse front -- now this is important - it's not advisable to do it in the shower -- it wastes water and electricity and because we all expect you to be doing it there in any case -- and, um, not onto the linen, and not on your sister's underwear or any clothing belonging to your mother --
Thanks.
Stay out of trouble.
In a bit.
Damn right, but where the hell were you?
If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed.
Oh for crying out loud Ben, you don't mean to tell me that your marriage is going down the drain now --
But I -- well maybe I love her. Elena.
Jesus, Benjamin, you're still as gullible as ever.
Sure is good shit. It's opiated. I had it in my chamber for a while. I was smoking this other --
Don't fret, Benjie, it's --
It was lovely!
Of course.
You're not a psycho!
I insist.  Don't touch them.
Thanks for eating it. I don't know why I even pretend I can cook.
I used to know how to cook.
How'd you know?
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
Reverend Edwards. Philip Edwards. You came by and checked out the congregation a couple of times last year.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
That I will indeed.
Where you going?
And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
Do what?
Howdy there. You, young knight. Can you check on the mead? Can you sally forth and secure us some more mead?
Yeah, Paul, are you gonna get home okay?
Let's see!
It's not packed with explosives, is it?
Good thinking Marge.
Who said so?
4:30 movie. When Worlds Collide.
Yeah. Yours?
You get in trouble?
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Watching what?
Greetings, Charles.
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
What time is it?
What are you doing?
Vodka?
I don't know. How do I know?
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Good.
Maybe you could drive him to Spencer's.
What's that, then?
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
It's only gonna make you crazy.
We already did.
The bartender at Darrow's.  He was there Friday night.
Right.  Got lost in the rocks.
Randy Stetz.  Her boyfriend.  We've questioned him, searched his place. Didn't find anything.
No.
I beeped you over two hours ago.
Seven years.
You don't have to be involved, Will.
You tell Buck and I'm involved whether I like it or not...
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Fuck you, man! - I'm sick of all your fucking cop questions...
That's a long time.
Who?
Thought you might find that.
Yes down at the station.
But you wanted to.
I gave her things she didn't have. Couldn't have.
There's nothing more to talk about.
You're not following procedure.
But the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
You fell too much. So much you make me feel...
She is.
How he must have loved you.
You let them do it.
You made me see their failings, Louis. You made me look at them with your eyes.
But you're the fairest by far.
What you are? You would be something other than you are?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Claudia - don't -
They are here. I know they are. Listen for something that doesn't make a sound.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Call him.
Yes...
The sun will destroy the blood I've given you. Every tissue, every vein. The fire in this lantern could do that too.
But you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
THEN YOU KILL HER!!!!!
Ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, I am like a mother tonight. I want a child.
You are the devil! You are the instrument of Satan!
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
We love it. I only wanted to prepare you.
No vampires in Transylvania? No Count Dracula?
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
Is that bad?
Built in 1948 for a member of the Rockefeller clan. The tile work was imported from Spain. A lot of history in these walls...Judy Garland stayed here...Hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
It's our version of winter.  201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy.
Stupid. What were you thinkng?
What are you doing in my closet?
Okay, I won't.
Yes.
What do we do?
No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one --
Oh...it's not working right. You're home early.  Did I scare you?
I told you.
To get out of Southport?
I said, this...Do you want a drink?
No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry.
They all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  Am I right, sister?
We gotta get out of here. Now.
I'm not hiding up no tree.  I'm with her. Let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
He's probably the only one who can help us.
I'm not waiting...So give me the gun and keep the ring.
You stumbled into my hiding place.
Hey -- shut up, okay?
Or even spirit messages from the next world.
All the more reason to watch him. He's had some wild notions lately.
We will know when the next one sickens.  Until then you and I remain here. I will not bring the plague to my troops.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
She has never mentioned her family.
What an odd question!
You've been playing on the superstitions of that poor old man — — working at him — — turning him against Thea.
I don't care who he is. He doesn't know.	He can't tell ——
No, I want more than that. I beg you General, make sure --drive a knife through my heart -- anything.
What is her illness?
I heard the same sound at Ladysmith, at Nukden, Port Arthur.  What do you expect after a battle?
I'll only go as far as the shore and wait for you.
It doesn't seem to bother you much, General.
You are my friend.
If I told you —— you wouldn't believe me -- but this much I can tell you —— the girl is dangerous to you. Take a friend's advice -- an old man' s advice -- leave her alone -—
I shall not leave the island ——
I'm hurrying.
I hate to do this, fella.
Well, who are you, then?
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
George Bailey.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
They went out of business years ago.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?
Joseph, now show him what happened today.
All in . . .
Please don't go away –– please!
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well, I've got eyes, haven't I? Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
Yes –– charge.
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
He's pretty young for that job.
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
Where are you going?
Huh?
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
It's important.
How do you do.
Right down here.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
Holy mackerel!
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
I see. I've suddenly become quite important. What kind of security would I have, George? Have you got any stocks?
Well, Dad's snapped up the idea. He's going to build a factory outside of Rochester. How do you like that?
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here –– from Tahiti –– Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Uh-huh.
Eighteen.
In that place?
Would you rather leave?
Please, let's not stop, George.
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
No problem, no problem.
Swim for it!
What the hell, we're steering for it.
You bet.  Hang on....
Over here!
It's still there!
Hendricks.  I want to go over your reports and your Form 908.
I missed you at the funeral home. Santos said you were here.
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
Sailing?
Do I have to?
Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
Stay here.  Don't go anywhere. Just stay here.
Maybe I don't make as much money as some bullshit rip-off artists around here, but I don't work the same way.
Okay, so that's it.
Sound.  Like sonar, or radar. They home in on irregular sounds, unusual sounds, any rhythmic low- frequency vibration.
So there's one around here.
In the den.
Because of today?  The beach?
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
Mike's out there.
Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
Two of them are still missing!
Martin, this is kind of an official meeting
What for?
Did he raise the Kids?
Did you say Cable Junction?
That's what he said.
1530 hours.  Might still be there. Base out.
Shouldn't he be at home?
Dad!  Dad!
Oh, yeah.  So why aren't they doing it now?
Waiting for Andy.
And second?
You got it.
Yep.  Looked like they were headed to the lighthouse.
Until we find something.
That's not it.  My dad told me not to go.
You do everything your parents tell you?
Anyone want to go the lighthouse?
Yeah.  Go on, beat it.
So it can't be done like that.  The man's a menace, plain and simple.
I have to walk him till the drug wears off.
With those camera lights and...
She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
Don't forget you have your brother.
See you later.
Don't let him get you.  Just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
Okay, bye.
And what else is bothering you?
We play hide and seek all the time.  They find a lot of things.
They just wanted to say hello.
And leave me down here???
What mind?  If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
Get some sleep.  And tell Sean I'm sorry.
It's my new perfume.  Great White, the Man-Eater.
I want to make sure the White is getting enough flow.  Would you do that for me?
Yes.  It's faster.
Well, that's why you got it.
You wanted to know about a cave?
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
But you --
I'm  fine.
Yes, aren't we all.
Make this quick!
No, no.  That won't do.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
Calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
And I like you.
The grenade's just to intimidate Whitey.  He knows I have it, so he watches out.  Same is true when I film lions, tigers, rhinos...
He.  She.  Let's blow the bitch up!
Sure.
He's missing.
Thanks.
Someone's looking for you.
How you doing, Kelly?
I'm a water-skier.
Why you sonuvabitch...
I'm not acting!  I don't want to go in it, okay?
SEAN!
Gotta sneeze.
Calvin said it was all right.
That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
I will, old boy, tomorrow.  Our work is done here.  Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
Yeah?  Well, in that case, have a drink.
The world's southern most reaches.
Damn!  You sonuvabitch!  Look at you!
Yeah, we'll find something for you.  Shoveling shark shit or something.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  Gang of kids were using slugs in the Pac-Man games.
Booked them all at Baskin- Robbins.
That's Dad...
I want to see Kathryn.
Sure.
He was doing his job....
We forgot to stop at the store.
We need milk....
Why should there be anything wrong? I'm sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
I used to worry...But you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
Can't help myself....
You're silly....
I didn't.
You're damn right I'm serious....
You could teach...You could....
Good.
You look tired....
I'm fine....
I don't want to talk about that.
There's a lot...I want to talk about it....
It was no accident....
When it killed Sean it was like a stab in the heart.  I knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. I knew that.  I know it's coming....
No one does till they learn....
You're doing fine.  I'll keep you out of trouble.  Relax....
One time I was flying supplies up the Amazon.  Went down in the jungle....
The plane's turning....
I'm terrific... Come on....
A big one....
I like to travel....
I own the airplane.  I can do whatever I want.  I'm the boss.
The world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
Tricky little devils, aren't they? How's the degree doing?
Oh, boy....
If we had some decent money, I'd be able to read their temperatures... Study their motor systems....
I stuck them on, man....
May your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
I know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
I've struck the mother-lode.  I'm counting... spade work....
I am...You must know something about him....
Close...I don't know...Just get the hell....
Maybe he only likes white meat....
Mom....
My equipment doesn't crap out....
In a few minutes....
No, my mother's .. You better stop in .. I'm just here to feed the cat.
The <u>dogs</u>?
What d'you mean, I just opened it for you? This is <u>French</u> champagne.
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Watch my lips .. <u>Don't get into it</u> ..
I don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, I mean <u>stop</u> .. I was exactly like you are .. I used to wake in the night - heart going so hard I coulda made love with my left tit .. If I can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
How'd you do it, old man?
Why don't you dump the "Fat Lady?"
No you don't. That's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. That's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. You won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
Thank Christ we got a witness.
No way .. not me, Mister. I'm not going up there again. Might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
So am I. But where's my money?
I never knew about the sailor the- ory, Ross. He might have that one little thing I need in his files?
You don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
Alright, enough, Ross. You'll bring on my "Nervous Tick" ...
I'm not in here to apologize, John. I told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "Good-bye, Princess," & the same night she gets attacked? That's a tough one to swallow, Bro?
Don't give me that! <u>Not another</u> <u>word</u>! When you had the Fat Lady in there, and I asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. So as far as I was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. And if the King of fucking England had walked in & told me different, I wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
We're not <u>here</u>. I don't want the desk to hear us ..
You ain't going in alone?
We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
My pleasure .. Who's Popeye?
What are you looking for?
Don't lie, Taylor. I just had this Blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
Hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
I'm afraid I can't give you an ans- wer to that, Mr Goodridge. As I ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
Well, apparently, she saw Amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
I'm Mr Berlin.  Mr Ross is right here. And Mr Ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's O.K.?  O.K. .. I'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with Amber on the aft- ernoon she left? Take your time, and nothing's too trivial, O.K.
I'm going back to the institute.
I know about alcohol, John.
Yes, Sir.
Two or three years ago.
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
No one's gonna make that Gent. Six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
He was waiting for you, Sir. Wait- ed a good while. Said he'd go down and take a look. I hope that's O.K.
His father's the manager, Sir. The kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
Seventy-two clients.  ONE stayed.  Jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
Look, I don't want a --
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Yeah, how'd it go with Sportboy?
Then you shouldn't have begged me to hire him.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Oh tsht. Yes.
Same to you.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
It's all going to work.
Yeah.  That too.  I broke up with Avery.
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Happy. He said "happy?"
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Good.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
I might call you later!
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package.  The kwan.
No, I'm saying to be --
It's a risk.
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Well, that ain't fair to her.  A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
Don't I know.  Now go home to your wife.
I'm asking you a question --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
Bobbi Fallon.  BPI.  I'm producing the Coke commercials for the playoffs.
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months.  Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  It's like --ka- boom.  The curse of 18 months.
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
You okay?
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
What'd I say?
Shut up!!!
What is it?
No, Dr. Grant says...
We have to help him.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
I do. It's worth another shot. And who knows? Things might turn out differently.
then we should...
Thirty-thousand, I think. Closer to the top.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Really?  What do you do there?
My favorite.
The first one. Before you where on the island. You liked dinosaurs back then.
Mine's new.
Then we go home?
No. Although I've studied them in the wild.
Sure you have. You wrote that book...
You.  Tell me, Roland, when was the last time you answered your phone?
It's the lawyers.  The lawyers are finally killing me.
They do have motives.  Why did you want to see me?  Your message said it was urgent.
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
Operations building.  Far end of the street.
You version of it.
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.
No way.
Where's Kelly?
Then the only thing left to do is make sure we do get back.  I'll call the mainland on the satellite phone and have them send the boat right now.  This expedition is over.
Very noble of you.  You don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?
Ian's a very good friend of mine.
I believe in him.
Move where?  Our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send --
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. If I understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
I ran a key check on every stroke Nedry entered today. It's all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
Pretty sure.
Oh my God.
But you can't think through this one.  You have to feel it.
John....
They smell.
The Cretaceous.
Sattler.
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
When people try to control things that it's out of their power - -
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
Yeah.
That'll - it'd be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  John's plan. 
I can't believe we invited Ian Malcolm.
People were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
Then they're expensive.  Put them back.
Donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  Everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
Brakes?  No.  No brakes.  They're electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
Listen, ahh - -
Really?
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
No.
So am I going to help you with your foot?
A Do-you-think-he-saurus Rex.
It's good protein.  Come on, Lex.  Why don't you touch it?  Look at his nose.
Nope.
Tim, I'm right here.  Easy catch.  Easy catch.  Count to Three..
Me?  Oh, hell yes.  Three.  I love 'em.  I love kids.  Anything at all can and does happen.
Kids get scared.
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
Wu?
What does he mean by "target audience"?
Shhh - - I'm right here, Lex.  I'm going to look after you.  I'm going to help your brother.  I want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
You're a beautiful big animal.
Okay.  Keep low.  Follow me.
Phone security systems, everything works.  You ask for it, we got it!
Thanks, Dad.
Ray, start the tour program.
Tell them when they get back to the cars.
We love the presents.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
I don't know!  I'm sorry!
That means they only eat vegetables.  But for you, I think they'd make an exception.
Jas... Jason Voorhees... he's here...
Compared to this guy... amateur.
Jason's. It came out of his chest... a hand with long blades on the fingers...
I think it's our best bet. They're taking apart his house right now... they found weapons, blood, a mountain of evidence. We can't say he was framed.
It's all right.  Now... we're going to need a really good head-doctor for this. Someone who can get up on the stand and tell the jury that our client is mentally insane and has been for years...  We'll go through a dozen doctors before we find one who's willing to testify for us.
One of the deputies is pretty cute. I think she likes me.
This sexual obsession of yours. Have you considered going into therapy yourself?
None of that's true?
No. You've told me all I need to know.
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
That's pretty weird. Is it possible for someone to not sleep for months?
Then I'd say it's bedtime for Jason.
That's right. The murders in the eighties were never solved.  But... there were teenaged witnesses who said Krueger had the ability to appear in your dreams... and that if he killed you in a dream, it would kill you in the real world.
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
You're not going to be there?
Think it'll do any good?
And if he's not?
A glorified office block.  They keep all the old records there -- the final resting place for facts and figures that have ceased to matter in the world of the living.
-- In magazines nobody reads.
-- In what sense?
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
A man must eat --  And drink.
What an extraordinary request!
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
You're just doing your job.
I do.
I've never seen you here before.
The police would know the difference, wouldn't they?
There are some people I'd like you to meet.  Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
I've heard of it happening.
Usually.
First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel.  If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
They're dead now.  We can get help.
Yes.  Yes, of course -- why wouldn't it be?
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
-- Accident and Compensation Association.
Well -- other departments are, yes.
We know that.
It's a farce.
I had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority I could see.  And I find you.  A body snatcher.
It usually is.
We used to be in the supply section, carrying boxes of medicine about but we dropped too many of them.
They'd drive us away.  That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
Jack!...  Jack!
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
And I appreciate that so much, I really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across America when they view my latest documentary sensation "Indonesia ...Hell Hole of the World". Ernie Hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. We're going out through Universal ... Laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
Native costume?
I can't get back to the wall! I'll get eaten!
Coz of something I lost.
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
Sure dear, yes.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Mm.
Well I'm certain Doctor Spangler will want to talk with you; excuse me.
A few more days. We know who did this.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Here please.
-- Yes.
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
Will you let me ask you some questions?
No, I'm look --
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
What?  What do you remember about that -- dumper?
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
How would I remember?
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
Is that what you gave him?
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
You said you wanted these.
Is there anything more I could --
I don't see anything, do you?
Try some other ways. 
Yeah, you got to me.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Thanks.
Don't worry.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
What am I supposed to say?
Don't touch anything.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
You're going back?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
I believed her, Pete.
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
What?
Just send me a money order.
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
I know Tom Grunemann.
Marital problems in general? Indicates possibly -- am I right Sergeant?
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And there's more every day man, there's more everyday.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
If we get anything from the lab, we'll have it by noon. And just think -- all he really had to do was write us a letter.
Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly -- we've appreciated the Sergeant's interest you know, all along. Here, locally. But New York, that's - well --
Very well, I'd like to see him if I may.
Detroit.
Greatest...
We use the green and yellow.
All it is is onions and gravy.
You are not allergic of onions.
You're no bargain either, pal.
Uh huh?
Good night.
See you in the morning light.
Uh huh...
Are you going to get remarried?
No.
What else wasn't there?
Because...Well, that's what he does.  He's a very powerful man.
Where will my bed be, where will I sleep?
Overruled.
Yes, your honor.
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?
Objection!
Yes...
Call up the people at J. Walter Thompson.  Set up an appointment at four.
Mis-ter Kramer, it's...  ...almost four now.  It's the Friday before Christmas.  Nobody is going to want to--
No.
More than three, less than thirty- three--permanently?
Do you have a lover now?
I...I don't know...
I took two thousand out of the savings account.  That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning.  They'll be ready on Saturday.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Yeah, well he did, didn't he.
She'll be back...
I don't know, Jim.  This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
Murray.
But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969--in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins.
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I've got a lot more than twenty minutes to kill.
You've got that look.  My lady and I split two years ago in August and I'm an old pro at this shit.  First thing, stay away from the Children's Zoo.  It's pure hell--if I never see another chicken, I'll be happy.  I'm here, darling.  Don't worry...
Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son?
Then you don't have a choice. Have Billy at the Seventy- Fifth Street entrance to Central Park, Saturday at ten.
Things? What kind of things?
I'm gonna keep him, why?
Got it.
Slow down...Slow down...
No.  I don't think so.
What d'you tell her?
I don't mean a little favor. mean a big F favor.
Uh, huh...
Where are you from?
Your people are very brave. They are fighting the Chinese. No one can stop them. Not even me.
Tell me.
And you have horses? You love horses.
Hmmm.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
All?
The United Nations voted not to hear our appeal.
If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
Me. First break of day.
Two.
Is that big?
He warned about the future of Tibet.
Tell me.
So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
India is a newly independent nation. They are struggling. India is in no position to help us.
And, America?
Of course, please, this way. Your servant may use the kitchen.
You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
Yes.
But, I have no experience.
I do.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Good. Where is Reting Rinpoche now?
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
Keystone what?
You're crawling around like a--
What I'm saying is <u>if</u> it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
I used to have this recurring nightmare that I was headless.
You don't want to cut me down. 'Cause I'll kill you.
I don't know!
'Cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
Can you confirm visually or just radar?
You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land.  You set?
You talk to Bickerman?
U.S. Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.
And what if I tranq him Kelly?  He drowns.  You think about that?
Scales were oval.  It was an <u>Asian</u> crocodile.
I'm no psychiatrist.  But I would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
Oh, bullshit.
No.
How would <u>you</u> know, what--
You don't like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
When you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
But why <u>Maine</u> and why alone?  Crocs are social, why's this guy on the move by himself?
Who taught you be be a nurse?
You think?
This is a little different.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
And you stock these things for what, to fend off Russia?
He said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
What is this?
Look ten feet into the water.
She's worried about the cow now.
Absolutely.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
It's ten after nine.
A tooth?
A tooth they say couldn't have come from any bear.  They say it looks prehistoric.  Like maybe a dinosaur.
Oh, well then I'm sure that's it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
Part of our research--
Well... he didn't have to tell me that part.
Kelly--
Shitbutt?
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries.
Sometimes.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
The market in Lecter hints is way down, today, okay? I've got two good men dead in Memphis, and three civilians. I've got -
Jack Gordon.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
He's a white male... Serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. And he's not a drifter - he's got his own house, somewhere. Not an apartment.
I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that?
Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
But if he knew we have so little time -
That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that -
Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now.
Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other.
Did you ever work with her?
We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified?
Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please.
Yes.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
His real name is Benjamin Raspail. A former patient of mine, whose romantic attachments ran to, shall we say, the exotic...? I didn't kill him, merely tucked him away. Very much as I found him, in that ridiculous car, in his own garage, after he's missed three appointments. You'd have him under "Missing Person" - which, in poor Raspail's case, could hardly be more true.
Wouldn't it have been easier to just leave him for the police to find?
Because you weren't wasting my time.
I don't know. Next time I'll have to check.
I've been in this room for eight years, Clarice. I know they will never, ever let me out while I'm alive. What I want is a view. I want a window where I can see a tree, or even water. I want to be in a federal institution, away from Chilton - and I want a view. I'll give good value for it. Crawford could do that for me, but he won't. You persuade him.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
They all were.
A moth... How did you predict that?
Clever girl. You're so close to the way you're going to catch him - do you realize that?
No. We just -
But what became of your lamb?  Clarice...?
Yes. I'll tell you.
Well, Clarice, have the lambs stopped screaming...?
You know I can't make that promise.
That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture.
I will not. I have seen the face of war before, Mr. Poe, but never war made on women and children. And almost as cruel is your indifference.
You knew them.
What?!
What would you have me do?
Yes. I want you to go.
He knew the consequences. And he stayed.  Are those the actions of a criminal?  ...Duncan, do something.
"Some"?
Yes. Yes, I will.
...Fort William Henry.
Do not let gratitude get in the way...
: Only one or two loads.
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
It does and it is a better lookin' reason than you, Jack Winthrop.  Push hard, 'cos you got to clear the French outpost by dawn.  Good luck, Jack.
And what is that?
Thank you. How can I reward you?
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
No. Stop in the glade just ahead! When the ladies are rested, we will proceed. Do you understand?
Yes.
Yes.
For Munro children?
How much gold has the master of the Yengeese?
The King? The King has mountains of gold!
This interview's over! The militia stays!
Magua slept hard in the English wigwams.  And the sticks left their mark...  Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English.  Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this.  In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron.  And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
I'm not a doctor.
And?
Yeah...right...
Uh, oh...I see where this is going...
That's an order!
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Less than an hour.  It's ruptured an air duct.
You're only twenty-five tons off quota.  Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  It's just a day off.  You don't have to take it, I just thought it might help.
What's your air reading?
Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact...I put your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last night...
Well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  Ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
It shouldn't be a long delay.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
How's TransOcean doing?
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
What was it?
Itches like hell.
Under there?
The infirmary?...
No fuckin' lie...
Sixpack...
How is he?
She's wondering what's happening.  We're losing air faster than I thought.
Probably no longer than four weeks.
I am not sure what's more worrying, the job or your past.
Jesus, Tom, do they work?
It's happening tomorrow morning. Get back here now.
No, I asked you to give me a refreshing drink. I wasn't expecting a fucking rainforest; you could fall in love with an orang-utan in that.
Like antiques.
You should see what they did to poor Gary.
Where're the others?
They were . . .
Better than good, he is a fucking liability.
Don't play innocent with me Bazza; spanking!
Jesus Christ!
Very fucking funny. Where's what I want?
All right, furry muff.
It is too late for you to start thinking John. It is a possibility and that is good enough for me. And after you strip the house, I want you to get every thieving slag this side of Ceylon and torture them, badly. I want to know who is responsible, otherwise I will hold you responsible.
And the weed?
Hit the fuckers.
Jesus, Soap, stop being such a mincer. I thought about that and...
He means they're thieving dogs.
Why, what's up?
Er, let me guess, my foot in your arse? A game of cards and Hatchet Harry. You're supposed to be getting some rest, boy!
Well, you're going to have a problem carrying on, aintcha.
I want your bar.
Doesn't sound very good to me.
Never mind that now. I also need some artillery, you know, a couple of sawn-off shotguns.
All right, let's forget about them for the time being. What about your weed man?
It's the mother of fuck-ups, stupid!
Nick the Greek.
--you're going to be on your own.
So?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
And you and Private Graves--
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Nice job.
Just wondering.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
No. You?
I never met her.
There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither.
Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all?
But they were Indians themselves.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
You wouldn't?
My father.
Cool.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Right.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
Seriously, I think we should get married.
If the next guy's a redneck.
Yeah. I bet he would.
Appreciate it, sir.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
Why would you want to do that?
No hay de que. Tengo otra. [No problem, I've got another.]
This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo?
I have some friends who have had a accident--
Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P--
'57, 1 believe--
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
We have a murder?
Buddy Deeds--
He agreed it wasn't exactly news--
Steve. Board of Education Steve who likes you? He goes for us hot-blooded Mexican girls, I can tell.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
Right. When he was killed.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
You ever play one of these?
Not if I can help it.
For a while.
It was for personal consumption.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
Most people did, yeah.
I came back 'cause you were here.
Yeah.
Two years.
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
White man just using you to keep the Black man down.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
Your mother wasn't one to get chased off her patch. Half the damn county knew and nobody thought the worse of her for seein' it through.
You know who it was?
I know that.
You going to tell him?
They go together.
I've heard a name.  Someone they talk about in whispers.
How?
You ever been married?
I love weird.
What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between --
That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew.
Why would I do that?
Death.
Why did you wait so long?
Did your husband know Quaid?
And you don't ask questions?
I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Forget the fee.  If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  If I don't...  ...my gamble.  Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
Why don't you tell me the truth?
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
It's okay.
...yes?
I... have... to.
Sure.
For now.  Are you planning to go back to New York?
So could you walk on water?
I heard he was the best.
Mine.
I saw him in Vegas once.
Why people die?  Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home.
When will she be in?
Shut up!
No.
Yes.
Don't bother.
Does anybody?
And what does Jennifer think's real?
Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading?
You've taken some strange journeys in your life.
Yes...
What?
No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course.  He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer.
Is that all?
And you believed him?
Looks that way.
You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour.
No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
Call me tomorrow.
Fuck you.
Not true.
Ok.
I'm thinking about it.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Yeah, look at that thing.
No.
Tomorrow.
Why can't it last?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Is this a bad time?
Like Japanese food.
Oh, come on.
Tomorrow.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Sure.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
Sushi.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
And on the day of the murders, his state of mind?
It's nothing.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
You should know I never felt Mr. Birdson needed anything but professional psychiatric care.  And then, minutes after they left, he suffered a stroke. He's comatose.  No brain wave activity at all.
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
He spoke to you?
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
Don't worry...about the transformation, Maya.
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
You just call?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
And also that...
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
What do you mean?
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
Trick him.
But I was baptized.  And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong.  I mean...this is ridiculous.  There's been a mistake.  I don't believe any of this.
Then why are you here?
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
I'm going to look around.
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Maybe that's my problem.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
So, what does it mean.  The ark sank and the sun set?
We need all the help we can get.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
Get out of here.
He can see you Thursday.
You watch.  One day, I'll hit the jackpot, get the big house, car, clothes.  I'll have more money than God.
Of course.
Really?  You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
Not what the records show.  Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
I can't eat before a game.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
I can manage.
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
But you use potato?
He's fine.
Okay?
It's okay.
Yes, we appreciate that.
Don't make fun of me when I'm being wonderful and supportive.  You belong on the court.  Just like I belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
This brother from my college.
They ever love you back?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
And what am I supposed to say to the man?
She hates all freshmen.
Just one word of advice for next season.
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Uh huh.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
Oh.
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
Please.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
None of your business.
I can't be nice to a fan?
So you're gonna act salty all night?
What are we playing for?
Plan to.
Why not?
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
Look, this party's whack.  You ready to go?
We're going to get some food.
Are you out of your mind?
Stay!
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
Thanks.
I forgot, "Q-man."
So...how's the knee?
You're serious.
Then why are you so upset?
Wrong.
What?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Said he'd be home later.
Quincy, please...
That's right.
Well, tell them to mind their damn business.  You're smart enough to get a degree.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party.  now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy.  Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
Still is, so let yourself out.
Came by to check on you.
Yeah.
No, no, no. I'm fine. It's small, I wanna keep going --
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
Ok. Janet you have Phil Parma --
It is.  Can I have your home phone number with area code?
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
There's no number for Frank in any of Earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- I mean, like I said, he's dying, y'know.  Dying of Cancer.
My mother had breast cancer.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
I don't wanna talk to you.
I'm not saying that, I'm sorry --
I have something, so much -- I'm sick, Claudia. I'm sick.
I'm coming!
No one else in there with you?
Ok.  Claudia Wilson: You tryin' to go deaf?
No.
Yeah.
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  Really. It's not.  He won't came back.
I don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Please, yes.
Yeah, You know it? You know Billingsley's?
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
-- what kind?
I don't know.
-- Richard.
Son, please, now....
It's ok, boy.
You wanna disrespect an officer of the law?
Doc, go get Frank and put him on the phone.
This sounds threatening.
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  Pit of your stomach. Like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
My name is Donnie Smith and I have lot's of love to give.
Picky, picky.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
That's right.  That's the first time you're right.  I CONFUSE THE TWO AND I DON'T CARE.
Gently, son --
Brad, I know you don't love me now --
I paid you back.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
I need to sit down.
There's no asshole like you.
How come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
-- it's not him. it's not him. He's the fuckin' asshole...Phil..c'mere...
It's ok.
Yeah.  You have the wrong number. There's no one named Frank here.
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
people die.
From '84 to '89.
Psychology major?
What name?  My name?
They wouldn't?
...are you Phil...?
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
Let's just wait one minute and stay here, okay?
Ok.
I work as a nurse, for a proffesion --
He's in here --?
...ok...
I don't think, he can't...
The door was open, I got a call --
I am calm.
You're not calm.  You're screamin' and yellin' and I'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what I'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
OK.  That's true.  Is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
Maybe so, but I'm gonna ask you one more time: Is Anyone Else In This House Right Now?
No I Said.
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
No.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and If I Have To Open That Closet you will get shot -- Step Out Now.
No.
It's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  I gotta stop. I gotta clean my brain of all the shit I've done that I shouldn't have done --
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
We're on the air in twenty minutes, Jimmy.
Find her, get her and tell her I want to talk to her, Mary.  Fucking hell.
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Come home soon after the show.
-- did she talk to you?
She went crazy.  She went crazy, Rose.
I don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
...I don't know...
I don't know what I've done.
Yes.  What's your name?
Not as much as I used to.  Ever since we started, I haven't really gone in to school that much because I've been getting more and more auditions --
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
You can't change his will.  Only Earl can change his will.
What kind of medication are you on right now, Linda that's --
Yeah.
Ok. One of those.  And...um...Barely Legal?
What do you do?
-- talk in the car, talk in the car, moves your ass, c'mon --
hang in there, ok. I love you.
Hi.
It's ok.
Yes.
God smiled upon us.
And you were not hurt?
If I don't kiss you, I die anyway.
We have much to discuss.  Tomorrow.
May I speak with you?  Alone?
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
He is nothing now.
Next week.  This is a mere garden party -- and I wish to join it, so I will be brief.  I am experiencing resistance from the Jesuits.
I have demanded it -- and common priests present themselves!  Can you imagine the arrogance?  Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.
If I find out the identity of this Jesuit rebel.  I will kill both him and the man who told me.
How goes that favor I asked of you?
Well here is the problem at hand: the King has ordered me to discover the identity of the Governor General of Jesuits, and kill him.  As our English rivals have left the Catholic Church, Louis has struck on a plan to dominate the whole of Europe by uniting Church and State and making himself head of both.  He has already picked the Pope.  Only the Jesuits, who put God above throne or papacy, stand in his way.
He who is not with us is against us.
Those are the words of a broken spirit.  My spirit is whole.  I have trusted d'Artagnan with my deepest secrets, and I will never believe he is my enemy.
More wine!!
But -- what is Porthos doing?
About to hang himself, I should think.
We must stop him!
Hold your goblet with two fingers.
Still you serve him loyally -- though people hurl rotten eggs at his royal emblem.
You can't do it.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
I just said you're praying!  Are you deaf too?  I know you're blind, because if you had seen the tits that just walked out of here, you'd have tears in your eyes.
Jesus of Nazareth found the holy among the profane.  If we are to have a place of private prayer, where better than here, beside the channels where the shit and the garbage run to the river?
A tomb?  We're in a tomb?
Easy to say, but hard to do.  For what I am trying to tell you is that I am the Governor General of Jesuits in France.
But I was on duty...
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
What use am I?
Did she have tits like that?
The Queen Mother.  Anne.
So what?  I'd rather die covered in blood, than an old man, lying in my own piss.
Michelle, she -- The king has invited her to come live in the palace.
You can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
Oh my friend.
Why do you follow him, d'Artagnan?! I know you have put service above your own life, but why does this King deserve such loyalty?  He is a monster!  He executes ministers for his own blunders, with their families hostage so they take the blame!  He has no honor!
It is something I have done -- or did not do.
What is that?
I decided it this morning.
A personal nature?
Silence!  I order you!
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
You will protect me as you always have, d'Artagnan.
I am unhurt --
What number, on the first page?
Athos, the former Musketeer, has just fought with several of your guard, at the Musketeers' Gate.
Wait, no!  Do not be ashamed.  The straits of your family need not be permanent.  It is a simple matter to have them brought to one of my country estates, where they may have fine meals, and physicians to look after them.
Yeah - I heard - nothing came up.
If what you're saying is true, then why would he have killed two police officers? A man like that would want to lay low, if he was planning some kind of damn sabotage mission!
If you guys want in, fine.  Just remember this is our jurisdiction.
I'm sure you can handle it.  Now I want to do an alley-to alley sweep beginning at the north and south ends from Marine to 30th.  Foot beat units continue on the boardwalk.
Yeah...
It wasn't in the cards.
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Alright, alright!  We were just fucking with him..you know?
What?  Wait a minute -
Well let's get his ass to the garage!  Some lead...
No.
Didn't these - professionals - figure he had a girl in the room?
Found what?
Yeah.
Shit, you know what happens to me if I'm harboring a fugitive?  I already think they're on to me! I thought you were the phone police for Chrissake!
Let's see what we got...
I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
A bank?
Both at the same bank...
I'm going to need a way to get there.
You must be going somewhere.
Well, you saved me from a bad situation. Thanks.  I admit this is...unusual.
We were fighting - I told him to let me out.  So where are you headed?
What?
Where is he?
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
He doesn't have anything to cut with.
You wouldn't like it, either if you had it.
How much do you know?
Get him to Atlanta.
He is good. Bur not as good as Price.
What do you want to do?
Don't expect too much from me, Jack, all right?  We'll get him one way or the other.
What's one way?
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
What is it?
It's your call, Will. What do we do?
We will feel sick for a very long time.
What'd it say?
It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all.  It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
There's no connection between the families.
We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in.  They're in the far corner of the room under the windows.
This is our boy...!
How far away's the back-up?
Stay in the trees.
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
Put your back against the door. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
Dandridge is a condescending prick. Ride with me. It would be because I want you to.
Uh-huh.
I'll get it.  Stay right here. You look very good in the sun...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
Was I in an accident?
I'm very scared.
Mr. Lounds, you're a reporter.  You're here to titillate your readers. If you don't open your eyes, I'll staple your eyelids to your forehead.
Are you a man?
How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
3680 DeSoto Highway. Marathon, Florida.
No. I can help you.
Why do you think I called?
Cut the general crap.
Goodbye.
Mrs. Leeds was a good-looking woman. I'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?
That's all we know about.  Most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. A suck mark. These don't. So, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  You could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. I know that's pretty thin...  He bites a lot.
I understand he cut you pretty good...
I don't know. I'm goin' up to Baltimore this afternoon.
No.
Is Crawford going with you?
I want to see you, too.
You going back down to Florida after?
Go on to the house...
Yes. Who are you?
Oh, Jesus... Come in.  Honey...!
In this hatchery? Forty to fifty.
We don't know that.
Hobbs was insane. He was attacking college girls and he killed them.
There are things you don't have. Research materials... I could speak to the Chief of Staff...?
You'll get to see the file on this case. And there's another reason.
Pray tell.
You're insane.
Do you know how you caught me, Will?
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
Yes.
So I understand you're from Lithuania?
HANG ON, you ain't heard the best part!  ABC has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "Latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
LISTEN, you arrogant putz!  I've been in this business for twenty years!  I know!  If you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, NEVER see another one like it again!!!!
That's alright.  Where...?
Oh, you know the Bay Area!  Always foggy!
WRONG!  You haven't given them any clues that it's a parody!
Andy... it's me.  I've got some crummy news.  Taxi's been canceled.
That's ridiculous.  You don't even smoke.
You've got good days and bad days.
Ehhh, you know those guys.  If he had his way, I'd be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  And anyway, I've found a new guy who's gonna be able to instantly remove the cancer.
Really?
I don't swear.  I -- I don't do what everyone else does!
Andy!
Oh!
Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing.  It didn't hurt at all.  It was just a yoga move.  I tucked my head in.
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
If you want...
Andy... there is no real you.
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
I said I didn't want to do the sketch.
DON'T TOUCH ME!
It's so dirty.
It's working for Elvis.
Why??  I... I attend every year.
No, I'm serious.  If you book Tony, do NOT EXPECT TO GET ANDY.
I GOT A CONTRACT!!  I'm gonna take you to the DEPARTMENT OF LABOR!
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Where?
Oh shit.
What?
You killed them.
No!
Midnight watch.
What happened to them?
I got you.
Yes.
There's a small ledge.  It's a short climb.  You can make it.
There are only two ways out of this building.  One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody.  You take a chance either way.  I leave it to you.
You're the One, Neo.  You see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I've spent most of my life looking for you.
What truth?
Be what?  Be real?
Wild, isn't it?
What did she tell you?
What do I believe it?  Are you kidding me?  What do you think?  I'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything I believed was real, wasn't.  The whole world, my entire life was a lie.  I don't know anything anymore, Morpheus.
Why?  So I can hear some old lady tell me, what?  That I'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? The one that's supposed to save the world?  Come on.  How do I respond to that?  I can't.  It's ridiculous. I mean who am I?  I'm nobody, I'm just a guy.  What did I do, Morpheus?  Why me?
And you still believe I'm the One?
Morpheus, I don't know --
Got one ready, sir.  Subway.  State and Balbo.
I know.  You're Neo.  Be right with you.
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
What vase?
I'm not the One.
Sorry, kid.  You got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
That was a long time ago.
Of what?
It's necessary, Neo.  For our protection.
From what?
Is it?
Are you worried?
She told me...
I don't know.  It just went dead.
I'm sorry, I'm not.  I'm just another guy.  Morpheus is the one that matters.
I believe I can bring him back.
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
You will tonight.  I guarantee it. I'm Tank.  I'll be your operator.
If this war ended tomorrow, Zion is where the party would be.
They inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  It's like cracking a computer.  All it takes is time.
Neo, this has to be done!
So did we.  I sent him to Franklin and Erie.
Let go of her.
Yeah, yeah, never mind.  You gotta be careful.
Nobody sees where I get the stuff. That's good business.  I'll be back in thirty minutes.
Be careful.
So?
Yeah, I'm gonna worry about you, too.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
C'mon Tony, waddaya say?
Should I slap him?
What about your attitude...Where's your job...eh?  You talk and talk and I go to work...what do you do?
I'll tell you what I don't do... I don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  Show up or I break both your arms, we understand each other?
Don't promise...just deliver.
No you're not...
Come on.
I'll be here.  Don't worry.
No.
What pipes?
Ok...that's it.
You said it.
Fine.
No...no stripping...as the hostess.
Yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... Listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
...The one who's sick, right?  In the head.
Nothing.
Wha?
Don't ask.
Take your time.  I don't care.
Ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
But...
This is some boat.  Your father's?
Can you spare it?
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Hi, Allison --
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Honey --!
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
It's going to be great --
Me, too.
You have a way with words.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Before I do --  I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Please, Drew.
What are their feelings?
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Are you running this Board or am I?
Never mind Bontecou.  I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
'It's up to Joe'?  Those were his words?
Well, that's very interesting.
You're on, Quin-cee.  Destination Hospital.  Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide.  Okay?  How's that sound to you?
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
'It's up to Joe'?
No, no.  I on holiday.
Some spot you pick.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
Of course, Mr. Parrish.  Right away.
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
Oh yes, I do.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish?  I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you.  Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place.  He was setting up Bill from day one.  Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside.  And I was the fool who made it all happen.  Oh God, what do I do?
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
I am Joe.
Be sorry for nothing.
Well, now I am sorry.  For intruding on you this afternoon.
Yes...I've found that it does.
I'm sorry to hear that.
To bed.
Yes.  I'm tired.
It was everything.
Faster.  And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
I loved it.
More than you love peanut butter?
Hold me --
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
'Threw' you?  Where?
Your doctor?  Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta?  Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain?  Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
Good night to you, Bill.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
That's what everybody says.
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.  A little Coleman's mustard.
Absolutely.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Okay.
Goodnight.
'Spooning'?
This universe?
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
I love her, Bill.  She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
Then what is it?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them.  And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Those were my words, Bill.
And we're very grateful.
What the hell are you talking about?
How're you doing--?
The vodka.  What'd I tell you?
Does Drew tell you everything?
You're only six-five once.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Probably.
Well, it worries me.  I want you to get swept away.  I want you to levitate.  I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Yer damn right.
We've met.
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
Nothing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
It's something.
Joe?
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I don't care if you love him!  I'm telling you he's no good for you!
I want you to know how much I love you.  That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something.  I don't want you to ever worry about me.  If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.  -- And I have no regrets.
I could be her.
I know what you're saying.  Doesn't pay very well.  Depends on the woman I marry.  Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
I think I know her.
That's it.
Burt.
Couple days.
Then why is this my handwriting?
Thanks.
Don't say anything else.
You told me.
Kill him.
There are things you know for sure.
Your wife?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a			* lot of people.
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
No!
What's this all about?
What?
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
I'm not appealing the decision.
Then why are you here?
She seemed to leave happy. I thought I'd helped her.
Yeah, but the pleasure of a book is in wanting to know what happens next -
You're in a playful mood.
I'll be waiting.							   *
Why?
No! Should I?
I might have fallen asleep before I did.
I don't know.
Sammy. Remember Sammy. You told me about Sammy.
Because she'll have taken one look at your clothes and your car and started thinking of ways to turn the situation to her advantage. She's already got you staying with her, for fuck's sake. 
She's involved with these drug dealers.
How long do you think you can hang around here before people start asking questions?
Why? Come on, Leonard, we talked about this. It's not safe f or you to be walking around like this.
Why not?
How do you know this?
'Cos he fucking told me. He thinks it's funny. He's laughing at you.
No. Don't worry, I'm a cop. Everything'll be okay. Is he still breathing?
I never said he was faking! I never said that!
Yes, I will.
When it's done, I'll know! It'll be different!
I'm not. I was the cop assigned to your			* wife's death. I believed you, I thought			* you deserved the chance for revenge. I helped you find the other guy who was in your bathroom that night. The guy who cracked your skull and fucked your wife.		    * We found him and you killed him.				  *   MEMENTO - Green Revisions 10-4-99 115A.

He any good?
What do you think?
I got to talk to my ADO...
I got the item.
Okay.  Macon, Georgia is where I was born. Wound up in a juvenile facility.  I was 14.  Then the military.  Then prison.  Because I was dumb and angry.  Then I read.  Then I got smart.  Then I discovered what I know, now...it's all business...
To mothers.  And all that we owe them...
That's right.
Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers.
Good samba dancing...?
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Really?
Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
Stevens?
What kind of weight?
Verdado.
Verdado where?
So we want to change-up the mission statement.
Call the US Coast Guard:  "Come and arrest our ass."  And Switek resumes romancing Miss Ukraine...
You're giving away your money, fool...
How do I discuss operations over an open line?
And the deal goes down at another place at another time.
That's right.
How do we do that?  Make a buy?  That went well...
Have faith.
Where's Riccardo?
We think NLR.  We don't know! Alonzo only fronted as a broker for our guys to make the meet.  He wasn't deep into the crew.
He's talking to you, bro.  What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization...
Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do...
Yes.  What's up?
Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you?
Good idea.  We'll grab a bite.
...even if they could run the identities you built to EPIC, all they'll find is more cover... Trust what you built.  It's quality, girl.  We're cool...
Precursor shipments from Ras Tanura and Ju'aymah?
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
<u>You</u> give <u>yours</u> to me.  <u>We</u> position all the assets hauling our loads...
What...?
I'm sorry. I thought you were -- never mind -- I've never actually been there, but let me see, you take the Seventh Avenue subway, I think, to the end of the line...
No, ma'am, I'm not.
Yeah, oh yeah.
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
I show you what problem --
It's sticky. What you do, slobber on 'em? I wouldn't touch 'em.
And end up a hunchback like my old man? You think I'm crippled? You shoulda caught him the end of a day.
What I'm gonna do, I'm gonna make a cowboy outta you, kid. How about that? Build you up a little, teach you couple little tricks'n turn y'out to stud, Rat-stuff.
Well, I don't think I can walk.  I mean, I been falling down a lot and, uh...
Sounds like crap, admit it. And I'm not gonna have it. I'm Rico all the time, okay, do you blame me? That's agreed, okay? We're gonna tell all these new people my name's Rico?
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Don't make me laugh.
Nah, just covered with batshit!
They went out over there: must be some kind of exit.
Sixty?
Not far. Just a little way.
Be tough on 'em.
I don' t know. It's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. A big door...a wheel....
Jimmy?
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Cat, ah!  Ayip!
Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
Mr. Yesil.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
There's some weird shit here.
No, you talkin' at me.
The kid's with them!!
Go!! Just go!!
I pull.
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
You did!
No, there's...
No such thing, baby.
You said that thing was big as your hand.  I don't think I'm going to miss...
Try not to sweat?
That's it?
Just like Trump Tower, then.
No shit.
Thank you.
It's right this way.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear--
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Pretty rough so far.
The phones are working?
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself.
My pleasure.
I'm getting to believe you.
I'm...
I DON'T WANT HER SPIRIT! I want HER! And you MURDERED her!
Yes.
Great.
You--fooler...!  Did I do good?
C'mere, I'll show you.
Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you.
That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays...
Not even a hint?
It is.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things.
That thing.  Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be.
I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels?
Maybe you can, Libby.
Answer me a couple things?
Hugh, take care of the Nekhorvich memory card.
What made you pick <i>that</i> nag?  She'd never won a bloody thing.
What else?
To do what?
I would've thought the hardest part was exercising restraint.  Curbing that pressing need of your to get your gun off.  You were in such a hurry to knock off that 747, you never figured out where the virus really was.
What was the top bid?
Which means, Mr. McCloy, we have to get our hands on four hundred and eighty thousand options.  We'll borrow your thirty million to buy those options.  Your stock's never sold above thirty-one dollars a share.  We'll agree to buy at fifty.
It's okay.  She scrambled the transmission.  Luther, continue feeding the GPS her position.
..or hard wired..
Then we got'em!
I'm not ready!
And the check's in the mall.
Five and a half minutes.  He's breached the hot zone..
Oh, either way works for me.
Hey, you put me here.  I just do what I'm told.
Where did you get this number?  I don't even have it!
They've got a book for everything.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
Of what?
Five, six-hundred thousand.
Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical.
Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself..
Ethan, you take care of yourself, I'll take care of myself because if push comes to shove, I'm gonna bail - and without giving two week notice.
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Affirmative.
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
I'm infected with Chimera.  You know you don't have a choice.  Just do it now.
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
You gotta be kidding.
Like?
You were there.
Enough to kill Nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?
Yes, I believe that's right.
Yes, I believe that's right.  Now my understanding is that 20 hours after exposure, the victim becomes infectious. Highly infectious.
She sacrificed herself..
No.  I can't afford to be curious.  And neither can you, Hunt..
By fire.  That's the best way, really.
Sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.
Yes, he knew.  Just..
You keep calling me Dmitri.  You really shouldn't.
Confirm.  Left jacket pocket.
Oh. Uh. Commencing diversion.  Alarm in cosmetics.
Copy.  She's only got twenty-eight minutes left.  Track ahead and pick her up.
Do I?
I don't remember what happened!  We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
Same thing he wanted in Prague!  Same thing he's always wanted!  The NOC list!
But why tell us?
Course he did.  Just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  Before or after I showed in London, mind telling me, Ethan?
Stay out of this. OR Lachez - moi OR T'agueue
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I've been disavowed.  They think I killed Jim and everyone else.  Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.
Ethan, you're not making sense. Let me go in and talk to Kittridge. I'm going to tell him you had nothing to do...
Claire, Claire, Claire, if you're not dead, he's going to assume you're with me.
Jim was my husband. I want to know who killed him.  I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
You are my eyes.  Stay with him.
<u>Are you intact</u>?
We've lost enough agents for one night.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
What kind?
It's hard to tell.  I'm gonna have to be close.
I need one hundred thousand dollars.
I don't know Job any more than he knows me.
Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you're gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
What was your deal with Job?
Uh -- twenty-one, but there's no alarm in sector twenty-one.
Let's move!
Time up.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
I'd say you've got about two minutes.
Isn't he chairing the Armed Services hearing?
If you were me, Ethan, who would <u>you</u> trust to make him believable?
Can you lose him?
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to Paris.
No, in your...ear piece. You have a lovely smile . Can you hear me now?
I don't know.
Why don't you take a look?
Too wicked to have a drink later?
And a lonely ass.
I know, I am so sorry for so many things. I love you, Moira. I love you. I love you.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I don't know what you mean.
He got hit by a bus.
In a month.
I won't come.
Yeah.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
It's temporary.
I got it done.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
You think so, huh, Stupid? Those dogs love each other.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
You don't have to help me.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
No!
Where are you taking me?
I've got you.
That light.
Take it easy.
What did you do?
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Thank you.
Kinda gaudy.
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
What!
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
Seven-thirty.
Then let's set the date.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
A month from today?
How was your plane ride?
Loretta, I can't marry you.
WHAT?
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Did he tell her?
Are you drunk?
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
That's a pretty big sin.
I know.
Maybe. I don't know. He has not asked my advice. If he asks my advice, I don't know what I will say.
If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
Talk to him.
Come on in.
Yes.
You're kidding?
Yes.
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
Have you come to make peace with me?
Of course I want to.
But absolutely!
Don't shit where you eat.
I guess you can't invite me in?
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
I'm a little cold.
I'm too old for you.
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do?
Look.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner.  Is he down there? No.
What would he be doing down there?
Tell me ...  what do you do with witches?
I am...  And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot..  I must speak with your lord and master.
You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
Well, this is a temperate zone.
And ... the Grail ... The Grail is there?
The Britons.
No one live there.
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
You must return here with a shrubbery or else ...  you shall not pass through this wood alive!
What, "is"?
'Tis but a scratch.
Come on then.
I am King Arthur and these are the Knights of the Round Table.  Whose castle is this?
Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. He's already got one, you see?
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Ni, ni, ni!
|      It's not working. You're not doing it properly.  Ni!
That is our quest.  You know much that is hidden O Tim.
There he is!
I'm thirty-seven.
I mean, if I went around saying I was an Emperor because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, people would put me away!
And the hat.  But she is a witch.
I'm getting better!
Do me a favour.
What is your favorite colour?
Right.  Off you go.
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
I can't take him.
That's all right.  See you on Thursday.
I dunno, Must be a king.
Why?
I think I could pull through, sir.
Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
Is it?
Father, lad.
Well ... I'll tell you ...
If we ... er ... 
We're coming with you.
I don't think I was.
When danger reared its ugly head, He bravely turned his tail and fled Yes, Brave Sir Robin turned about And gallantly he chickened out Bravely taking to his feet He beat a very brave retreat Bravest of the brave Sir Robin Petrified of being dead Soiled his pants then brave Sir Robin Turned away and fled.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
She'll be worried about me.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you.
She means it.
Mary Taylor, sir.
The future King!
It's so infernally cold in here.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Mama...
We --
I need a man who knows where I am.
That's not good enough.
Yes.  I do.
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it.  You know that very well.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
Oh.
I said.  I serve the Queen.
I am.
I'm glad of it.
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
I ordered it.  It's for your own safety.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
Excellent!
No, indeed.
I understand he was in a fight.
Well...it involves a paradox.  You have to trick The Boatman.  Now all the while, you also have to watch your strength.  You can build that back up by catching FIREFLIES...the little glowing guys...
Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.
He?
And maybe you've been taking too many drugs.
Why don't we take this into my office.
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
How?!  It's a machine, Alex. Machine's don't think.  They're not alive.  It's a good program, a brilliant program, it was designed so it would act as if it were alive, but it's not alive.
All of them?
We can't...
Give me a break, Alex.  What are we going to tell them?  Excuse me, officer, but there's some sort of electronic monster loose in the phone lines.  I'd think twice about calling any of those 976 numbers...
I know how to do this!  I'm good at these games.  You never play, you'd be nailed in an instant.
I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you.
Yeah, well I figure these are unusual circumstances.
Look around...
I just thought of something.  If we came back from the game...  ...what if ARCADE did too?
I'm okay.
The game will guide you.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
What did you say?
And?
The Cowboy??
Will you meet with him?
There is no problem.
Okay, I'm thinking.
One.
You're an understandin' fella.
Okay.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Good luck, honey!
Yeah ... Betty. You don't rush it. I don't rush it. We play it close, just like in the movies.
But you won't.
Yes, there was.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that.  I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
I think I've been hurt.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Do you know them?!
The one of 'em still alive?
Oh yeah.
Find out who they are?
Making ends meet, huh.
It was just a thing. The story made you laugh.
Sure, reach in my shirt pocket there.
No time. Get him up.
Maybe not, but he is and fucking him makes you an accessory. He stole your passwords.
So what do we do ?
I'm working on it.
It's called Murderland. It's paid for by First Bank.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Okay.
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
Who are you anyway ? What the hell is this ?
Because of my charming personality ?
Not quite....
Why ?
Ow...
What ? Are you my mother ?
Not yet.
I just want to double check the facts.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
Zach my boy, I can spend your yearly salary in a blink. I have had that kind of money all of my life. If I wanted to, I could fly to Paris for the afternoon.  My father formed this company over seventy years ago. When my brother became mentally challenged, it was put in my charge. Now running a bank of this size is very stressful. I need to relax on what little down time I have. A yacht club will not quite make my blood pressure decline. Understand ?
Son, let's watch the tape.
Yes sir. It turns out we put an innocent man into the "park" and he was not the one who stole from the stamp machine. That is also about the time when Bruce began refusing.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
That my boy, is the best part. Life on top of the world is boring... predictable. If I wanted life without chances, I never would have paid for Murderland. Now go. Make a formal proposal and see about the assistant. Find out if it's viable.
Have that tape on my desk tomorrow morning.  First.... thing...
I'm just looking for our best interests. May I have the tapes, Bruce ?
I'll see that bet.
What happened ?
Thank you.
Yes.
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
I just want to have something that's mine, you know ? It's like living off of their money is fun and all. There are certain materialistic needs that I have that can only be satisfied with that extra little scratch.
Nothing.
Why don't you shut up now.
Did you see what the First Bank stock opened at ? Very impressive.
Were you involved in the incident where that guy killed himself in his office ?  I am sorry. Perhaps we should have dinner tonight to.... discuss your future.
I was drinking a little in those days.  I'm drinking a little these days too.
Everyone was really surprised when Maggie was turned in, she got kicked out for two weeks.
Could you hold on for a second? 
Okay thanks, atta girl.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
What??
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Oh honey, back then...people did crazy things.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
You are?
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
oh.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
Oh God, he's coming over here, act natural, totally natural.
Boys always pretend they hate you when they really like you.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
I guess you have.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
TAXI!!!
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
What, you think the guy should change his name?
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
And I thought I was weird.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Oh no?!?!?!
And you'd be my cousin?
He's an undertaker.
I'd consider it a personal favor.
Was Rose.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Is that a yes?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
You couldn't?
Well I'm sort of involved.
Oh, sure okay.
Is there milk in them already?
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
It would be fantastic.
Hey! Oh look.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
I like to buy off all the railroads.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
What?
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
It's nice.
What happened to her?
It's only eight o'clock.
I'll second that.
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
Perfect.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Any more soda left?
I love this guy! 
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Can I go too?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
What are you doing.
In the garage.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
Will you tell her I came by?
Thirty five dollars.
Why?
My ball, I lost my ball.
Come on sweetie.
Come here, sit down.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
I'm hemorrhaging.
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
You could pick that scab on your arm.
It'll bleed.
What's wrong with your eyes?
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What?
You're right, let's knock it down.
Hurry!!!
I don't like her.
No, I'm hiding out.
Okay, seeya.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Gold nose hair clippers.
I love him.
That's entirely understandable.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Mirrors.
She's too genuine.
Endearingly absent-minded.
She finds him "personable."
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
You keep saying that.
Have you.
Shhh.
DON'T SPEAK!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
To him.
Well, if that's the way you f...
... Mr. Julianne Potter, prominent New York drag queen.
Right here.
Okay by me - I'd sure like to see that Opryland.
I hate that music.
Green.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You remember what I said about the Vitamins.
You bet.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
His word? Are you telling me Haven promised you something?
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
A little slow, but she'll be fine.
Have you talked to Triplette?
Where the hell have you been?
Yes. Percy Warner Park'.
What crook?
Let me know when you do, all right?
Some guy was drunk and hit him. Accident. Haven almost killed him.
Sure he will.
Hi, Sherry.
I'1l get your bag.
I said, maybe I'll change my name again.
We don't mess with accessories.
What kind?
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
Oh... Well.
I don't think so.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
Well, I met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
What?
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
I can't remember. In out/out in, something like that. Around eight.
Thirty?
That's what you said before.
How much?
For him?
Yes.
Sleeping.
Do you study at all?
You go to school together?
You know, I'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
You always live there?
I know a couple.
Who?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
Wade -- I've been working toward this audition for years.
I see.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Yes, you are.
You got something you want to do?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
You've heard of it?
Oh my God!  Sorry.
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
Yes, sir.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
Wagons, hooaaa!
Yes.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
She sings? What does she sing?
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Do you miss Mallory?
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory.  What's up here?  What's in here?
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says the United States of America.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Yeah, we have a van.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview.  We did an interview, didn't we?
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
Have you seen 'Pumping Iron?'
He had the edge. The mind's edge.
They've hypnotized the nation.
Just for fun, I guess.
Mickey stops sawin' on my leg and says, 'Oh my God, I'm your biggest fan!'
Apparently, they've seen all our films.
I hear ya. Play.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
What's the big deal? Take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut---
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
How 'bout Mallory?
Yeah, sure.
They passed the 'edge' along to us.
Never is a very long time, Wayne. A word only the weak use. I'm not a sore loser. Even if I don't have a leg to stand on, I'm going to get up and fight this world until I'm on top again.
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Ya know, I was.
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
They done that too long in my family.
Want me to come?
See Duff. He's the money man.
You think so, Frankie?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Used to be. On the railroad.
So it wasn't funny, huh? Well, I thought it was. What d'you say, Barney? Wasn't it funny?!
'Bout time you showed. Door's open.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
Okay.
Name's Duff.
Don't say much, do you?
Guess so.
No. What you usually say, I guess.
Where was your father born?
And his age?
Well, I guess that's all till tomorrow.
Oh yeah? That's good.
You working?
Yeah. On the section gang.
My father's the preacher.
What d'you expect?
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
Go on - you can have one!
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
That's why you come back, huh?
I wouldn't have let you.
What d'you mean?
Goin' to see my kid.
Yeah. Well, I do.
That's right.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
Your boy.
How about it?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
We can always do that, Duff.
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
Yeah!
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Yeah. That's right, Jocko.  Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
No.
That's right.
Just tryin' to be helpful.
No thanks, Lee.
That's right.
They'll run you out.
Okay.
I see.  Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Well, that figures.  Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
I'm fine.
I've had quite enough or I wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. Aren't Peter's illusions to your liking?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
She was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
Straylight. Kitchen dock.
It's the people close to me that tend to die... and I get the feeling you and I are going to be real buddies.  Terms?
We'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. One half in advance.
Sense/Net taped a full spectrum personality construct on McCoy six months before his death. Everything Dixie was -- everything Dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  Of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of Sense/Net's.
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
We won't have to. The run is tomorrow night.
Honesty. Almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
Are you even really alive?
Ah, yes... the code. It's a riddle, actually. Some fancy of 3Jane's. Unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. I can no more know that code than I can shut down my own hard wired defences. Now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
What's inside me, Wintermute. What did your doctors do to me?
Fine, Dixie. Fine.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
I an' I, Case. Jah guides us.
It ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. I got the I.D. on this Armitage character. He a bright boy, your friend?
Well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. We gonna run or not?
Less than thirty minutes.
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Case.
There's no call for violence. I've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. You use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. You see, you've been avoiding me, Case.
I can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. That's why I need you, Case. You're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. My "ice" as you call it. I'm doing everything I can to make that possible.
I'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
Then you don't really know who he is, do you?
I know who he isn't. Not C.I.A. Not Sense/Net. But... money comes in. Doors open. He's onto something.
Go ahead...
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
Too late?
Everybody's favourite computer, of course. He may have out calculated the rest of you, but I have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Thanks.
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Right. 7:30.
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
No Roger from op/ed?
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
You crossed over.
Why?
Do I want to be crunched?
Betty.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
You've done five of my ideas.
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Oh. Right.
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
Little known fact.
Yes, desperately.
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
You like her?
I love the way she writes.
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words--  in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Thank you.
I know.
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
Billy Prince is asking you to prom.
Maybe we should sit.
Lock.
Yes.
I know.
I can't help it.
But why?  It's <u>your</u> lunch. There isn't much there in the first place.
He's conducting experiments of his own.
Maybe he doesn't know...
I told you I want that room unpacked.
What is it then?  There's got to be an explanation.  Animals just don't burst into flames for no reason!
Get outa here.
Who told you to choke up that way?
What are you doing here?
You gotta let me stay here tonight, Grady.
Look, I don't care if you believe me or not...
Yeah, yeah, sure.
And heat and chemical reactions. Where does it all go when you die?
What's this?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
I wish you'd talk to me.  We can figure it out, you know.  We can figure it out together.
Will you leave me alone?  Please.
We'll figure it out together.  We'll stay up all night if we have to.  I won't let anything happen to you.
I killed him!  I killed him!
I can't!
Huh?
Thanks, Mom.
The maid packed a suitcase.  Teresa!  Teresa?
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
I've been good.  When do I get cigarette priveleges back?
Don't fucking humor us.  We're not in the mood.
He's real.
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
That was different.
I don't know.
Fuck off.
I'll have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  The patient's rooms are down here.
But Max, she needs me.  It could mean life or death.
We lost a kid about a month ago to Fairview.  I don't know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
Must have opened while I was away at school.
Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
So do I.
Do you?  You told me they're survivors...and they are.  But how much longer they survive is up to us.
I'm sorry, Nancy.  The answer is no.
Doesn't matter.
Everybody take five.
Neil, please --
A young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  The inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  She was raped...hundreds of times. When they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
Frankly, I don't understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
Of course.
Yes.  This one though is... very good.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Yes.  Well.  My pleasure.
Thanks.  Well...
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
Absolutely fine about it.
Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
If that's all right.
You abide by rules like that?
No, I didn't.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
A bath would be great.
I have thought about you.
Well done you.
Brilliant.  Word perfect I'd say.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
Well... how have you been?
Fine.  Everything much the same.  When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately.  Whereas you... I've watched in wonder.  Awards, glory ...
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
I haven't decided.
Nice one.  Would you like my phone number?
Oh dear.  He wasn't friendly during the filming?
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
Yup.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
What's your name?
Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.'
Yes?
Ah... yes, enormously.
Thanks.  I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Really?
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
Good luck.
Absolutely not.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
No -- you're right.
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Oh.  Right.
Bad news.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.'  So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
Yes, thank you, Miss Ratched. Since our last meeting I have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. Naturally, I'm referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... No, no. To personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  Regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... Yes. Yes. The question of... Existence... Relationship... Function... Confront... Yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... Yes, the crisis of our souls. Of our souls, which I am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. Not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... Somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
I-I-I-I-I d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
Tell us about it...
N-n-n-n-no, no, I du-du-du-didn't, I didn't!
Will you come with me, please.
Hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
How 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
No, that's okay, ma'am. Down it goes.
On this ward?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
Go on...
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
No way.
H-H-Harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
God Bless America.
No.
Ca-na-da...
Are they all crazies?
Shhh... That's for me to know an' you to find out.
I don't see you scoring any points, buddy. And you're just the man for the job, right?
Just warmin' up.
Plan?... Oh, yeah, the plan... Yeah...
I said out!
I'm the coach!
What's he talkin' about?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
That's a dime, Martini.
I saw 'em! I saw 'em.
No. Me! Me!
Me, too! Me, too!
My, my... Ah, who are you?
They say I'm a habitual hassler. Like I fight some. Sheeut. They didn't mind so much when I was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. That's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. But if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.
Yes... Ah, do you know why you're here?
I don't, Doc...
You bet, Doc!
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
I'm sorry, but I can't keep you here.
We'll let you know.
What's the horse pill for, honey?
No, 'fraid not...
How do ya know that?
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Ten bucks.
He can't hear you. He's just a deaf and dumb Indian!
Yeah, what's up?
Hallelujah, brother, now get back in bed!
Fine, thank you.  Here, please take these.
No...
He can't hear you, Rose. He's just a big deaf an' dumb indian...
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Big man!
You're a witness, Doc!
Evenin', ma'am.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
I don't know anything about that, Miss. I would have to examine you first...
No, she wasn't my sister.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
You're sure...
Let's find a telephone.
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
My name isn't Damon Bradley.  I just told you it was Damon Bradley.
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
Ha un numero di telefono?
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
Hm.
Beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  Nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. But, I don't know.  An awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
NO.
NO.
Oh.  That's nice.
Nice dress.
I don't know if that's such a--
Hi.  Are you... busy?
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
Yes.
Beautiful place...
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
And more...
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
Larry brought me flowers last night.
But it's July.
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
You're coming with me?
Are you sure?
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Oh.  Right.
You think he misses me at all?
Because I'm the one who's single.
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
It was a ouija board, remember?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Yup.
She's saying he's a-- a--  porco.
I'd love to.
But I do want to.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
He missed me.
Mania.
Thanks.
He just got a call from "Mr. Upstairs." Something's gone wrong. He's plenty hot.
And what in blazes have the nuns got to do with it?
When I was a mere spit of a lad on Ferry Street in Dublin the nuns used to say to me, "Nolan, don't be swallowin' ye words like fishballs. When you got something to say—  —Talk with your mouth wide open," so if I'm loud don't blame me— it's the fault of the nuns!
Why should he forget it?
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
Boss loader!
Don't say that!
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
See! You don't understand!
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
I'm with Terry.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
What for?
The things that go on.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
His— racket?
If you don't  Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
You haven't finished your beer.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Get away from me.
But I feel like— My friends won't talk to me.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
See this arm? It's two inches longer 'n the other one. That's years of workin' and sweatin', liftin' and swingin' a hook. And every time I heisted a box or a coffee bag I says to myself—this is for Edie, so she can be a teacher or somethin' decent. I promised your mother. You better not let her down.
What did you say?
You go to—
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
I'm just resting my feet.
Gimme the names, I'll write 'em down in me little book.
Not a dent.  Perfect
I got it. Hot off the press.
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
Look who says bum!
When we knock off let's have a bit of a party. We'll drink to God and Ireland, its whiskey and its women, to Joey and Edie—  and death to tyrants everywhere... .!
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Nolan... .
No.  It's on a night like this when the best ideas come to mind.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
But horror stories!  Why all the time horror stories?
What help will that do if something in there isn't dead?
It's an initiation all right, but not of a college as you and I know them.  Nothing alive looks like that!
Be careful!--They'll see you.
Oh, no I'm not.  These heathens probably have an open grave for us.
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
Maybe so.
Ahh, she will be yours.
When!?
Ahh, there is yet time.
For what!?!
Now hurry, hurry.  I will watch!  Your desires may be my pleasure also...Our fitting climax to an evening's enter- tainment.  You must...hurry now.
Aaaahhhh.
You need not worry...Not just now, anyway.
Aahhhhnnnaaahahnn. AaaaaahhhhoooWWWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Aaaaannnnnuuunnnuhhhhh?
Aannnnaahhnn.
Without the snake, of course.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Who are you?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
Sounds great.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
So call her up.  Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Shit.
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Or two.
Yes, she did.
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
What?
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month.  Let me do this part alone.
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now.  Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
Where are you?  I been trying to reach you.
What-- we already talked to her.  That's a dead end.
Now.  What is it you wanted to tell me?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
You don't, huh?
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice.  But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five.  Saving yourself for the main event.  Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
I appreciate the offer.  And it's tempting.
Freezing.  But I'm getting warmer.
Who?
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
That's right.
I bet.  How much?
I don't smoke.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper.  Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
We're leaving.
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
I've seen 'em used on TV.
You devil, it's mace, huh?  What've you got here, a billy?  Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
If they get set up in time, which I doubt.  And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
Tell you the truth, I don't know.  I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus.  They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Sure.  I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
It smelled.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
It would be worth the risk.
She did, huh.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Really?  I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
Outside Adele's.
You think I'd shoot you?
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
You think he's lying?
In the trunk?
You know who they are?
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
Any time.
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
I know what you're talking about.
Doesn't have to figure out shit.  You <u>told</u> him you keep 'em at your house.
My ex-wife's in Miami.  It's nice down there.
The fish?
How are you, Richard?
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
The flight?
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
And so now you're off to Glades.
She did, huh.
I remember you now.  Shit.
Jesus.  How'd you know about Snoopy?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Really?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
I know, you'll find me.  Jesus, I believe it.  I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
You crazy, come up <u>here</u>?  It's fuckin one degree outside.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Some<u>one</u>?  Gimme a hint.
I <i>was</i>...
I'm looking for Maurice.
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Technically.  They're separated.
What're you doing at Glades?
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I see that.
Off a tip?
It's possible.  Why?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
That's how you score now?
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
What, good-lookin' sumbitch?
No, I was.
Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley.  We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
You liked that?
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
A m-missionary?
You guys are new?
Home of the brave!
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
So what are you saying?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
I guess I'm used to it.  I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Little less.
And I'm on yours.  Land of the free.
Yes you can.
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
From the air?
Colonel, to f-fight you need strategy. To have strategy, ya gotta practice.  And to practice it, ya gotta play --
Top secret means you help me pick the other pilots, train, and go -- without knowing where you're going until it's too late.
Sorry to trouble you.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
You waited til tonight to tell me?
...Survive?  I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me.  I hit the water hard.  And it was so...cold.
It must of been a convincing letter.
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
The Chinese are sending out search parties to try to find the crews before the Jap patrols do, if any of the planes make it.
God help them.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
Fook ya dooble!
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Wouldn't we all.
Pretty strange.
I call this the staccato. 
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  And the tide rushes in.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That's real big of you.
You're going to listen to me.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
What, why?
First a nerd and then a weirdo. What a bunch of nose pickers. I'll tell Charlie.
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author — fat, violent, drunk...
What're you doing here anyway?
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  At least one more time.
You think so?
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
He'll win.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
What about?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
You look exactly the same.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four—thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
What's that?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
What if you're not here tomorrow?
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Well... uh... thanks...
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
Maybe it takes a while...
I don't know but I'm not taking any chances...
There won't be a next time, I guarantee it.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
What's that mean?!
You want me to give up? Let this thing turn us into <u>victims</u>?
One week old.
Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it.  What can I do for you?
I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners.
My lover and I.
Your... lover?
Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years.
I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started...
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
Joe, from the day I arrived to the day they fired me, I performed consistently, thoroughly and with absolute excellence. And if they hadn't fired me, that's what I'd be doing today.
I'm a lawyer. How's your baby?
Rayisha.
Any settlement agreement <u>must</u> include, and this is critical, a letter of exoneration, making clear my termination had nothing to do with the quality of my work.
Let's find you a drink.
Thank you.
Let me tell you something, okay? When you're brought up, like the rest of us, in a place like where I was brought up, there's not a whole lot of discussion about... homosexuals. As a kid, you're taught right away that queers are weird, queers are funny, they're a danger to kids, they're afraid to fight, and they all want to cop your joint. And that pretty much sums up the general thinking out there, if you want to know the truth.
Beckett?
I know a good probate lawyer.
Thanks.  Do you like opera?
Possessed of an encyclopedic knowledge of the law. A razor sharp litigator, a genuine leader, gifted at bringing out the very best in others. An awesome ability to illuminate the most complex of legal concepts to colleagues, courtrooms, the person on the street.  The kind of person who plays three sets of tennis but doesn't sweat. But underneath the elegant surface, was an adventurous spirit.
What do you love about it?
A good start.
I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing.
Yes.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
Answer the question, please.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection.
Thank you.
No. Have you ever felt discriminated against, at Wyant Wheeler?
Yes.
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's <u>see</u> what we're talking about.
Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
Or unprotected sex with someone you didn't know very well, any time during the last twelve years.
That's correct.
We won.
Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now.
Aren't you?
Get a life.
Lots.
Who?
My lettuce is wilting.
Why didn't you cross at the crosswalk?
Why should I?
Tell Iris all about it.  Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris.  Beckett, come in.
Like... two sailors playing hide the salami.
How did you do that?
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
On behalf of the defendants?
You had one guy "like that?"
Helloooo...
Andy, you don't want this.
You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material?
Charles...
... It's time to get this society back on track!
Not sure. I was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
Okay, it was me. What'd I do now?
Assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
Doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
No, you see, I <u>promised</u> them...I have to...I have to go and....
You barely know them.
It hurts them. Light actually hurts them....
I think I twisted my ankle running backwards like that. And I'm not sure I can....  Okay, that's a lie. I just don't want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me what....
I <u>am</u> sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. And you're playing right into --
What, you think I'm doin' this to prove something?
He's a murderer. The law says he's gotta do his bid.
<u>You</u> made it a problem when you let Owens die like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
I don't get it, Johns. What is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? Huh? Is there anything at all? Besides your next hype?  Got no right to be so scared. Neither one of us.
No, no, you're right, Fry. What's to be afraid of? My life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So I say mush on! Canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in Skiff City! So why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. We're just walking ghosts to her.
Oh, no. Not Owens, not.... Wai', wai', wait. <u>I'm Owens</u>. Right?
You mean that "load" of passengers?
When captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so --
All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall lead us there.
Like an emergency life-raft, right?
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
If you were me, I'd kill us both. C'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
How 'bout a cut in your gut?
About the girl.
Not if I'm the one.
'Cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
It wasn't difficult. Only an apostate or a lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone.  I see you brought along the female of your species.  I didn't realize a man could be monogamous.
I've seen some of your fossils and artifacts. They're worthless.
Don't speak to me in absolutes. The evidence is contestable.
Just the same, I want one.
No one really knows. It's an ancient taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area deadly.
And now you know the truth.  Cornelius has beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
Don't be foolish. If it's true, they'll have to accept it.
-- that the ape evolved from a lower order of primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered traces of a culture older than recorded time -
Because if he is a missing link, it means the Sacred Scrolls aren't worth their parchment.
Zira, listen to me. We've got a fine future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I'm up for a raise --
Right.  Let's put the water and provisions in the wagon.
Don't be silly. He's perfectly tame.
Then we've been away from Earth for eighteen months.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
What would you learn? I've told you where you are and when you are.
There's only one reality left. We're here and it's now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as well be dead.
Always giving orders. Just like every other adult.
I'll start by following the shoreline.  And my nose.
Dr. Zira! Silence that man!
With one of them.
I admit that where there's one mutant there's probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where's your nest, Taylor? Where are your women?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
We're back at the beginning. I still don't know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.
A hearing.
Yeah. Back about 100 metres. He's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
YOU AIN'T A FIRING SQUAD, YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!
Shit. Get your boots on Martin, next time I catch you putting mosquito repellent on your fuckin' feet I'm gonna courtmartial your nigger ass.
I can't do that for you, Red... We need every swinging dick in the field. Sorry bout that... 
Hey Bob, come on! Talk to me hunh, it's your friend Red, I'm only asking you for three days chief...
Bob, I gotta bad feeling about this, I... I'm telling you I got a bad feeling, man, I don't think I'm gonna make it... y'know what I mean?
He's a fool alright but you a bigger fool. Hey, whiteboy, watcha waiting for - dat hole ain't gonna dig itself...
That reminds me, I gotta take a shit.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Only way you'd get some pussy is your bitch dies and wills it to you - and then maybe.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
What?
Barnes comes from Hell.
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
Wrong? You ain't EVER been right - 'bout nothing. And dig this you assholes and dig it good! Barnes been shot 7 times and he ain't dead, that tell you something? Barnes ain't meant to die. Only thing can get Barnes... is Barnes!
...don't feel like it either.
Later...
...there's nobody.
I gotta didi man. Don't wanna miss that chopper. I'll send you a postcard. After I get me some. I'll send you some tapes too man. This new guy Jimi Hendrix man, whew... you okay Taylor? Just 'member take it easy now, don't think too much, don't be a fool, no such thing as a coward cause it don't mean nuthin. Jes keep on keepin' on. Okay my man...
Politics man, fuckin' politics. That O'Neill man got his nose so far up Top's ass he gotta be Pinocchio...
Forty-two days man and a wakeup and I'm a gone motherfucker. Back to de WORLD. 
You a crazy fucker, givin' up college man.
They don't know shit Barnes, and chances are we gonna run into something.
They're on their way...  There's a gook village half a klik downriver, Battalion wants us to move in and search it ASAP, something's going on... where's Barnes?
No I don't. I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, Elias! 
Barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
I remember first time you came in here Taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Very nice Mitchell turns.
I'm supposing.
What's the matter?
Nobody I'd rather have on a leash.
How do you do?
It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
What did you say his name was?
Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
And do you amuse the guests?
Not with my consent, strange as it seems. I don't know how he got in. I don't know anything.
Sure... but somebody always does..
Is this the best you can do?
Anything I can do about it?
From you, I like it.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
They'll look for you.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
It's the frame on the picture. But not if you say so.
I thought you had to be back to the hotel.  To leave my--my note.
But the next one is murder.  First the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  You could tell about Mitchell.  You could tell about Magruder--and the detective. It would hurt, but you could do it.  You could never tell about me.
Yes.  You.  You're not really a murderer yet.
If I did-I don't-now.
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
I'm sorry.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You were a galahad, compared to some cops I've known.
You've had dealings with the police before?
Who hasn't--one way or another?
Nobody can help me. You, least of all.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
Because you think your in love with me?
But even if you were in love with me.
Sometimes.
Not sometimes.  Always.  Just because it is the hard way.  You're that kind of man, Jeff.
We know everything.
This way.
I'm not sure I want anything from you. You might want something from me.
A thousand.
The usual grind.
We do, when we get the chance.
Sure.  Let's discuss Betty Mayfield.  How long since you saw her?
You'd be breaking the law.
That COULD BE TOLD.
She didn't have to.  He could have climbed down from here.
Romeo in reverse.  Uh-uh.  No sale, Killaine.
Where would she go, anyway.  Don't tell me you haven't got her covered.
I'm afraid they do.  Far too often. So long.
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
I saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. You lied. It was obvious.
With what motive?
Swimming with his hat on?  That's original.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Magruder's conked out.  Adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  He may come out of it and he may not.  As a source of quick information, we can't forget him.
So it seems Sergeant.
It's her room. She only got to the Hotel this afternoon,. With him.  I guess he took too much for granted. Here's the gun.
Correct, Inspector. A woman's gun. U.S. 125 caliber ammunition in it. It was on a table in there.
I'll know when I find it.
No suicide.
How about Magruder?
We lifted seven fairly good prints from Miss Mayfield's toilet articles.  Washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
I do.
Two.
What are my orders, sir?
You'd go to jail. For a long term.
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
Unsophisticated?  If I knew about this babe...
What a shame.
Thanks.
If you like.  But don't be too modest, James.  The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books.  You are highly qualified.  You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job.  Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history.  A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Yes.
What went wrong?
Penfield.  James Penfield.
I'm not sure I can face it.
Keep me company.
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No.  That's terrible, Charles. What happened?
Exactly that.
Hello.
And some of that.  Sorry.
You know the lingo.  Jolly good. So your language will have to be simple, not stupid, mind, but simple, very, very simple, and always remember it's an American readership.
That's her.
You don't like flashbacks because your mother's a historian.
It makes me weepy just to remember it.  So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials.  What about yours.
Well, you know...
Yes, if you like.  Call me at work.
Two or three years ago I would have stayed.  And fucked you.
What did he want?
You approve!
Let me see.
The torture of small children--
Tame those rights...you know, we're even freighting in a couple of exiled Argie trade unionists from Paris for a TV tie in.  One of them had his balls tap-danced on by the secret police.  The other one had to be hosed off the wall of his cell after the police-- yes my good man?
Sorry.  Got held up.  What are you doing here?
My God.  You even cooked up that Norfolk trip.
Yes.
Ploughman's Lunch.  Traditional English fare.
Darling Susan.
They won't let you in without one.
Voila!
Promise.
I won't.  Goodnight.
Thanks for stepping in.
Where?
I know that part.  Tell me something I can use, here.
I'll take that as a yes.
She'll be fine, Rosie won't do anything.  At least not as long as I meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
SHIT!!
No.
All the food groups?  Avoiding sugar?  Caffeine?  I see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  We stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
Yeah, sure.  Why not?  You two screw-ups deserve each other. That's why I put you together in the first place.  Christ Pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
It's all balance, right?  And coordination.  How hard can it be?
Johnny, all I can say is we better come up with something real soon.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
No way.  Not yet.  Come on.
Figured you did.
I need you to teach me.
Oh, oh.  That sounds personal.
Meaning you were expendable.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What are you talking about?
Swell's here, Johnny.  Bodhi always knows.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Johnny... what's going on?  I don't get it... did I do something?
Never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
You never did know when to quit.
Why us?
We take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.
I can accept that, it comes with the job.
Thank you, Sergeant.
That's the problem. Apparently they strayed off course.  We're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
Do what you have to do.  I don't take it personally.
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
Not bad for a man who hasn't slept in four nights.  I'll get used to it.
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you?  The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Very good.  You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
Just a romantic, that's you.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No shit.  They expensive?
What are assets?
Five full nights... days too?
All right, two thousand.
Done.
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
Vivian, what the --
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
To meet some friends.  Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
Huh?
What happened to him?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Yes.  The man made a business decision.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Thank you.
And you just happened to run into her.  Great.  What's she do?  She work?
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy.  It's too convenient.
Why?
Edward, we've been together ten years.
Yeah.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
Who did you think?
It was great.
Go for the bucks.
Do I!?  Momma!
Rent.  You're late.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
I'm just looking, thanks.
It's very expensive.
Excuse me?
You survived the Fire Swamp. You must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands The Machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
I swear it will be done.
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
You're a silly girl.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Well ... you were dead.
What? -- go on --
It never happened.
Did you say, "I do"?
I believe you -- So what happens now?
And a good thing too.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
I don't think more than ten.
The body?
Have you any money?
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
Where did you get that?
What?
What is this? Are you trying to trick me? -- Where's the sports? -- Is this a kissing book?
-- murdered by pirates is good --
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
Okay.  All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
My spy network has heard no such news.
I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
It will not happen!
Light him.
The King's stinking son fired me. And thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. While you're at it, why don't you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? We're closed!
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
Sorry.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
Nothing comes to mind.
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
You are ready, then?
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
No one of consequence.
Okay.
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
You know what a hurry we're in.
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
Why'd you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
Yeah, an hour.
Who are you?  What do you want? Why are you loitering in my hallway? Speak, dummy, speak!  Why don't you speak?
I have hurt your feelings.
Well, sir, it seems ...
Exactly.  And how long did it run?
You miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  Don't you ever want to become a butterfly?  Don't you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
I'm not going to jump on you!
Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh.  The man should be in a straight jacket.  Feeling better?
Okay ... Max!  And you can call me Leo.
Oh.
I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange.
Shut up.
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Mr. Liebkind, relax, relax, we're not from the government.  We came here to talk to you about your play.
That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie!  Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill!
That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. 
I'm not crazy.  I'm inept.
Qviet.  Qviet  This is very important.
Of course I need you.  It's dark in there.
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Ta.  Ta.
Bismark...
The Blue Max...
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Send for Goebbels.
We won.
You thought no one has stopped here in weeks. Now, try to remember if this girl...
Suppose I wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would I need a warrant?
I live there. Alone.
Someone is sitting in that window.
Of course not.
Now, look...!
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
Who are you, friend?
What are you talking about?  What is this?
Sam, if she's here...
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Of course not. Please.
Okay. If you'll come along...
I don't need pills... just sleep.
Buzz me the minute she comes in.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
A lot?
Sorry I got you up, boy. Go back to sleep. Yeah, be glad to.  Said to give you his regards.
Your Detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
Well what do you think, we eloped or something? Or we're living in sin and...
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
I feel better when you feel better.
That wouldn't be a wise thing to do.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
Maybe he got some definite lead. Maybe he went right on...
Does that mean we can't...
Yes.
I believe it.
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
I've lost my girlish laughter.
Can you?
I can come down next week.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Hey, we can leave together can't we?
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
I knew you must have. No one stops here anymore unless they do.
There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
Uncommon, too.
Crane.
Yes.  I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Why?
Sorry, Mrs. Chambers. I hate bothering you...
Yes. He traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
Norman found them dead together.  In bed.
Mother, please...
Mother, she's just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
Go on, go tell her she'll not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! Or do I have to tell her, cause you don't have the guts? Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
Nothing. Here, let's clear the path.
Yeah, between the gangsters and the autos, we won't need another war to carry off the population.
Why, yes, to you, Mr.--Mr. --what?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
Yeah, he was picked up-- also the body from the morgue. Say, what did you have to do with stealing that body?
Why, Buckley stole that body. That's what alarmed Mrs. Buckley so. I have been try- ing to get her to put Buckley in an institution but she wants to keep him.
Mind if I look around? Seems to me you have car- ried on some interesting experiments. Sure of himself but taking no chances. MAXWELL Sure, I'll take you thru.
Oh, nothing. He is crazy, that's all. I had a little trouble with him.
I'm going to call the police.
That called ... commanded ...
Yes, the child ...
No?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
The blood transfusion is completed. While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his bandage. The doctor stands bending over Léone.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
It's Igor at the Wax Museum! You'll find your judge embalmed in wax! He's a statue of Voltaire, with all the other corpses! The whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue! 
In the can.  The hoosegow! Mrs. Winton's little boy. The Pawk Avenue Wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  He's in the jail-house now ...
At any time. You will always be welcome.
They are.  My boy, I think you are right. Everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, I am beginning to realize that I am a little tired myself. You can call that fellow in from the front. I think we'll close for the night.
And he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. Let him think it was his fault ... He should be along very shortly .. . But be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  While you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures I have downstairs?
What do you think I am?
It happens that I'm the law.
I'm glad to hear it. When did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? This lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. He's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the Indians.
Hey, come here, Sob-sister!
All right, wise guy. Go ahead. Spill it.
Jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th Street.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
And it came to life and divorced you. I know all about that. Now my idea is this: Somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... Bingo! ... Peddles it to this old skate down there!
No kiddin'?
What do you mean -- haywire? You start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. You start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. You're grand! I'm for you! Stupendous!
How's every little thing?
No kiddin'.
I've got a story for you. You know the Joan Gale girl?
Oh, yeah? Maybe she didn't commit suicide. She may have been murdered!
Plain-clothes man.  Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
She laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... She said she wanted to be friends.
You go in for dangerous things.
But the composition as a whole -- I've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
I will only be gone about half an hour.
Quite so. Quite so.  And you, my little friend, my little Marie Antoinette. It is kind of you to be present.
Yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- I'll need help.
Yes.
God.  I dunno.  The eternal nothingness. Mia.
Dysfunctional --
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
There was this old man that ate his niece.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost.  I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
What is it, Rose?
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right.
Well, nothin'.
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
You're my sweetheart.
Five hundred rabbits?
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
What was your mother like?
Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about.
But how would you find him?
Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder?
True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with.
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday.  Hello, Rose, dear...  ... my, you're... looking pretty...
Yeah.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son.
It always gives me a funny feeling to come home. Dear old Southland. Gone. It's all gone, Daddy --  -- except you, you're still here.
No, son, she is dead.
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Yes, of course.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
The hell we can't.
Honey, that's no way to talk to the Doctor, he's merely doing his job, dear.
Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and...
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Well, it has buttons.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?
Yes, sir.
Well, it was a silly question.
What's the use, there ain't none.
No, you're not.
I see. Outside it.
Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me.  Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane.
Of course she does and I must say I'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. I should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
Well, I am working on my thesis.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me.  You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
I had better call Daddy.
Be quiet, Rose.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
I don't know what you're talking about, man.  Even if I did, I'm not so crazy I'm gonna cross Zimmermann.
This scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the Mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  You think we're gonna let Zimmermann haul it onto <U>our</U> streets on the Fourth-of-fucking-July!?
We should slow down.
I'm just saying...
Yeah.
Okay, seriously.  What about Napoleon, huh?
We're gonna rain on Zimmermann's parade.
I'm back here, aren't I?  So, you don't have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
Follow me.
Just keep an eye out till I get this rig up and running.
This is the police lock-up.  We're police.  How can we steal from ourselves?
What can I say to that... except, I love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
There probably is.
Can't I?
It's our job.
Yeah, non-believer?  Here's yours...  "Scorpio, October 24 to November 22: Jupiter is in conflict with Saturn, so proceed with caution..."
Who the fuck knows?  We'll find out soon enough.
Good.  Thought I was imagining them.
So are you, Pop-Sweet.  That's why...
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
Jabba's palace.
Who are you?
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?
Charges!  Come on, come on!
He wasn't. I can feel it.
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
Here goes nothing.
Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast.
Quiet.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
Never-r-r!
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
Nothing.  Why do you think I should?
Rocky!
You are - so quake with fear, you tiny fools.
Made me give you the eye And then panic,
I really loved the skilful way You beat the other girls To the bride's bouquet.
But where will you go?  We're in the middle of nowhere.
Didn't we pass a castle back down the road a few miles?  Maybe they have a telephone I might use.
It's just a..a party Janet.
It's alright Janet, we'll play along for now and pull out the aces when the time is right.
I hope so my darling.
If only we hadn't made this journey. If only the car hadn't broken down. If only we were amongst friends or sane persons.
You know this earth - this person.
Yes, Dr Scott.  A laser capable of emitting a beam of pure anti-matter.
You tricked me - I wouldn't have - I've never - never
Want to come again and stay
That ain't no crime
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
Oh no no no no.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Oh, lucky him.
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
Shell-shocked!
And you never got the chance?
Morning after?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...Guess.
You sure?
I'll call your brother.
Don't tease me.
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
...I can't beat him.
...I dunno.
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
You's the novelty, Champ!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Get that doctor.
...Stop jivin'!
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Take 'er to the zoo -- Retards like the zoo.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
Hey, give Rocky a dime.
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Few minutes?
Cost ya a buck.
Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
No way -- but the brilliant ability of the Champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- Creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks Rocky. Creed on the offensive -- Balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
Don't mouth me, old man, I'll knock yo' out too. C'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
That's it, I'm broke.
That's it? -- Completely?
...Fine.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Where else am I gonna go.  Bet three grand on Rocky.
No -- Just me.
Did you hear what I said?
Maybe I like garbage.
Why?
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
What was I gonna say?
...What?
...Did ya fight last night?
Think about it.
When was they here?
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
Listen, I'm with you -- But ya gotta talk to Mickey -- I put ya stuff in the bag over there.
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  Please do me that favor.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
You ballin' her?
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
How're you preparing for this Bicentennial bout?
Apollo's a great fighter.
Maybe --
Yeah...
So where is it then?
That's Marvin Acme, the gag king.
That's right, a tweeting bird.  But what does the script say?  'Rabbit gets conked.  Rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  Not birds, stars!
The rabbit's wife?  Wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
Indeed we are.  We'll continue the interrogation there.
I've had enough of your insolence!  Put him in my car.  I think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the Acme factory.
That's what this is all about?  Tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? We got the Red Cars, the best public transportation in the country.
That's because I don't have a doorbell.
Toons aren't given imperfections.
Yeah, I'll bet you would.  You gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
That's not Roger.  It's one of Doom's men.  He killed R.K. Maroon.
We're even.  By the way, I did find your husband.
Marvin told me.  Doom was after his land.  Ne was afraid.  That's why he brought me his will.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
One too many safes dropped on his head?
So what do you want me to do?
So's the job.
You tricked me, damn you!
In other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  Out!  Get out!
Just because you got 'em to laugh?
Well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
I think you want a drink.  How about it, Judge?
Drink it, jerk.  All of it.
What is this, Twenty Questions?
You wanna know?  Well, since you're so goddamn curious, I'll tell ya.  One of you Toons killed my brother.
Get away from there.
Forget it.
From this box here...
Your looks are pale and wild and do import some misadventure.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? [Balthsasr shakes his head no.] No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
But new struck cuz.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness! This is dear mercy and thou sees it not. Hence!
Romeo, come forth.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
[Within] Juliet!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Meaning, to court'sy.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
What?
I don't know.
And then...
That's why you were riding with him.
I drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: Guinness.
It's been known to happen.
I thought I did.
They're part of the team.  One of them's the guy I told you about.
Shut up!!!  Shut up and drive!  I'm your superior officer and you will do as I goddamn well say, is that understood?!?
We weren't real thrilled about it either...
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
Next.
That was a mistake, trying to kill you. Mikhi did it without consulting me, I'd have never allowed it.
Perhaps we could both go at the same time...
You'll die if you leave here.
What's a little hate between business partners?
I got this gig through a contractor. And he most definitely didn't know who was doing the hiring, only that they were paying a lot of money...
Then where is it?
A means to an end, is that it?
Then if you don't mind...  I'm gonna pass out.
Forgive my intrusion into your affairs, but I am the one who connected Vincent to this job, his agent, if you will.  He is one of my oldest friends and I owe him a great debt, much like the debt I suspect he owes you.
I didn't expect that he would.
Created?
It's consider a virtue in some corners of the world.
Coordinate what?
I can do that.
Same thing, isn't it?
I do.
Whatever it is it must be goddamned priceless.
We live in a singular world, my friend.
You see it your way, I'll see it mine. You need a doctor.
Fix it yourself?  Why are we even doing this?  There's no need to run, Christ...  You're a cop.
Sure I do.  You heard him, you heard the guy -- that's what he said, what Edvard said.
Dark operations.  Wet work.  Kidnaping. Assassination.
I know.  Jean-Pierre did.
You speak French.
You better get some sleep, alright?
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
You sure?
You said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?
All depends on whether you want the Russian or the Gaelic language version.
I gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.
I want to get some hounds down here.
Seven thousand...
Shit, more than that.
We don't know whose money it is!  They might have robbed a bank, who knows?
It's going to go bigger than that. Could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
Well, we won't do any of that shit!
You're thinking about killing him.  I can't do that.  No way.  I've never killed a man.  Never even shot at one...
Listen. Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Oh, right, with a little help from his pals Booth and Earl.  I'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
What are you thinking?
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
I don't know!  Shit, give me a break!
Then we're screwed.
What happened?  What's Earl doing here?
What do you mean?  Look.  We can make still make it work.
It's not about the money anymore. Can't you see that?  It's about
None of us like it!
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You're only screwing yourselves over!  Helllllp!  HELLLLLP!  SOMEBODY!!!
What are you doing, Earl?
You mean that guy was an agent?
OK.  I love you.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
Well I was just throwing out ideas...
I'm going to quit.  That's what has to happen first.  Then we're going to tell him.
I don't remember.  We get a lot of people in here.
A week ago, at most.
Thanks for your time.
What?
Speaking of which that reminds me I have to bring something home or eat Sally's meatloaf again, and I don't think I could stand that.
This just might be our ticket!
I wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
That's news to me.  So it's over at Jesse's office?
Hell no. besides I'm just a radio call away if something happens. I feel I should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
Mm-hmm...
Dwayne.
Lingerie...
Oh.
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Uh, sure.  I hear you.
What?
Calm down --
Listen -
Oh Jesus Christ...
So I want the money and I want it now.
You think he skipped town?
Not getting an answer?  For Christ's sake!  Call 911!  Let's get it locked down here!
Did I say dinner?  I meant diner. Biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
How much is that?
I don't think so.
El Capitan?
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge.
It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
Those girls drove off because of you.
Carter, would I lie to you?
Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun.  Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out.
I am a tourist.
Over there -- that's Ricky Tan.
What the hell is going on here?
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it.
How do you know he's our man?
Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
Gimme the binoculars.
She's walking back towards the door.
I don't need a turn!
They don't know that.  What are they gonna do, try and shoot the President during the interview?  I'll bet Isabella can pull some strings.  You saw the way she was staring at me.
You're just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I'm tall, dark and handsome, you're third world ugly.
Fine with me.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
Go ahead.  Sing your ass off.
No problem.
First class.
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Just trying to make it look real.
I'm fine.
That's what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  Never shut up.
There is a ship, in the Hong Kong Harbor...
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Don't you remember?  I'm already dead.
Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people...
No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other?
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
No.
Oh yeah, but this is on the way.  And you gotta see John Wayne's footprints. Everybody does. It's almost like a law. You can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. Tiny god damn feet!
Mr. Carter, I appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason I am here.
The license!  You get it?!
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
Stool pigeon.
Took off. Yes. They took off.
Thank you. I learn a great deal.
You know War?
I could get promoted right out of here.
I wouldn't be close to you.  What is that perfume, girl?
They put you in charge?
What?! This is a class ride, Johnson.
Look at me! My dress is ruined. I look like shit.
How much they want?
Interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
Sir, he's just gonna get in my way. If I'm gonna handle this situation...
He is the situation.
Because with your special talents, I'm sure you'll do a better job.
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
What are you talking about?
Please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
Take the money with you tonight. Pack it in six dragons. You will be contacted again.
After I left?
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
Let me take you back inside, okay?
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
Of course.
"Never say die."
What?
I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent.
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Then you'll be my best man.
I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you.
Thank you.
We think so.
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
No.  I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?"
You don't know.
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Yes.
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
Brian told you that?
I'd rather not.
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
Where?
Why?
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
Lighten up, what?
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Okay.
A harmless joke.
Yeah.
You don't love me, is that it?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
It's on the lake right in the middle of Seattle.  It rains nine months of the year in Seattle.
-- who's married to --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
Nope.
Happy New Year.
Walter, I'd love to --
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Ever since Christmas, you've been different.  Kind of distracted, distant.  But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
Right.
Can too.
No.
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Magic.
Why me? What about Jay?
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
Have you had any relationship since?
Well, okay.  What's the big deal?  If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay.  That's not what I need your help for.  I want to know what it's like over there.
Yeah.  What's that?
Your only hope.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
You're right.  You better hope so.
Right.  I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
This is no good.  She's looking for someone French.  Or Greek.  "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
Somewhere in the middle.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What?
I'm starting to forget her.
Not now, Jonah --
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Did not.
No.
Okay.
I think they're announcing your flight.
I'm sorry --
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
I say we gotta take action. Now.
No, no, it's the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So why you acting so mean?
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
You work alone, savvy? You can't handle the job, I'll find someone who can.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
What's more important than sanitation?
Aaah, what's the use?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Can be what?
I'm going back tomorrow.
We can't go on this way. I just can't go on living with you. Not this way.
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Like what?
Charley's my friend. I need friends.  Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
But honey ...
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
The what!
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
That's it?
Shhh.
What can I do for you?
I'll have to live with that.  My money my risk, my rules.
Just make sure you come alone. This guy won't like any surprises
Then leave.
That's long enough to get out of town.
And you admire that?
It gets me through the day.
I can't tell you.
I want to do this for you.  I want to do something good for a change.
I don't want to.
I found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. I gave my grief to Jesus Christ.
You've got to deal with this sooner or later, Tom. You can't keep hiding.
I know a guy.
My features. They're Finnish.
Sorry.
You're brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. Here.  Have a beer.
Yeah, Pooh-Bear.  Dude is a big-time cook. I'm talking dire.
Palmdale
But why? You only owe me five. And that's not till after we close the deal tonight.
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
What?!
I'll keep that in mind.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You go, boy.
Somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
I can't help it, Tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
Well, if you'd rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
My name is Tom.
Yeah.  What about him?
And he's making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a Colombian necktie on whoever it was.
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
You mean the menacing red car?
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
Yeah, I'd hate to shoot you by accident.
A company, Wehrmacht, no artillery, we took twenty-three prisoners, turned them over to intelligence.
Spit it out, Captain.
In West Fork?
Army life is too dang easy, my feet have gone soft.  Back home, we go out squirrel huntin', I walk forever and a day and then some, don't even raise a blister.
You shut up, this is the most fucked up mission I ever heard of.  Goddamned Ryan, fuck the little bastard.
Reiben, are you makin' fun 'a the way I talk?
I guess.
What deal?
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
Say what, Cap'n?
Pass.
Same place we are.
You don't count.
We in radio contact with anybody up there?
PUSH!
Good news?
No.  It comes and goes.  It stops when I look at it.
You may have to find yourself a new line of work, this one doesn't seem to agree with you anymore.
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Yeah.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
You want me to take over?
Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Please, sir, you can't take me to Ramelle, I gotta go to Caen, sir, please, I told you, they make Caen lingerie there, it's beautiful, it's the best there is, it's...oh, please, sir...
See to it.
Yeah, yeah.  I want you right next to me, no matter where I go, you understand?
Lingerie.
Freaked out.  Trying to keep his eyes on the perimeter.  Can't.
It's easy, it runs in my family, take my grandfather, for example...
Who knows?  It worked.
Look, why don't you check it out for yourself?  See if your father fits the profile.
Well, take a look around the house.  Is everything nice, but not too nice?  Are there lots of, uh, rugs, pieces of art, stereo equipment, uh, furniture, a lot of things bought with cash?  Does he give a lot of gifts?  Do the major items in your house cover around the nine thousand-dollar range?
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
How can you, how can you say that?
Hmmm.  Your income, Mr Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years.
Excellent.
You're sure?
Yeah, I don't want it.  Um, thank you very much.  You're very kind.
Because it's loud enough so the neighbors don't complain, that's how come I know.
I'll be home soon.
I am.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Alright.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours.  Go ahead, open it.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss.  It's all working out for you honey, don't you see?  It's all working out, just like we planned.  All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
No, no, just listen.  You won the Wreath  fellowship.
Wait a minute.  How was Lloyd?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Crash paranoia.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Okay, I give up.
You're going.
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
Yeah?
Yeah.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
So you're monumentally busy?
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Pardon me?
No.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Sure I do.
Twisted?
You think so?
Okay, bye.
What did you say?
No.
I just can't have any social life right now.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
It sounded like you did.
Did you talk to Corey?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
I love you.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Okay.
Man, you're bringing me down!
He's back.  Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
No.
The truck?
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
Okay.  Good afternoon.  Goodbye.
Hello.  Heard about that graduation present.  Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me.  I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back.  I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink.  Kickboxing.  You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future?  Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny [?] merciless, one of the champions of the sport?  I can see by your face, no.  My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
How do you pay for one of those?
Am I going?  Am I going to England?  I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right?  What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy?  There's no way.
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
Mike Cameron.  This is one fresh jam, huh?
I love you too.
It's a beautiful city.
You're kidding.
He's important to my business.
You did, but you didn't.
You're welcome, I'm sure you're doing a great job.
That's great, thanks.
You're a good man.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Yeah?  Yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
Pistols?
Well, they wouldn't own it, I'd own it. I'd pay them back in product.  They can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
But it's less.  It's less than what I would pay a Pole.  That's the point I'm trying to make.  Poles cost more.
Yes.
Well, I'll talk to somebody.  I'll take care of it.
Oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  Look at them.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
37 usages of Himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 Tatum's, 47 Riley's. And that's just on campus. It's hopeless.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
I heard a noise.
Where?
Stop it...
That's okay.
We're co-sponsoring the Acid Rain mixer at the Sig Ep. house tonight.
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
Please, Cotton, don’t do this.
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
I took your vulture seminar seminar at Berkeley last year.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, baby. What can I do'?
No. This is a set up.
Good question. You took the bait.
Aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
And now, drum roll please...
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
Yes, I do retain reading skills. Shock.
I think you're all an act.
I also know that you're an aging TV reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. A coupla failed relationships with--I'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. But I bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
..and as lonely as I am...
Shit! It's both of them. The first murders were to throw us - using the same names as Woodsboro. But they've moved on- -they're getting closer to Sidney. They're not looking for a Himbry or a Tatum to kill. They're looking for the new Tatum.
Over here.
Yeah, right.
Just in case...
No. This is nothing, Dewey. I'll be okay. Go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
Whatever.
I'm everywhere.
Where is your attacker?
I got. I got it. FRIDAY THE 13TH, PART 20.
Is Sid in therapy?
What?
Thanks, Joel.
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
I just love being a sister.
She's not here right now.
But...
Now.
I get scared really easy, okay.
Where you going?
Anytime. Sorry it sucked. It just had that been there done that feeling.
Melinda McGraw?
But your voice sounds so familiar.
You seem to be familiar with the STAB movies. Here's how we play. I ask you a question. You get it right, your girlfriend lives. You answer wrong, she dies.
Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
And who would that be?
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Shit. Sarah Darling.  I interviewed her too. God, it's happening again isn't it Detective?
But you won't. You're a good man detective. We think alike. I know you need my help. And I know you know I need your help.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
What?
She was Randy's only girlfriend . . . ever.
What so you can just exploit her again with another book? Sid doesn't need you Gale.
You're not a detective.
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
What?
Who is it?
No point, I'm just gonna give Detective Kincaid a call.
Wait a second, whoa! Calm down! Number one there were five different versions of the script given out. Ben Damon was given a fake script because he was only being offered the role. It only had fragments of real scenes from the actual script. And what, I die in STAB 3?
Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing?
That's funny.
Milton's not a killer. He's a pervert. He probably went out to buy more KY JELLY for his jack -off parties he has with his two best friends.
Oh come on! Why the hostility?
They're the ones who approved it.
Hi, Gale. I'm glad you're all right.
Who's this.
I know! He killed Kincaid!
All the nightmares. All the hell I went through was because of you, you spineless bastard!
Um hmm...  umhmm great, so let's run the lines.
Page 22, Candy's big moment.
W-what do you want?
No. You didn't kill my mother. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher did.
Heh. So you think Sidney. So you think. It's all been building up to this Sid. Every STAB. Every SCREAM. Every ounce of blood that's been spilled has all been leading up to this moment. WELCOME TOTHE FINAL ACT.
WHERE?
I'll call you, when you're on your way.
I'm sorry, your voice.
It's called tact, you fuckrag.
Sorry.
Oh yeah.
You know what time it is, Sid? It's after midnight. It's your mother's anniversary. We killed her exactly one year ago today.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
So you thought you could sneak in my window and we would have a little bump-bump.
It's been a year since she died.
You lost your mom...
Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
You don't still think it was me?
It's okay. Give me the gun.
We already played that game. You lost, remember?
Why? WHY? Did you hear that, Stu? I think she wants a motive. Hmmm... I don't really believe in motives, Sid. I mean, did Norman Bates have a motive?
I think you have the wrong number.
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.
Uh... NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.
Yeah... Freddy Krueger.
The first one was, but the rest sucked.
Because I want to know who I'm looking at.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Dial someone else, okay?
Or else what?
It's an easy category. Movie trivia.
Name the killer in HALLOWEEN.
Then answer the question. Same category.
Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -- Mrs. Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel.
Am I keeping you? I'm sorry.
Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose.
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
You can't be here, Tatum. This is an official crime scene.
Afraid not.
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
Yes, sir, sheriff.
Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned?
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man.
You think he could still be in town?
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge.
And it had to be you with all your lies and bullshit theories.
Has his story changed?
Why would she lie about it?
Maybe that's because I'm not Randy.
So who are you?
I heard screaming.
...out at the airport...
...so call if you need me.
We had a run in the mass murder section.
There's always some stupid bullshit reason to kill your girlfriend. That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity. Besides, if it's too complicated you lose your target audience.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit.
Wanna another beer?
Don't listen to him. It's him. He's the one.
The official term is "psychotic".
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
How do you gut someone?
It's past seven.
Created by that little tabloid twit Gale Weathers.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
So far it's all dead ends.  No credit history.  No employment history.  His bank account's only five years old and it started as cash.  We're even trying to trace his furniture, but for now all we know is he's independently wealth, well educated and totally insane.  We may never know how he got that way.
I'm in.
So what?  This victim...
Greed.  It was written in blood.
I thought you might want to be filled in.
Can't you feel it yet?  Can't you feel that feeling... ?  You're not going to be a cop anymore.
I can breathe withour pain now, so I guess I feel great.
Who tied her down?  You or him?
It's not too far away now.
Spit it out.
Well, I'll be standing beside you the whole time, so you be sure to let me know when this whole, complete reality thing is done.  Wouldn't want to miss it.
You should be thanking me.
Sit back.
It's close.
I want you to know, I wish I could have lived like you do.
I'm here for the same reasons as you, I guess.  Or, at least, the same reasons you used to have for being here before... before you decided to... quit.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
Not here.
Please be quiet for a while, would you?
I don't know.  Feel free to look for yourself, okay?
Guessing at this point is useless.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Yeah, well, all I want is...  Just, just don't be jerking me off.  That's all I ask.  Don't jerk me off.
Have you found any plastic scrapings near the stove or sink?  Near the food?
What?
How's that?
What about them?
I'm certain.  He was the biggest defense lawyer around.  Infamous, actually.
Well, his body was found Monday night, okay?  But, get this... the office was closed all day Monday.  Which means, as long as the gluttony killing was done before the weekend, our killer could've gotten in here on Friday.  He could've spent all day Saturday with Gould, and all day Sunday.
He cut along the side of his stomach.  The love handle.
Oh, that's all.
I expected it to be bad, you know.  I took a human life... but I slept like a baby that night.  I never gave it a second thought.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
A landlord's dream tenant: a paralyzed man with no tongue.
Who pays the rent on time.
It's too dismissive to call him a lunatic. We can't make that mistake.
Legal... illegal.  These terms don't apply. I don't applaud it.
I'm trying, alright?  Just tell me what we've got.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
Big surprise.
When do we get to question him?
Put the gun down, Somerset!
What?
It's a hard place.
I'm sorry, I only...
What you saw was a buck wearin' Lucy's dress...  I found Lucy back there in that canyon...I wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands...I thought it best to keep it from you -- long as I could.
As to that, I don't know, Charlie... We hadn't got around to talkin' marriage...
If you're talkin' about that crazy murder charge...
In that case, give the boys room...
Dunno...Seems so.
Well, go get cleaned up and we'll proceed with the weddin'...
Yes sir...
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
You said there'd be a thousand dollar reward.
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Well, fust off...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
YOUR cattle?...<U>DEBBIE'S</U> cattle!
How? You got any horses, or money to buy 'em...You ain't even got money to buy cartridges...Jorgensen's offering you a good livin' here...
Yeah...you want me to know I ain't got no kin -- no money -- no horses -- nothing but a dead man's clothes to wear!..You tole me that already... Now shut your head!
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Never heard of him...
You can keep your will!  I ain't forgettin' you was all set to shoot her yourself...What kind o' man are you, anyway.
She's been with the bucks! She's nothin' now but a...
She's alive...Better she's alive and livin' with Comanches than her brains bashed out...
Hard to realize they're white, isn't it...
They're not white any more -- they're <U>Comanche</U>!...Let's see the bodies...
I've seen her...and she's alive.
From the beginning...
I gotta catch up with him, Laurie!
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
It still worked in town.
I went to see Prof. Roth!  You know, I had another one of those dreams last night.  I saw Tommi!
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
1976.  What happened back then?
Peculiar?  You mean, like back then?
Mercutio
Ah
My Massacre at Paris is complete.
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
You did. But Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it as the Rose.
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
I have lost my gift.  It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
On my mother's side the Ardens
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Yes, I saw it.
Oh, that.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
I don't know, it's a mystery.
What do we do now?
The show must … you know
And yours?
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.
"Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?"
"Of love?"
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.
Be patient, my lord, she is dressing.
Be still.
I am not so well-born.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
I have lost my gift.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
I'll be damned if you are!
Oh. What is your name?
Can you love a player?
I am.
No, the morning rooster woke me.
It was the owl--come to bed
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
I don't know. It's a mystery
Write me well.
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
Thomas Kent. I would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.
She sings too?
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Victory is the same as defeat. It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.
Alex, I don't have the time --
No.
Dig the pit, I don't know.
No, not that.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Can we talk about something?
Security.
No, I'm sure, that'll be enough.
They can know all they like, it won't do them the slightest bit of good --
They know? So what? They have nothing, there is nothing, to connect us to that bodies stuff.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
You old devil. Well, anyway, as you can see, we're leaving.
I don't know anything about it.
Take another look at these two.
Sorry to waste your time.
Oh, yes, it's great.
Just serve.
Yeah, he had one too many of thise urges. You of all people should know that.
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
What? Oh, yeah, sure, if you want. I tell you, every letter this guy writes to you is the same: they all begin like pure love and descend into open pornography. I dream of your thighs, the soft touch of your white skin leading me in desire, while I, aroused and inflamed --'
A miserable, burnt-out, empty shell of a -- Alex pauses, looks at his drink, then at Juliet.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
What?
I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
What's he doing here?
Who was it?
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
Looking after it -- he's probably fucking well eating it.
And the money?
No.
We were just sorting things out.
Don't worry about it. I'd do exactly the same, but I don't think I'm his type.
You were going to say something.
What was I trying to say? Oh, yes, I think, we think, or at least I suppose we think -- am I right?
Well, that's what I said, isn't it?
What about?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
There are only two other people in the flat.
Who said there were four?
We understood there were four people living here. Not always, of course, but now, four.
No, three. Who said there were four?
I don't know. Maybe I'm a light sleeper.
Keep it going, Alex. You're unstoppable now.
No.
No one.
Right here?
There's a whole wide world out there, and it all needs to be accounted for, doesn't it?
But they sneer, don't they?
And that's why I think you fit in here.
I'm boring?
That one, last week.
What's it about?
No.
I'm a doctor.
Air Portugal, on the other hand, via Lisbon, same day, five hundred and sixty-five. Five six five. It's up to you. Catering important?
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
Is it real?
I don't know, I think...
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
What do you expect me to do about it?
Why not?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Nummers.
What?
I don't want to place you in any position --
What kind of treatment?
What're you doing later?
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
Right now, I just don't care.
You know what I'm talking about.
I guess so.
Okay.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
Well, are you? Are you queer?
No shit.
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Yeah...
Look...  Do you wanna fuck me?
Right, that's right.
You do know what money's like these days.
Well, yeah... you know.
Yeah.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
Can't you do it out here?
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
What's wrong?
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
-- what?
You don't think so? I do.
He still having parties?
Am I entertaining you?
-- ass and legs --
She's murdered her hair... you do something with her, I'm never going to touch her again.
-- Otis?
-- yes, George.
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
Not yet.
Nothing, I reconciled with Ron, you know, the guy I divorced last summer.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
What?
How?
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
I am?
But in the same house, you know, one house.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
Yeah.
Could I talk to you for a second?
Go where?
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
A business meeting, I told you that.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Television or movies?
-- okay --  -- I'll see you later. Your house.
What is.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Did you?
George...
What did you say?
You need a cut.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
... this doing hair it's...
-- yeah?
Lester, it just happened.
Yeah.
Is that right?
Does she know about us?
I'm not. Maybe I am.
I guess not.
Don't be silly.
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
What?
Well, there was this one time --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
He's a hairdresser.
Let's do that.
Three weeks.
No.
Do you have something against traveling?
John...
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Everybody but us.
-- we're going to be here all night.
They had to, in order to survive.
Who's Tony?
Tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
Yes.
Do they know he tell you things?
Well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
Okay.
All right.
I won't make any noise.
Mommy... Mommy...!
Mommy saying, 'Wake up, wake up, wake up Danny, wake up.'
Talking to Tony.
Well it's just one of those things. You know... purely an accident, um. My husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he wasn't exactly in the greatest mood that night.  And well Danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. It's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured Danny's arm.
Great.  Sit down.  Oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. Coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
Good evening Mr. Torrance.
It's not a matter that concerns you, Mr. Torrance - at least not at this point.
Yes.
It's okay.  It's okay, now.  Really.
I think he did it to himself.
You mean just leave the hotel?
I just want to go back to my room.
Stop it!
Jack, stay away from me!
Oh, well - come on in Jack.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ullman.
Well, that just happens to be exactly what I'm looking for.  I'm eh... I'm outlining a new writing project, and eh... 
can of itself be a problem.
They'll love it.
Well, that is eh quite a story.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Oh... Has your luggage been brought in?
Oh well they're really gorgeous. As a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.
Royalty?
Don't tell me what I have to do and what I don't, booger-brains.
Hey, take it easy. I know how you feel.
Well, I'm not sure that was. Christ! They better get the guy.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
Don't call me dear boy.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
I called Peltzer on my way over here, Marty! Father Lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. That's a fancy way of saying eyewash. He's got a corneal inflammation.
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
There! You see!
Oh?
I haven't enjoyed Mass this much in years.  What a marvelous program. Innovative.  Inspiring.  You are to be commended.
Really?
Well... yes.  Yes it is.
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
I think they hear you!
HE'S SO FINE...
What?
That... thing.  That nun thing.  Take it off.
Who?  The other woman.  Your wife.
Right.  Yeah.  Forgotten.
Oh my! 
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
The Dixie Cups?  Oh my.  I was just a girl.  Of course.  SPRING IS HERE THE SUN WILL SHINE
It's true -- I know her.
I like my old convent, in Vancouver. Out in the woods.  It wasn't all modern, like here.  No electricity.  Cold water. Bare feet.  Those were nuns.  It was Hell on earth, but I loved it.  This place is a Hilton.
Whatever.
Mary Robert.
I knew that.
Hopeless I
Babies
You re okay -- for a civilian.
She said that?  Reverend Mother?
What?
Reverend Mother says you need experience, right, in life.  In order to make a responsible decision.  This is going to be very painful for me.  You know how much I love this little room. This whole convent.  Wait.
Of course!  We must do it!  It's the will of God!  What is it?
Well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  I mean, nothing really happened.  We just... took a walk.
A thank-you?  For what?  You're the one we should be thanking.
Right to Hell.  Just kidding. Where is that bus?
It's true!
Your name?
I see.
You see?  You see?  I have to get out of here   I have to make a phone call. Don't you get  it?  I'm in a convent! You're a nun!
What?
What? 
Are you talking about me?
And all those like you.
No problem.
Your cell.  Your room.
Right, sure thing.  But what about, like, appliances?  Like a little color portable?  Boom box?
Your cell is more than adequate.
Wait.  No.  You're kidding.  Lights out? At nine?  My day's just starting.
Have you been out in those streets?  Do you know what those kids are up against? You should help them!
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
What?
What do you mean?
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Very well.  I hold you responsible for all of this, For introducing a lounge act into my convent.  For utterly disrupting our way of life.  And for placing all of us in mortal danger.  Thank-you.
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
He didn't do you a favor.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Like what?
I really can't talk about it now.  The place is packed.  SRO.  I've got a show to do.
Me too.
I think they'd understand.
Nuns?
It's a bluff, Vince.
Not... totally.
Really...
That was exciting!
She wasn't a nun?
I lied.
Excuse me?
You need to sleep.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
They need guidance.
Wallowing quite literally in blood.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
Pardon me?
Must we again hear these heretical rantings?
For one who calls himself a Federalist, your mouth reeks of Republican liberalism.
No, sir, no.  If you ask me, I say you just laid eyes on our murderer through that glass.
Why would he flee this direction, with so much open ground to cross before he reached cover?
I know it.
At times I do.
Up.
Witches do not exist.  However...
Stay back.
Why this tree?
To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place.
Intestate.  Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
What books?
Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns.
You do not know all that has happened.  You cannot understand.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I know.  Hold on.
Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds?
My suitor?
Are you so superstitious?
Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny.
No, actually, you were not.  Every word you spoke had truth in it.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
What did he say, Katrina?
Very little.  I must be going...
Sit.
Doctor, he is awake.
May I see my mother?
She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is?  All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul.
Karl, they's a blanket up in under that cot and soap in the bathroom to clean up with.  Now there's one more thing. The way we lock these doors at night, you can't get out. You didn't want to go anywhere, did you?
I can't remember.
We order from Dairy Queen at noontime usually. We can buy your lunch till you get on your feet a little.
Well, I'm gonna pay you today for this comin' week, so you'll have some walkin' around money. When you get off this evenin' you better go buy some toothpaste and cleanin' up supplies to have back there. Some hard candy and some magazines. Somethin' to keep you busy at night.
All right then.
Aw, pretty good. Kids are drivin' me crazy and Phyliss is gonna put me in the poorhouse. Can't complain other than that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.  Do you know Scooter, Jerry?
Sixty for small and seventy-five for large.
Ain't you got no mama and daddy to tend to it?
You sure are hung up on people bein' sweet.  Speakin' of which, where's your girlfriend? I thought he was comin' by here for something.
Boy, ain't you somethin' else. Talkin' back and everything. It kinda makes me horny when you talk back.
It went real good.
You might want to find out. He might of hacked his family to pieces with a hatchet or somethin'.
You be quiet, Frank, we're talkin'. The adults are talkin'. Were you in the lockup for cuttin' somebody up with a hatchet?
Don't talk about daddy. Y'all go on to the garage and let me be.
Don't rush ever'body, honey.
Sure. It sounded like a number one tune all right.
Come on, don't be a pussy. Everybody has to work.
Oh, yeah, I'm thrilled.
I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
Well, I can't understand none of it. This one begat this one and that one begat this one and begat and begat and begat and lo somebody sayeth some shit or another. Just how retarded are you?
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
How come you're carryin' them around with you.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
It's okay if you're lookin' out for yourself. If it's self-defense. Was it self-defense?
I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.
Hit was right thoughty of her.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I bet he will. I got a little money if he don't. I'll get 'em for ye.
They ort to. You're a good boy.
Naw.
And I don't try to touch her. You know, in a bad way. Foolin' around, sex and all.
What do you mean?
'Cause it's fun. It don't matter if you ain't no good. It takes your mind off of everything else while you're doin' it. When you run real fast tryin' to make a touchdown you don't think about anything else. I ain't no good, but my daddy always said he was proud of me when I threw a ball or ran with it. Did you have any brothers and sisters growin' up to play with?
I've studied about it. The Bible says not to or you end up goin' to Hades. Some folks calls it Hell, I call it Hades.
We'll be on teams, me and you?
Just diggin'.  I ain't ever gonna be happy now. Not with that son of a bitch movin' in for good. I wish me and you and Mama could just run away. But she said he would find us wherever we went. He's crazy. Sometimes I think it would of been better if I wadn't ever born.
Hit don't make no difference where I was to be. We'll always be friends. There ain't no way to stop that.  I aim for you to have these books.
Man. Thanks.  You know when you get a feelin' and you don't know why?
Yes sir.
I've got a feelin' today.
Will ye do somethin' for me if I ast you to?
You know I would. Whatever you want.
He ain't ever okay to me.
We don't need to think bad thoughts, do we Mama?
Is everything gonna be all right someday? I just stay nervous all the time just about.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now.  I love you.
Well, when you like pricing items as much as I do, I guess it's just bound to happen sooner or later.
I reckon.
Yes, I guess you are.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
You better go get 'em.
I reckon.
I never was no good with history.
He's a-carryin' me to look fer work in Millsburg where I was borned.
I wouldn't mind a havin' supper.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
They turned me loose from the state hospital.
That dern Doyle is in a bad way again with that drinkin' and bein' mean to folks. Will you give me your word you'll do it?
I'm sorry.
As much as anybody else is, I guess. Y'all have a good rest of the day now.
You mean about y'all bein' together in "that" way?
Perhaps I should rephrase the question. What I mean to say is, are you married or seriously involved with a significant other?
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow.  It doesn't seem to be too long.
Thanks. I knew you'd understand.
Do you think I could buy some before you leave?
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
But they're all the same.
Hey, kid. You interested in a job? I just got word from your employment agency that you're looking for a position in retail sales.
If he's got something to tell me, why don't he tell it to me himself?
Not a peep.
It's Tommy's. The sucker owed me a favor.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
That's a feather in your cap, man. The paper of record.
Yeah, great. The problem is, I have four days to come up with something, and I don't have a single idea.  You know anything about Christmas stories?
Ready. Any time you are.
I'm all ears.
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
You're conning me, sweetheart. I ain't responsible for no baby.
Fifteen years ago?  It won't wash, pumpkin. No mother waits fifteen years to tell a man he's a father. I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
You what?
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Bully for you.
No, bully for you.
No thanks. I don't care what you do, but just make sure you don't get caught, okay? The last I heard, it was still illegal to sell Cuban cigars in this country.
Come around to the cigar store tomorrow morning at ten o'clock and we'll talk about it, okay? We'll see what we can work out.
When I tell you it's open. It's open when I tell you it's open!
Seventy-eight dollars. The girl who rolled these was probably wearing panties.
Forty-four. They're on special this week from the Canary Islands. A real bargain.
Well, whatever his name is, he's not here anymore. He left two days ago, and I haven't heard from him since.
That's what he said. He told me he lived with his mother and father on East Seventy-fourth Street.
Those are pretty hostile words.
Jesus.
It's a free country, isn't it? As long as I'm not trespassing on your property. I can stay here till kingdom come.
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
Hi there, little brother.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
Help? What the fuck do I need your help for? I've got a man, don't I? That's more than you can say for yourself, Hawkeye.
Yeah? And why is that?
Management. Those guys are walking around with their heads up their asses.
No, wait. You can't just walk off.  You saved my life.
Yes it is. It's a law of the universe. If I let you walk away, the moon will spin out of orbit ... pestilence will reign over the city for a hundred years.
You must eat lunch pretty early. It's only eleven o'clock.
Yeah, that's right.
You'll find juice and eggs and milk in the refrigerator. Cereal in the cupboard. Coffee on the stove. Take whatever you want. But it's time for me to get started in here.
Appreciation for what?
I bought it. Twenty-nine ninety-five on sale at Goldbaum's TV and Radio.  Well, that just about takes care of it, I guess. You'll be able to watch the ball games. You know, as a little break from your work. 
I don't, huh? And what makes you such an authority on what I want or don't want?
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
One sip of this stuff and your eyes will blast open.
Come on, just a little hint.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
His only copy?
Christ. You didn't just see what happened. They dropped the package on the ground and you picked it up.
Good thinking.
Yeah, well, you have to be nuts to do what you did. If you want my opinion, you should give this money back to the Creeper. Just give it back and tell him you're sorry.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
I suppose so. He never told me about it.
I'm not going to do it.
You'll do it, all right. You fuck up, you've got to undo the damage. That's how it works, buster. If you don't do it, I'm going to throw you out of here. Do you understand me? If you don't pay Auggie what you owe him. I'm finished with you.
Wow. They sure did a job on you.
Hot coffee or iced coffee?
Oh, yeh?
You scraped the dried blood from the <u>butt</u> of the gaff.  Where a fella's <u>hand</u> goes.  And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
Easy.  Slow is best.
There's no one here, and I've <u>got</u> to talk to you.
Seattle boys think he's guilty.  They say the evidence is rock solid.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
All right.  What did your son <u>say</u> to that effect?
No, sir, I can't.  Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
He said he didn't want that life no more.  He'd been saving to buy a farm.  He was sorry I got sick. But pretty excited to get back his father's place.
Yes.
Since September.  Last guys got transferred.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
You're right.  I better use two.
Yes, he was.
To my father.  Everything counts.
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely.  We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  Just below the mast.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
It's a rare thing.  Takes a turning point.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is <u>first</u>-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
No.
Apparently.
I don't think so.
You don't.  <u>Remember</u>.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
Carl never lied.
That's up to you field guys.  H.Q. wants you to break 'em in when you do the annual security sweep in January.
Okay, doll.
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Now cut that out, girls-none of that rough talk.  They went to a conservatory.
Yeah.  Why?
You're right, Joe.
First thing tomorrow we're going to pay everybody a little something on account.
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
What are you worried about?  This job is going to last a long time.
I thought you weren't talking to me.
Knock it off, will you?
No - nothing.  Besides, it's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off -
With those legs?  Are you crazy?
The name is Josephine.  And it was your idea in the first place.
Polish?
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
Blow where?
How can we?  We're broke.
We can get a job with another band. A male band.
Listen, stupid - right now Spats Colombo and his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country.
What's the beef?  We're sitting pretty. We get room and board - we get paid every week - there's the palm trees and the flying fish -
This happens to me all the time in public.
And where's he going to be?
Oh, no!  Not tonight, Josephine!
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Like what are you going to do on your honeymoon?
We can't just walk out on her without saying goodbye.
There you go with that we again.
There's a convention, all right.  There's also the ladies' morgue.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
Oh, I can think of a million things -
Stay as long as you'd like.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
I have a very low resistance.
I know where to get some.  Don't move.
So spill it.  Spills, thrills, laughs, games - this may even turn out to be a surprise party.
I mean, your shoulders - and your arms -
You're so flat-chested.  Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Now look, Daphne - hands off - I saw him first.
Yeah - Josephine.
I guess she's not in here.
That's funny.  Josie -  I can't imagine where she can be.
You like it?
- you got to be blonde -
Look, if William Morris doesn't come through -
I am Osgood Fielding the Third.
You don't say.
Bull fiddle.
Wanna bet?
I'll throw up!
They got a Cuban band that's the berries. Why don't we go there - blindfold the orchestra - and tango till dawn?
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
Why not?
Well, to begin with, I'm not a natural blonde.
Oh, that's all taken care of.  I'm giving them shore leave.  We'll have a little cold pheasant - and champagne - and I checked with the Coast Guard - there'll be a full moon tonight - oh, and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records -
It's three weeks in Florida -
Nellie, get me long distance.  What is it?
William Morris!
You two from the Poliakoff Agency?
Would you mind rejoining the living? Goose it up a little.
On the Baltimore and Ohio.
Better keep a lookout.
I'm not very bright, I guess.
Then why did you take this job?
That so?
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
Brains aren't everything.
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Why not?
Are you staying at the hotel?
And who mixes the cocktails - your wife?
I'm not interested at all.
That's very interesting.
I'll bet just while we were talking, you made like a hundred thousand dollars.
Could be.  Do you play the market?
For your own amusement?
You see, I have this theory about men with glasses.
I only come ashore twice a day - when the tide goes out.
Shell Oil, Junior.  He's got millions - he's got glasses - and he's got a yacht.
I am?
I wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in.
Bon voyage.
Oh, it's perfectly safe.  We're well anchored - the ship is in shipshape - and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there are any icebergs around.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
Thank you.
I knew you would.
Goodbye, my darling.
Show the gentleman to the chapel - pew number three.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Some people got no respect for the dead.
We got different information.
Big joke!
Me and those two witnesses whom your lawyers have been looking for all over Chicago.
We thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie.
What for?
Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
Pub Golf?
Why should this be any different?  Besides, I have to initiate Nick into the family.
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
Um, just about everyone.
It’s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  You did the right thing.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
I have regrets.
Kat, stop it. You do. You can’t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
Love.
You’re too good for him.
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
It’s okay. Hell, I’ve never paid for it. But please don’t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Oh, no.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
You have more than one gynecologist?
You knew?
You want me to let him in?
Meet Nick.
Then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
Is there any other way to take it?
No, mam... I come from way back there. Me and my dog was tryin' to find my daddy and we got lost.
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
It was the best thing I ever been to, Miss Johnson!
My daddy likes to look into the dark, even when there ain't nothin to see -- it's what you hear he say.
But where is my daddy!?
Yes, Miss Johnson...
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
Yes, sir...
I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
Yes, sir...
Do you think he's dead, Daddy?
Yes, ma'am...?
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Some books Miss Johnson gave me.
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
It's the heat.
Thank you, Miss Boatwright.
Yes mam... We gotta go, Miss Boatwright.. .
No, thank you -- I gotta go do some work in the field today.
What did the Lord tell you, Ike?
Don't belong to you! It's for the little important man, here!
I wanta get some things.
I'd like to help you, Rebecca. But all that would do, is git us both in trouble.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Of COURSE!! Ice cream!!
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Eric!
About Cheesy Poofs, dumbass! This whole thing has gone too far!
Yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
pie and punch... This is Top Secret. The password is...
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
WAGAGAHGHGH!! YOU GUYS!!! SERIOUSLY!!!
I don't know honey. Soon we hope. You want it to end quickly, huh?
Mkay, kids from all over the State have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. Uh, young man... Let's start with you.
Mkay, you see, children. This is exactly what I'm talking about. We have to change the way you think.
Eric!!!!  You need to be rehabilitated. Help me to help you!
Children, I know ALL there is to know about women.
Uhh...
Mrph mprph!!
Kay.
We can't leave without you!
Wow!
I'll just try the first one.
Yeah, thanks for going back to hell for us. You're a real pal.
Yeah, so what if you say uncle raper or dicksucker or, or-
YES! AND I WILL NOT ALLOW MY CHILDREN TO BE RUINED BY SMUT!!  I am sorry young man, but I have had it up to here! STRAP THEM IN!
We're going to find our boys! For God's sake Sheila, you almost had them killed!!
Not necessary?!  Mr. President, may I remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! The bastard Canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. Well, if it is war they want... THEN WAR THEY SHALL HAVE!!!
Yes?
Oh.
What is Terrance and Phillip?
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
<b>SHUT YOUR FUCKING FACE!! UNCLEFUCKA!!! YOU'RE the one that fucked your Uncle, UNCLEFUCKA!!! You don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn You just fuck your Uncle all day long!</b>
Is sex the only thing that matters to you?
I know.
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Come on guy, you know I only rib you because I love you so much!
If you love somebody then you treat them with respect!  You've never respected me!
Listen guy, you're embarassing me in front of my friends!  You know how I get mad when I get embarassed.
Well get used to it, 'cause here we are, on the cruise of a lifetime.
Koros, as in...Koros?  Dimitri Koros?
So...
I am here to provide service to... to all our guests.  There is a high level of passenger dissatisfaction. It is my duty...to report this.
The device has stopped responding.
I hear you Mac and I appreciate it. Frankly I don't know what I'd have done without you on this one.
There must be some mistake. You sure you hit the right commands?
Yes I'm sure I hit the right commands.
Why, didn't they say?
Why yes Ryan, I am, and thanks for asking.  You don't have to talk to the intercom, I can hear you fine.
Who said I'll re-enter in the pod? I got friends out in space, Ryan, friends willing to get me back unnoticed.  Thank God for deregulation huh?
Will you transmit the distress signal?
Well don't drag your ass.  There won't be much of a window for us to link up.  We'll be in your orbit trajectory in less than two hours.
I know, I know.
Well blaze your ass out of there! You've completely altered your trajectory, are we linking up or not?!
Goddamn it Barnes this really steams my onions!
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Like open an airlock by mistake?
I'm sure you'll be all right.
Actually I've logged about 200 hours of simulated space walking at the institute, mostly related to starship construction.
Wait.
Look I know what I'm doing. I have experience and training in space walking.
Simulated space walking.
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Sure.
Helllp!
We don't have enough suits to get the others out.
No...
What?  What are you talking about?
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
No, just enjoying the view.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
Ah hell we can always do that. Listen believe me, once we get to the moon, your tone is going to change.
Send it back if you don't want it.
Who are you calling a pig, rummy?
What makes you so sure?
Yes I know all that.  Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
You're not from around here, are you?
Can I get you something for the road?
Pinhead! Don't just blurt it right out.
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
You listen to the feelings, not the words.
gambling. And it was a safe place for kids, a place where the whole community could meet for some wholesome, clean fun.
I know your face, you're an up-and-comer. You bowl on the tour.
100 years! 
I can appeal in five. I was hoping you could help me Mr. Fazeli.
Who gave it to you?
Grace Skinner.
You knew her. You married her in 1963.
Don't say that about my mom!
He'll be a barnacle on your ass the rest of your life.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
I'll tell you one thing, you won't see me around that alley with that freak on the loose. Stay away from his ass - and don't play any of his fuckin' knock-knock jokes.
You know who I am?
Bowling "Center"!
I'm sorry about Zeus, Millie.
This is a sign! Someone's coming to take Buzz away from me. I don't know if you're the guy or what, but I'm not letting it happen. I'm leaving him first.
I'm not here to - I can't...
Won't your father help you with that?
When I'm on my bike I feel like a wild person.  Better than any sex I've ever had.
Everything has it's drawbacks.
Do you have a girlfriend?
I don't know. It's all I ever wanted to do.
Plan B is your dad.
I'm a credit card junkie. I went on a binge and my dad bailed me out. Now I'm trapped in his easy payment plan.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
Zip.
Too late for what, Sheila?
It's Junior, isn't it.
Plan C. From now on it's gonna be plan C. Both bodies throb and grind, their sandy hands sliding over each others' sweaty skin.
I didn't come this far to bury a guy that's not my dad. He owes me.
Fuck plan C!
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
So, Buzz was stooling for you guys.
I'm the next of kin. I should've seen him.
Please, Dr. Levine.
They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky.
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
I said back away.
Shut up, Beth.  I don't want to hear it.
From what?  What's with all the security?
What?
Not really, no.  Something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you've kept everything a secret...  When did it crash?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
Extraordinary, isn't it?
I'm afraid it is Dr. Johnson... because it's sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
I don't know.  But it's something alien.
I don't know.  That's the point.
Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant.
I told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless I say.
She should've known better.
When was this?
So you knew this when you wrote your report?
That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence.
Edmunds?  Can you copy?
Jerry?  Please.  Stop this.
Right.  So you're saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
Then how can it be chipped?
We know how this craft got here. Where it's been.
It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
Nobody goes inside, until we know <u>what's</u> inside.
Internal power.
In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
I love secrets.
That's quite a secret.
Underwater?
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  In the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman.  That's first grade geography.
We have a library?
What do you mean -- not normal?
And you didn't tell anyone?
Nobody said... Norman...  What?  Why are you looking at me like that?
So what?
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
Beth --
He what?
Fixing it?  But I fixed --  Where'd you get all that?
Wait a second --
You think, in the sphere --
I don't know.
Valdomet.
Ulcers.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
To be on the safe side.  I mean --
Not believing you.
How's Harry?
Then why, Beth?  Why go in?  Why put out explosives?  Why manifest the snakes?
Yes, someone did.  But it wasn't me, Norman.  It was you.  You manifested the snakes.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
That's when you went in the sphere.
Did I?  Or was that you?  When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman.
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name?  "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, <u>Harry</u>, it'll be fine, it'll be fun."  You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
But I have to, Norman.
It's not safe for you to be either.
Get away from the door, Beth.
It doesn't make any sense.
Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this.
On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
Gimme another explanation.
That far in what, Harry?
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit.
How do we decode it?
You know what it is, Harry.
Shut up and catch.
You mean forget?
To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know.
Just one of Norman's many secrets.
It's been obvious from the start, hasn't it, Captain?  That's why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
Arrived?  From where?
Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves.
Thank you.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
The ships?
What was that, sir?
Know what?
You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do?
Like what?
Please, Ted.
Why's that?
In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you?
Don't be so supportive, honey.
Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news?
Their bases are very well hidden. All the power of the Empire can't find them... Do you know where they are?
I'm not taking you on an impossible search across the galaxy... I was only paid to get you here and now you're here.  I'll take my other five thousand and you're on your own... I'll leave you on the nearest system.
I'm beginning not to like you.
There is a greater risk in staying here, you know.  If you don't find the princess, then the whole trip was for nothing... wasn't it?
I'm not going out there.
I know that.
Not any more!
That's where my father was killed.
Yes.  It was a black day.  One of my disciple's took the crystal and became a Sith Lord.  It was a black day.  The few crystals that remain are in the possession of the Sith Lords on Alderaan.  That's how they've become so powerful.
The academy is fantastic... Of course, they won't teach you anything about flying you don't already know.  Most of the instructors are very conservative pilots.  You can fly circles around them... but there is a lot on the scientific side that is down-right amazing, and you get a lot of discipline... but after you graduate, don't join the star force -- go free-lance.  It's the only way to get into the action... I can't wait until my hitch is up.
I've got it blocked.  I'm all right.
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
It could be worse...
I have little time for your mercenary concerns, but I am grateful for the service you have given to our cause.  What is your price?
Why didn't you say so before.
I think I did.
Move out of the way!
Come back here... Where are you going?
Your father's dead.  Don't ever forget who's taking care of you, giving you food, giving you shelter, and giving you the allowance in the first place. If you plan to work at the academy the way you work around here, you won't last very long.  I don't want another word.  Finish your dinner, then finish cleaning those 'droids.'
Several, I think.  There is not much to tell.  I'm not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling stories, not at making them interesting anyway...
You rich kids... are all the same !
He was our teacher... He was great.
Not enough, I guess.
Then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
Sir, I needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... I... I wanted to win, sir.
Don't have to... Some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision, I think I'd make a pretty good pilot. I've good great reflexes. You need that for maneuvering, you know.
I don't know. It's my last night as acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.
Don't mess with the boss. So what'd the captain say ?
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
So ?
Hey, bugs don't take prisoners.
I don't even know if you're my girl.
Shhh ! Don't make him feel worse.
Who cares ! The Federation'll give me everything I need for the next two years, right ?
What do you think ? Everyone did it when we got our wings. You don't like it, do you ?
What happened to your eye ?
We've gotta go get her !
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On one, got it ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
My job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you're walking me into a trap-
Sir, thank you, sir !
I hope so. I hope you don't ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
You can never be sure.
Nah, I figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it's too late... Gimmee the nuke.
SHUT UP, SIR ! We need pick up now !
You may proceede.
When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns.
I'm replacing you as Captain of the Enterprise.
Sir, the Enterprise redesign increases phaser power by channeling it through the main engines. When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off.
Unidentified small object has been pulled into the wormhole with us, Captain! Directly ahead...!
No.
My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties?
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Maneuvering thrusters, sir.
Hold station.
Adjust parallel course, Navigator. Bring us in to one hundred kilometers distance.
Viewer ahead, sir.
Thrusters ahead, one third.
Thrusters at station keeping...
Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal!
Sit down, please.
Mr. Decker... ?
Delay that order, Scotty...! Disengage all main drive systems!
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
High mag, Mr. Sulu!
I prefer your poet Dante's phrase -- 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.'
I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour!
Confirm, Captain. Lunar beacons indicate Intruder on a course into Earth orbit...
I'll walk you home, you can have my coat.
Sure plan to.
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new.  Better than new.  It has some history.
It's about life.
Yes.
...I always thought so...
...oh...oh.  Well.  That's very important.
I thought you had Play Practice.
What?
Fix my glasses.
Better idea...
One moment.
The other side.
You, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
Because I'd met someone else.
So is our electoral process.  But we still vote.
What's the scene...
I hurt you?
That's right...
Is it...
Gosh, you look nice.
It does?
You know what else a man can do?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
Yes...
To print the newspaper.  And I'd come to <u>write</u>.  To write.  To write.  Right here in the office.
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
I'm going to tell the truth.
If I go to jail...?
Morning, darling.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
Where have you been, we had a date for <u>three</u>...where have you <u>been</u>...?
Who is this person that you've found?
And I need a drink.
Waterford, Vermont.  Where is it?  <u>That's</u> where it is...
She wasn't in the...
I <u>know</u> my lines...
How old are you?
We've got three days to...
What I...
Everybody needs a hob...
I've always seen that.
I just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
Who is it raped you?
I feel so <u>close</u> to you...
How many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
Who are these from?
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I, uh...  I've always thought so...  Well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I've written a letter to the studio and to SAG protesting...  Bill: get a copy of that letter...!  I just wanted to tell you that I am <u>past</u> chagrined, I'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
...I know, I'm so...because I said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  Please don't go.  Please don't go.  What can I do but beseech you...?  Trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  When...?
He treated me as if I were a child...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Put something in his room.  What does he like?
Yes.
I, uh...I'm leaving.
Now:  the Waterford Merchant's Association, of who I am Council...
Half a buck I'd put him in jail...
The writer.
Some, you were, you were going to make a reservation for us?  Where's my schedule? Where are we <u>booked</u> tonight?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I was in New Hampshire.  I was at the Old Location.
You built an Old Mill in New Hampshire...
Did my matzohs come?  Get some for everybody.  Thank you.  Lemme tell you about my first movie...
And my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
For what cause?
...would you excuse me, please...
...the house, the 1835.  The original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
It's lovely.
How was your flight?
What's in all the bags?
I'm gonna' bring it off.
I don't got the money.
We got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
<u>Whatever</u> you need.  The City Council, of course, has to pass on your...
Yes, I hear it.
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you <u>are</u> in the purple family.
Thank you.  Those were all words.  I hate the planet Uranus.  <u>Terrible</u> name for a planet.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  You wind up looking like...
Or blush.  You look pale.
I bet.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
She is but an arriviste.
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
Mom?  What's wrong?
No, that never solves anything.  You talk like the big girl you are.  About what you feel.  And how he's hurt you. You know?  You tell the truth.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
Hold lunch!
That doesn't bother me.
No.  I think it's ugly.
Ice cold water.
There you are!
Cos she loves <u>you</u>.  She wanted you to have a daddy to love.  Even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
How could I be?  We learned some magic...
If you want me to hate her I will.
Is that like Luigi's?
Do me a favor?  Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
That's Rache's song!
Before you.
How do you know?
Oh.
At first.  Then, after awhile, some chemo.
Look, I will <u>send</u> a P.A. to pick up the children.  There are <u>agencies</u> that supply sitters, nannies...
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
It's Wednesday night.  She's at my house.  I'll talk to her.
Me too.
Fine.  But I wanted to take the kids to work with me on Wednesday so I'll take Wednesday, and you can pick up that Thursday, Friday after soccer, and Saturday before riding.
Good...Well...Take care.
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  He could have been...
Jackie stop.  We promised we never go there.
And we all went through that together?
We're going to win this.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Look, I...
I need practice.
Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
You mean, after I'm dead?
That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy.
Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Don't be too sure.
Worked.  Like a charm.
That's not wh...
Oh please.
Uh.  You hate my guts?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
I didn't want to spoil our supper...
And it's <u>my</u> call.  I promised them water-skiing, instead o...
Rache, get out of th...
Imagine my relief.  So what's for dinner?
I needed some time away.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Let me put it this way.  Hell, no.
No, she threw you out.  What a difficult woman.
There are some rumors...
Like what?
He was in a concentration camp?
Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
I'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. Any suggestions?
Thank you.
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Poison gas.
But really, you never know.
For rape and murder.
Nothing, I guess…
Ready for tomorrow?
Patronizing fuck! If you had just been honest with me in the first place I wouldn't have read it. I knew it was shit. But - idiot! - I believed you!
Yeah?
Tired of this shit...
What are you doing here?
Well, now you have.
Uh huh.
That's good.
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
I hate reading.
OK.
Great!
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
That's good. So then what do you do now?
N-not yet. I'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. Geez, remember when we were teenagers?
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Three.
No, thanks.
No...Actually, I'm a documentary filmmaker?
Actually, there is some interest from the Sundance Channel.
Whoopee.
Sure…um…yeah, as soon as I have a screening I'll let you know.
Th-th-they'll kill one hostage every hour until it is--
What are you talking about?
They probably have guards on the roof--and they're gonna be firing at me--not you! ATKINS What makes you so sure?
Even better.
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
It's nothing to worry about.
We have a special forces squadron out of Thailand surrounding the compound as we speak.
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
Good.
If I don't get power up we are!
All right, Mister Ambassador!  But you must treat General "Buck" Schmuck with the respect due him.
I am sorry.  Sub-miniature photography is my hobby.  It's amazing what excellent en- largements you can make from the negative.
Our scientists calculated that the detonation of fifty of our biggest nuclear devices, jacketed in Cobalt-Thorium-G would enshroud the earth in a hundred years of lethal radio- activity from which no human life could escape. In ten months the Earth would be as dead as the Moon.
It is buried somewhere in the Grudd Mountains.
Bah!  All you wanted to do was spy in our country!
I know nothing of the sort!
You're absolutely right.  We wouldn't.  No sane nation ever would.  That's why it was designed to trigger itself automatically.
Then all you have to do is untrigger it.
Ah, but if we were able to untrigger it, that would be defeating its purpose.  All our enemies would have to do, would be to warn us in advance that they were going to violate one of our unalterable triggering conditions. We would bluff, naturally, but in the end we would be insane not to untrigger it. Now we can say: There is no point trying to intimidate us, we don't control the Doomsday Machine.
Why are you saying that phrase over and over again?
Get a grip on yourself, Major!
Don't worry, Major.  Your rights will be fully protected.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What is your name, young lady?
Well, sir, about forty-six minutes ago one of my base commanders, General Jack D. Ripper, sent out attack orders to the thirty-four B-90's of the 843rd Bomb Wing, under his command.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.  What's up, General Ripper?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
Are you questioning my orders, Major?
Sort of like a new hobby, huh, General?
Well, General Ripper, sir -- I was thinking -- we're on a condition red, aren't we?
That's a good question, Major.  Maybe if you think hard, you can think of the answer yourself.
And if that were true?
I know that, sir.
When he said it, fifty years ago, he might have been right.  But today, war is too important to be left to the politicians. Do you follow me, Major?
I know so, Major.  I know so.  And add to that, the whole Air Command force being committed to clobber everything they've got.
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
That's right, sir.  And don't forget in a few years a lot of other countries will have the bomb.  What if they start something?
Major, you're talking like one of them!
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Why can't you cancel it?
Then there's no chance for recall?
They're coming in now.
General Faceman, what was the name of the officer who called me from Burpelson?
Well, if you choose to take his word over mine ---
Mister President, there were thirty-four aircraft involved.  Thirty acknowledged the recall.  That makes four shot down.
What's the target.
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Between Mach 3 and 4.
They must have made a visual contact.
Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
What's your point, Lothar?
In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
They must have gotten it from the base. No one else would know it.
Our orders warn us to expect the enemy to use ingenuity in issuing contrary and confusing orders.  And therefore, to disregard anything that doesn't come on the CRM-114.
Take it easy, Major Kong.
But the code is made up by General Ripper, and he's the only one left at the base who would know the code.
Maybe the warning system's out.
But I get a red light.
I asked you a question, Lothar!
There's no other way, boys.  I'm going to have to take her in...the hard way.
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
In Group?
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
How long were you in there?
Typical male.
A cloud.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Yeah, a long while. A long, long while.
No, I'm not worried.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
She's dead.
God, Tim lied to your ass, man. That guy's sad, man. Well, uh, I gotta go, but, uh, listen, if I don't come back, I'll send a video of me surfing. Alright, man? Get some rest. Go with the flow.
Yeah.
Buff is funny. God.
I can come visit?
You owe me twenty cents. Come on, seven-twenty. Seven-twenty.
Yo! Your spitting rice all over us! God.
Please!
Look, look, I'm not joking around now, okay? Come on, let's go, let's go!
Yes I do. My family owns it. It's ours. You don't belong here.
Well, play it, man.
I didn't want to eat this much, man.
Come on. Inside.
He is.
And you love him a lot. He bought you a BMW for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. I mean, I know, it's time to leave the nest. Parents hate your smoking. You didn't tell them about the abortion. All your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. Subscribe to Vaniety Fair.
What'd he get you?
Mm.
Now, how the hell would you know what I think? Hm? You don't know me.
Well, I mean, you have to understand I was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. I mean, well, I enlisted right out of high school. So I just wanted something different in my life.
Well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, Erica, this is my friend Jeff.
Because I'm alienated.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
I'm a loser. And I'm drunk. But I'm not gutless.
No.
I don't know.
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
I know, I know, I know.
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Like what?
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
Like I'm going to pay twenty bucks to see Neil Moynihan in some band that I helped start.
Okay, but nothing happened. Believe me, if I thought something really bad was going to happen, I would've done something.
Mm-mm.
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
No, no.
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.
What?
No, I mean it. No, look, when, when I got out of the car I walked all the way here.
Oh, yeah?
God, you smell like whiskey.
Shit, Jeff!
Go.
What?
Yeah, hey I saw your album at Musicland up at the mall.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
The road's hell, you know? I mean airport, hotel, show. And airport, hotel, show. Airport, hotel, show. I mean, fuck, man, you know? You still living at your mom's?
Now?
No, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, I just stay at the Four Seasons. It's easier.
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Oh, shit. Jeff. Jeff, come up here!
Hey it's your roof. It's your fucking problem.  Hi, uh, there's an emergency down at the Circle A on first Street, Yeah, Okay.  You're fucked now, pal!  Um, send an ambulance 'cause I, I think it's an overdose or something. Okay. Okay.  Jeff, they're coming. Just wait here. I'm gonna go over to Scuff's and see if he's got his truck.  Listen, if she dies, you're gonna be so sorry that you ever showed your brown face in this town!
Oh, it's stupid, isn't it.
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
Yeah, and I was thinking, Sooze, you could do the cover.
You do not want me to do your cover.
I don't want you to do the cover, I, I need you to do the cover.
That's because I am.
Me?
Yeah, I have, I have, yeah.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
I think I gotta go.
Well, Dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
Missed it. Can I get a fifth of Old Crow?
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
You know the fuck not.
You just became a statistic!
Conan went to Harvard.
Better enjoy it now.  'Cause tomorrow some little kid falls down a well and we're nothing but a distant memory.
Hee-hee-haaaa-weee worked it out.  Heee hee-haaa....
Jus some girlie things for the squad.
Uh, "no"... You're not fat.
And if the O.J. trial taught us anything, it taught us that in America, you can cut off someone's head and still be found innocent if you have enough money.  Your mom only shot a guy...
Di, it's not your fault.  We all wanted to do this - for you... for ourselves.
She's been the weak tit on this mama cat since the beginning.
That you?
For a pack of cigs?  I use her food stamps.
Kim-Lo?
Ooops, that's me -- gotta run!
Oh yeah, you caught us...
She did, did she?  How is the old girl?
Maybe we can make a deal.
I'm only allowed "G" movies.
Hey, I even took my parents' foster kid money.  Phillipe's gonna have to gather rice without pants this month.
Gee, I'll sit out this afternoon's coffee talk.  Whaddya want?
What?!  Hush up, you mouthy little shit!
More proof God's a guy...
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
She got to be.  A dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  Hold everything.
Action! The scene starts.
I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons.  Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect.
I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky?
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
You'll be waiting for me?
You did?
I tell you this is half sold.
Sorry if I crossed you up.
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together.
We're engaged.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
You bet.
Whose?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
What assistant?
You know, crazy things happen in this business.  I hope you haven't lost your sense of humor ...
We've missed you too, dear.
Sure.  Wait a minute -- haven't I seen you -- ?
I am big.  It's the pictures that got small.
Get out!
Who else ?
I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Maybe it's a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you're not a professional writer.
I don't know.
What month?
Sagittarius.  I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
Maybe I'd better take the rest of the script home and read it -
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Unpack nothing.  I didn't say I was staying.
What scene?
Honestly, it's a little old hat. They don't want that any more.
I've lost my car.
Of course you do.  A tuxedo and tails.
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
Just follow me.
What's that?
"Mad about the boy."
Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
DeMille is Leo.  I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks.  Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around.  Let me dry you.
So he said it quite a few years ago.  So what?  I never looked better in my life.  Do you know why?  Because I've never been as happy in my life.
I think I'll read a little.
I went for a walk.
Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you.
No, they don't.
I'm the greatest star of them all.
No one leaves a star.  That makes one a star.
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
Naturally.  I brought them myself.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
He had a great big bungalow on wheels.  I had the upstairs.  See where it says 'Readers' Department'? I remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
And she's turned you into a servant.
You say the cutest things.
More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good.
Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Thank you, Max.
This is the staircase of the palace.
But where?
But what will happen?
Is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
Terrific.
It's paradise . We could be very happy here.
I'm not mad at you.
But what if---it wasn't real?
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
She has hostages.
Do you want to come to Argo City?
Well, there's several ways to go .
Oh, you know how parties are. Always some damage.
Supergirl?
That one was for you. But I thought I'd wait and see how you behave when Supergirl gets here. I'd hate to lose you, Ethan.
Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
It's no trouble. I'd like to ask you some more questions.
The scoop of the year!
Oh, sure.
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
I heard stories.  I don't think you wanna know.
It was my fault we lost the Power Source.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
I dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
You're going to pay a terrible price. The power of Shadow is tricky. Use it too much and it takes over.
I could teach you a thing or two now.
For what?
Your nightmares are over. I'm taking this back to Argo City where it won't be misused.  You could come too. It might be safer for you.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
I was on Earth...
Of course, my dear. What can I do?
Better than when I was a child.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Buddy, are we in trouble.
First the supplier couldn't find the invoice. Then the order came up short. Then I missed the four o'clock plane from Cleveland and had to rent a car, and then I got a darn flat tire on the highway! Can you beat it? Boy, your boss must've been furious when I didn't show up by the end of the day today, huh?
The kid needs a man to show him --
Clark.
Sure, Lana, I'd love to.
There must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
Mayonnaise? Donald loved mayonnaise. Why would you think that was the problem.?
No, the problem is --  Why do I stay in Smallville? Believe me, I've asked myself the same question. Do you know how lucky you are to live in Metropolis?  The Big Apricot.
That's easy to say. But how? And what about Ricky?
No, all the good ones are married. That's why Brad thinks he's God's gift to women. This woman anyway. He's single. He won't take no for an answer, but he's the only one who's asking. And he knows it.
Ride a thresher? Well, I don't know. Girls are trying just about everything now but --
Well, he's going to get the best home-cooked meal he's had in... in a long time. You tell Superman we think he's wonderful.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
What's that?
Yeah.
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
The only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! Well! That's some kind of record. Talk about fast!
So where is all them half-centses?
Yeah. A raise . .
Uh...
Now me, I was born rich. I've never worn the same pair of socks twice.
Decaffeinated too?
Columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee. 
A very wise man once said...I think it was Attila the Hun... "It's not enough that I succeed. Everyone else must fail."  And you are going to do it for me.
That what they call you?
The moon! Listen, man, when I was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for Christmas. My mama didn't have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
I told you it wasn't no jive.
Suit yourself, Gus.  Say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
Sister! I'm his sister!
And do what?
We've already met.
The picture's fine. That's the way she looks in real life.
Hey, don't expect me to save you. Because I don't do that anymore.
It isn't much, really, you see, there's this little boat. Well, not so little, really. And it's not going where it's supposed to go and...
Diet soda?
Hey, I know a lot of things!
Couldn't we just get a computer to do this?
Where's the handle?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Get a hold of yourself, Vera.  Nobody else ever will.
We already have a super-tanker.
I could have it all! Holy cats! All the oil! All the tankers! All the pumps! The gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! No heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
How? Shoot him? You know about him and bullets. Not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
What's wrong?
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
Say you love me.
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Dickens! The whole world's about to blow up and you're reading Dickens?!
No offense, Kent. You're good, but Lois is the best we've got.
You thought about me in a parka. That's sick, Lex. Really.
North!
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
Your heart, Miss Teschmacher? I never knew you had one.
Selfish! But they get a chance at happiness. Can't I have that chance?
Patience, Kal-El. You begin to sound like an Earthling. SUPERMAN Mother, you speak only of honor, of sacrifice, of responsibility --

What do you want?
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Me? I'm loaded with good! I mean I've never even used it.
Are you kidding? I knew it all the time. Did you see how they fell into our trap? Beautiful . . .
Put down Lex Luthor?
It will. Starting with your own.
I wish I knew. --  Oh, God.
And I'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
No, realistic. There's no magic in the world. Girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
Au contraire, mon ami! He owns all those sleazy tabloids and the Daily Planet!
Clark, it's Lois. This is the fourth message. I've left. . . Where are you ?
If my plan works, gentlemen, I'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
Gee guys, that's swell of you. But  . . . I've got another idea.
But what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  What good was my letter?
Less sensational papers go broke. I thought I taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
He was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
A toupee that flies?
Quiet! You'll make him self-conscious.
Lucky I brought my drums.
For dignity. My reputation is at stake. Just put it on.
What do you fear?
Why? Because I want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
No, no, listen. I escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of Superman.
Precisely. And then it came to me. My greatest ever plan. I made a deal with some minor league Bad Boys. Arms Dealers, Renegades Generals, You know the type. With you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
One of them should've been you.
Yes, Mr. Luthor. The XK101 can travel anywhere in the world undetected. It also has a sensory device built into it so that it can detect any obstacle in its path and avoid it. It just goes around it or over it.  The XK101 never quits! It will not stop until it reaches its pre-targeted target!
I've been on the job.
A hot story, huh?
No, Mom. You know I wouldn't break my promise.
I know.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
He may have a gun!
Lois, you should see what the inside of your lungs look like.
He grabbed me! He held me! He set me down gently! How could that be done with mirrors?
I don't know, Lois, but I do know a fraud when I hear one. This thing goes against all natural laws.
Of this...Superman.
Oh.
So it's six hundred feet below Park Avenue, It's still a Park Avenue address.
You'll be seeing stars in a minute, Miss Teschmacher. y'know?
When it gets to seventy-five below, stabilize it.
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Not exactly. But it's his kind of neighborhood.
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
He always shows up when somebody's in danger.
How come you get all the good stories, Lois?
Don't just stand there gapin' Jonathan. Can't you see he's cold?
We'll say he's a child to my cousin in North Dakota, and just now orphaned.  Poor thing.
Well, physiologically, he...	won't quite fit.
I guess I got carried away
No! You couldn't imagine -
How good it felt -
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Oh, God! I'm going to die!
Right on the first guess.
I didn't mean that in any pejorative way.
Is it true you're impervious to pain?
Very much.
Yessir. Just what you wanted.
It's a Twinkie, boss.
Maybe I should get help.
And what does he do again?
How is Mrs. Stephens?
We're...not together.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
Alison.
The Walkers have agreed.  The Ottos. Nicole Burnell's parents.  It's important to initiate proceedings right away.  Things get covered up. People lie.  That's why we have to begin our investigation quickly. Before the evidence disappears. That's why I'm out here tonight.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Okay.
Billy, please.  The children.
Okay, fine.  So...stay out of it.
Yes.
Yes.  What do you mean by 'hippies'?
From what?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
No.  I saw it on his face.
What do you mean?
Billy said that?
What other people?
Why would he be frightened?
I don't know.  But it was weird in terms of what happened next.  Sean was still watching his mother.
No.  A little sugar though.
We've only got honey.
I'll...take it straight.
I feel like a princess.
It's like a song.
Can I sit beside you on the bus tomorrow?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
I won't lie.
I object to that form of question. Note that.
And what was the weather like at this time?
Indian?
That's good.  Judges like adopted Indian boys.  Tell me more about the Ottos.
Sure, it you could find a towel in this bag.  I know my wife packed one in there...
Remember that time we were having the car washed and I started playing with the automatic window?  How old was I, Daddy?  Five or six?  I got absolutely soaked, remember?
News?
Okay.  I went to sell blood yesterday.  That's how it is.  I'm in this fucking city where my father is a hot shit lawyer, and I'm selling my blood.
What for?
Is there shrimp on it?
You've been retained?
Yes.
Was anyone waiting for the bus with you?
Was there anything unusual about the driver, Dolores Driscoll, or the bus that particular morning?
The speedometer.  And it was downhill there.
Yes.
Very slick.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Well, yes.  He's your lawyer too.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star.  Not like you used to tell me.  Remember, Daddy?  All the people that were going to discover me?  Where are they now?
Charlene's over at the Spread Eagle every other night.  Sleeps with whatever she can get her hands on. She'll go down for a pat on the head and a fistful of peanuts.
Waiter, the check.  This man is trying to hold a gun to my head!
You don't like it, do you.  I think she will accept, but I'm not sure. She may be too dependent on her brother.
I thought you might have a faint idea of how this item originated.
I guess you're right, but -
And with ten percent of his future, you're great, too, Frank.
I only had a few hours.
Looka, Sidney, you're my own sister's son, but where does that give you the right to call me a liar?
Nuts!  I'm not here as an artist! I'm here as an average Joe, who happens to love your sister Susie!
Ten'll get you fifty you're playing hookey from a padded cell!
Did Sidney tell you about it?
History repeats itself.  Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
Yes, the Justice, that's right. But I think you had it in the column.
I remember ONCE when you didn't quite "put things together".  Boy! Was the Mayor mad!
Can I come in for a minute?
How?
Sure you can if you want to, and I know you'll want to...  By the way, what's your beef against little Sidney?
Can't hurt?  I had to get him back his job.
She knows now.
J.J., I swear to you on my mother's life, I won't do it.  If you gave me your COLUMN I wouldn't do a thing like that...
- He's got them on him.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
I've been up to here.  Listen, honey, tell me something.  You know Susan Hunsecker...?  Has she been in?  I mean lately, in the last coupla days...?
No.  That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
Can you be there by two-thirty?
Yeah!
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What kind of an act is this?
I beg your pardon!  I turn myself inside out to help you and now I'm a heavy.  Here's your shoe, there's your coat, that's the door!
This sort of thing!
But...
May I rent you out as an adding machine.
Pay the rent.  Let the tailor wait.
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
No.  You think I'm a hero.  I'm no hero.  I'm nice to people where it pays me to be.  I gotta do it too much on the outside, so don't expect me to kow-tow in my own office.  I'm in a bind right now with Hunsecker so --  Every dog has his day!  Lock up and leave the key.
Take a top coat.
I know you do, Sidney.
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
According to you, yeah.  Dallas, your mouth is as big as a basket and twice as empty!  I don't like you, comma, but neither do I go along with this column saying you smoke marijuana and belong with the Reds.  Also, since we're talking repulsive, J.J. won't like this for two cents!  Don't give me that look, Dallas - J.J. believes in fair play.  And secondly, this could splatter his sister with rotten egg by implication - your her boyfriend!
- and I just had to drop by and tell you how great I thought you were.
What do you do for that hundred a week.  Fall out of bed?
Joan, call a cop!  We'll arrest this kid for larceny!
But he isn't going to like this, Susie.  And he makes you nervous, not me.  No, I take that back - he makes me nervous, too.  But I wouldn't give him a second thought if not for you.
And on Monday, I'll take it off and stroke your light brown hair and -
Steve, stop it please...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You need a break.  You'll see it clear when you come back.
What chip?
NO!! We're going all the way!  You got that, Dyson?
I'm a cybernetic organism.  Living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
You just can't, okay?  Trust me on this.
No problemo.
It is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
Here.  I wish I coulda met my real dad.
I don't care.  We've gotta stop her.
Yeah, she's a total loser.  C'mon, let's check out the 7-Eleven, whatya say?
I don't trust it!  These things are hard to kill, John, believe me, I know.  We may never have this opportunity again.
Go!  I'll finish here.
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
And what it that?
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
So do you.
Doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
No.
In a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
Uh huh, great.  Then those fat fucks in Washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
I want to know everything.  What he looks like. Where he lives.  Everything.
You think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  Everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
I guess it's possible.
They're trying to sort out some of the works of art the Nazis stole from occupied territories. Who really owns what? That's Colonel Dymshitz, on the far side.
When you question him again, could you treat him with more respect?
I can't do this. It's not right.
What they do in Austria doesn't interest me one little bit. Okay? I have your questionnaire here,  Gustav Heinrich Ernst Martin Wilhelm Furtwängler, born Berlin, January 1886. Orchestral conductor. And you say here you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
Well, there was a constant battle between Goering and Goebbels as to which of them would control German culture. I was simply a pawn. Anyway, I resigned from the Musikkammer at the same time I resigned as Musical Director of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1934.
Sure.
When will my case be heard by the Tribunal?
Tough, tough!
Oh boy, you're gonna love this. Take your time with this now. Those files contain the details of every working artist in this country. Those files are gonna tell us who joined the Party, who informed and who was helpful.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
And what did he say?
This is absolute nonsense!
What?
I believe that. But just answer the question, don't give me explanations.
Speaking to Party members I used their language, of course I did, everyone did.
I love my country, I believe in music, what was I to do?
The one he kept in his right hand. Yes, you remember.
One-zero-four-nine-three-three- one. Or d'you mind if I just call you 'one'?
I don't know what you mean, Major.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
That guy's a jerk.  I did you a favor.
Alright, the beige one.
Listen.  Understand.  That Terminator is out there.  It can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Until you are dead.
Kyle.
Just talk.  Tell me about my son.  Is he tall?
You volunteered?
Come on, me? The mother of the future?  Am I tough? Organized?  I can't even balance my checkbook.  I cry when I see a cat that's been run over... and I don't even like cats.
And anyway, what do I know about guerrilla warfare?
You like it?  It's my first.
Listen.  Understand.  I'm not a military objective, Reese.  I'm a person... You don't own me.
Later.  I'm going out for materiel.  Keep this.
Hot dogs?
I want it to be over for me too. I feel like I slipped over some invisible line, that I'm in your world now.  Everything's the same, but I see it differently. It's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
Probably.  Sarah, if I get zeroed...
Don't say that.
If I do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. Different country, different name, everything.  In case they send another one.
No.  Never.
Oh, Kyle.
You'll beg for mercy in a second.
The year 2027?
Why?
Surrounded by living tissue.
Then why am I talking to you? Get out.
Who is in authority here?
Yes, but I don't want to leave.  I think this guy's following me.
I guess so.  You're a doctor?
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
I know.
Call her.
Like shit, boss.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
There is no Baer/Grant Publishing without Alan Baer.
Hm?  No, about a year ago.  I was working out of Los Angeles.
I, uh... haven't been to Sunday school in years...
Fine, Dennis.  Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'll be right with you.
It was an accident.
He's pissing his pants.  Is that real enough for you?  Call 911!
If there was one.
Please...
They'll love that.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Okay.
I thought...
God, wake up, it's a con!
They did the same to him as they did to you.
It might be best if we didn't talk.
It wasn't you.  It wasn't personal...
Call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  Tell them I'll kill you...
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
Big family... small?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
It's a profound life experience.
Okay.
What's this all about, Connie?
Yeah, almost...
How do you mean, exactly?
It doesn't stop, Nick.  I paid the bill, I gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  They won't leave me alone...
Everything.  I'm a goddamn human-pinata...
How do you know?
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
What?  Connie...
Yeah, yeah.  She called a cab. Said something about catching a plane.
Yes.
Have you gone to the police?
No, thank you.
Oh... it's a game.
No, I can't.  I'm sorry and all, but...
I don't want money.  I'm pulling back the curtain.  I'm here to meet the wizard.
Let's get you dried off first.  I might have some clothes below.
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Have we met?
The key?
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
I don't know what you're talking about.  What's happened?
No.  What happened... no one expected it.
Goodnight.  Where was she?
He couldn't, or refused to pay.  We extended credit...
The Fitzwilliam Botanical Garden Annual Fundraiser.
Nice touch.  Does the game use real bullets... ?
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
Nothing else?
And what kind of sleeper?
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Sure.
I've read your tests.
No.
The whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  Like he says it's about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that'd be a legitimate study, but I think that we've been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he's really looking at something else.
Mary, I'll meet you outside.
You don't believe in the paranormal.
No.
Theo I think.  You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
I don't know.
Why?
Then who called me?
You're going to publish, he's going to perish... And why did you hire me for this?
Yes.  It's perfect, isn't it?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
It's okay... we're all here...
So far.
Why would we --
It's all I could afford.
That depends.
The Taj Mahal wasn't a palace, it was a tomb.  Why didn't he tell us?
David.
Red.  What else?
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Come on!  Why are we waiting?
Gordon?  He's been with me for years. He's not as tough as he looks.
I'm so glad we're having this chat.
As soon as you get dressed.
Like you.
It's just fuel to me.  I'm not there for distractions.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. <u>The</u> sensual experience.
Who?
Not who, food.  Should we get Italian.
Sure.
Okay.
What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you.
Fuck you.
Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
What'd you call that -- the Protector?
Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home.
These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
How'd the two of you hook up, then?
Oh, Jenny was in my acting class.
Gate's open.  I had a butcher's at the house.
I thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
Again?
Same.
It was the bars, then.
Ashamed.
Learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  Show up the old man, you know.
Yeah, saw Eddie, yeah.  Me and him are muckers.
Based in London, but with international concerns.
I bet.
On what.  What makes you so certain.
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one.  SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely.
Who remembers.
Get seven years, did you?
Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
Black market during the war.
Won't he be looking for you about now?
Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
Fancy it?
Bloke told me.
Yeah, I guess you are.
That dude who works for Valentine.  He's the one sent those guys after you.  You know that.
Eh?
He'd already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  Didn't think he'd be so bold as to take all of it.
All of what?
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
Yeah.  Cheers, mate.
I had to, didn't I.  Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
Lemme break.
What?
I don't get it.
Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him?
Exercising my visitation rights.
Since when?
Sure you do.
Susan.
Is he here?
Who's looking for you?
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
Birdy, I've been doing a lot of thinking. There are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. Life has dealt me some bum cards...
Geez, Mr Crane.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
Ah, but that is just what I cannot teach. I cannot teach her to have a soul. Look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *Done* with the fingers, yes. But the music, she is inside. Inside, monsieur...
That right.
Do? Hell, nothing. Well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I'm looking for a silent partner. I've done the research, I've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I'm just looking for venture capital, friend. Disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--I want the dough; I don't take attendance.
And how do we share--
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Specialty store down in Sacramento.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Awkward?! Ann'd throw me out on my keister! Hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. I serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, Ed.
Would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
OK.
What kind of man *are* you?
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
I didn't say a word.
You don't have to tell them anything. We're getting you a lawyer.
...OK.
It was Big Dave's.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
How did you get into the store?
Will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
So, who should I--
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Huh?
Uh-huh.
Sure, go to the store. Go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn FISH, Ed...
OK.
...Nah.
Damn, I got a headache to beat the band.
Hello, Walter.
He said OK. Is that what he said?
No.
Pendergast may be in trouble.  Don't you understand?  He still hasn't come back.  It's been over three hours --
Get his gun and his walkie talkie, Jonathan.  Move.
I have to help Pendergast.  Kawakita and Jonathan stay with me.  The rest of you can go with Cuthbert!
If you like them, they're for sale. Another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
Oh Jesus...
What doors?
You said the system couldn't fail!
Whose footprints?
I drink.  After hours of course.  On duty, I smoke.  Do you mind?
Did you read about a boat that washed up outside of New Orleans about four months ago?  Twelve bodies on board.
Who didn't?  Big news.  Out of Brazil, wasn't it?
No.  There's more.  There were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
I believed them.
No.  I think what we've got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he's a monster.
You've been holding out on me Pendergast.  You have a suspect capable of this?
This on top of the scratches... isn't it proof!
Got my hands full here.
I know.
All right everybody, hold up!
I'd say we're in its home.
My work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard.  If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
Remember, it has poor eyesight.  It hunts with its sense of smell.  So for God's sake, Margo, don't get those fibers on your clothes!
They fill seven floors.  We have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  Just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  Not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  Only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
And failed.  These doors are solid steel.
Yes, I do.
Fourth floor, West wing, but stay with your class.
Let's ditch and find them ourselves.
They were yellow!
What?
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
Yes.  Whatever killed Beauregard may have lived on this plant.  When the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  The killer couldn't get them, so it got the next best thing.
Disappeared.  His body wasn't among the victims.
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.  He sent back a statue that's supposed to be an exact representation.  But I've never seen it.  It's in the exhibit.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
Where did you see it?
I didn't imagine it.  I know what I saw.  Are you sure there are enough men in there?
I'm in town on a case.  Dropped by to see Vince and we thought we'd see the new display.
Today.
You want to book the flight?
What have we missed?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Let's go to some of those viewers' calls.
Certainly a nomination.
Of course, his eagerness to leave his mother's womb also meant he was the one selected.
The Hague for Christof...The Hague?...lost them.  Hollywood, California, you're on "Tru Talk."
<i>You</i> were real.  That's what made you you so good to watch.
They removed all physical trace of her but they couldn't erase the memory.
The memory of who?
Because his mother got sick - very sick.  He couldn't leave her.  He's a kind boy, maybe too kind.
Oh, yes.
I'm Truman, Truman Burbank--
It's not that simple.  Takes money, planning.  You can't just up and go.  Oh, I'm going to do it, don't worry about that.  I've just got to move slow.  Pick my moment.  Bonus time's just around the corner.  Soon as I finish the...
Trust me.
Sorry, I'm way behind.
<i>Mixed up?</i>  Mixed up in what?
Just between you and me, Marlon, I'm going away for a while.
This is different.  Everybody seems to be in on it.
--I figure we could scrape together eight thousand.
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments.  Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
Fixing the mower.  I saw my father today.
How do you know?
What do I do?
--you're a nurse, aren't you?
I bet you did.
Well, I made it through another night.
I spend half my life out in the sun, Mother, why would I need vitamin D?
I'd ask for identification.
Yeah.
Does what?
Why don't you go home to the old lady --
I apologize for making you wait -- I've brought some new evidence with me --
Are you going to let us in on what exactly you're trying to prove --
Agent Mulder.
Well...where would you like me to start? Antarctica is a long way from Dallas, Agent Scully. I can't very well submit a report to the Attorney General that alleges the links you've made here. Bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
Most of what I find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. I realize you're very lucky to be alive Agent Scully. The ordeal you've endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the Justice Department. Until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
Yes.
Of what?
Heard you come here now and again. Figured you'd be needing a little drinky tonight.
You a reporter?
Who sent you?
For what? Because I'm a dangerous man. Because I know too much about the truth.
I don't either, but it sure sells books.
I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
What did it look like?
I just did. You're buying.
Nice try, Mulder.
Thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
All I told them was the truth.
There's really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  Maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
Why not? It's three AM.
And you're looking for?
How was it contracted?
No irrigation system. Somebody's covering their tracks.
Where would they be going?
It may be extraterrestrial.
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
Where are we?
That area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
They can patch you in through the switchboard.
-- if it looks bad, it's bad for the FBI --
Whoever they are -- this goes right back to Dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
What happened to Kurtzweil?
I do it all the time!
Okay.
What happened?
He might tell me about Julia.  The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  Who wants to be redeemed.
If you believe that.
Like hell "wait."
Carl, do you know?  Like on a map...
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
Good for them.
So you say.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
It doesn't matter...
That hoist, with the winch...
Yep.  And guess who they hired to seal up the place?
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  All they did was observe and report.  Nothing more.  But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  She understood. And the patient responded.  Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  He knew she cared.
I am.  I'm a pretty boring guy.
They think you did it.
His own doctor?
Whiskey.
Oh, we didn't make much sense. Drank too much. Once he tried...
Where is she?
We're both in it, Harry.
Let's not get into any more trouble.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
He told you, didn't he?
I shall be all right.
Entschuldigen sie. It was a terrible thing.
And my passport?
We loved each other, do you mean that?
No.
Two weeks ago.
They'll be returned, miss.
Well, I've got it when you want it, miss.
Fellow called Lime.
No.
Ever seen one?
I'm not interested in whether a racketeer like Lime was killed by his friends or by accident. The only important thing is that he's dead.
Calloway.
You're not locking her up?
Death is at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals.
Bring him in.
I can't. He disappeared...
Yes. Where were you when you saw him first?
No, no. Leave them for a while.
Never heard of him.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Excuse me, have you got tooth...
Don't try to be a policeman, old man.
Zwei zwartze.
Tension? KURTZ Suspense.
Here?
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
Vinkel...You've got quite a collection of er-collection.
Yes.
Hear the details.
What does he say?
Ah, er war gleich tot - I mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. Ein moment...Wart ein bissel...Wartein bissel. Fraulein Schmidt!
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
There is one problem.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Incredible.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
I don't, but...
Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that --
You want it to be an event.
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
How come so many of the books are in Spanish?
Are they still together?
Bigger and better.
I stole it. From a synagogue.
What assholes.
I told you, I'm good at this.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
Kaddish is the prayer for the dead.
Lina, come here!
Nothing.  Why are you doing this?  I thought God didn't exist.
I doubt it. How did you find out?
Who's Eichmann?!!?
I'm stealing it.
He's Jewish? Manzetti?
They used to. Today it's not an issue.
No, but deep down, beneath the "tolerance" they learn on television, nothing's changed. The very word makes their skin crawl.  It isn't even hate, really. It's more the way we feel when a rat runs across the floor. We want to step on it. Crush it. We don't even know why. It's a physical reaction. Everyone feels it.
It's the truth....
What about Mrs. Moebius and...?
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me?
It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist?
German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos...
Notice? Like what...?
Of course they're Jews.
Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
Do you know who you're fucking with here?
I thought you hated Torah.
I can't help what I think.
I was just talking. I -- look, I can't help what I think.
I want you to say kaddish for her. It's the only thing she asked from us....
Yes!
Balint?
We're already marginal. We are saying what no one else has the guts to say. Isn't that precisely our appeal?
Beth Shalom. Like you wanted.
You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that?
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS...
JTS...?
Are you an artist?
What's that?
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
"Do chickens give milk?"
No.
Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy.
So what?
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
But your man isn't quite a God!
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
In a lake.
Listen to her!  "That's what he's here for"!  He's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  First of all, I'm unbeatable.  Second, how old are you?
Yes...
Checking out the competition.
Because you'd laugh.
Why?
Eh?  Si!  Avanti!
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
Try speaking to me?
No.  All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
That's too easy!  Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "D'you know that French guy, Mayol?  He's supposed to be very good!  Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I'll see you there...
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
... You married?
People say that?
You're staying at the hotel?
Everything about what?
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it!  Look here!
No.  Thank you.  It's really beautiful.
Enzo, don't be angry.  I was lucky... that's all.
You say that because you have the title!
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
You jumped in?
You sure?
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Are you crazy?  I have no use for a woman!  Since my accident.
Well... here.
Liar!  Thief!  Torturer!  When you were an orphan I nursed you at my breast.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
... Sally?
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
They're paramedics.  They wait at 180 feet.
Those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  They dive with a Helium-oxygen mixture.  At that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
I'll have to talk to the driver.
What's your first move?
Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to?
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
Now we wait for Santa to make his next move.
You know my friend Maureen? Her son, the investment banker? He paid for her entire retirement in Boca Raton. What a mench he is. Instead of schleping to save Hanukkah, god forbid you should go back to business school and get an MBA. Maybe then you could send me to Boca, too.
Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos.
...I'm not finished yet, mom.
Not if I can help it. You got any information for me?
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good.
I can't understand that fancy talk.  You mean I'm a gold-digger? Sure, I'm a gold-digger -- why not?
Who's Carlos Dom-what's-his-name?
Nice fellow?
I don't know —-
No, sir. That girl in the cemetery? My cat didn't kill that girl. I told you cats don't go around looking for trouble. If that cat's alive, it's out in the country hiding under a bush, starving to death.
I'd like one of them to say it to you, Charlie. I'd like to have you hear his side of it his reasons. Want to hear them?
They're fools. Why don't they let Charlie How-Come hunt it alone. He's an Indian.
All men are fools. They like to make a big show -— shout and hunt --
You think be's pretty nice, don't you?
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
It doesn't know how to hunt its natural prey.
A hunch -- that's all I've got about this leopard thing. It's just a hunch, yet I feel it deep in the stomach. It was a man!
You, Charlie -- you know leopards. You might have had an old claw around somewhere, and perhaps a bit of hair from the cage -— eh?
No.
Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
Thanks, Sheriff.
It's not for me.  I'm literally and figuratively a tenderfoot.
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
On his back, I suppose.
No. I thought that might be just a little corny.  I want you to lead him in on a leash.
Look, Kicks, how long have we known each other?
Now look what you've done.
Yeah.
You remember the fellow this morning -- Galbraith. You've got time before the supper show.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
Maybe I want to feel badly.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Eloise doesn't own enough of anything to make a dent in your pay check, Kicks.
I know. What do you think I felt when you said, "don't be soft?"
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
I’m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother’s in trouble.
What... What are you talking about?
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother’s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he’d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
When did you get back?
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What’s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
...You-you spoke to him?
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Croissants.
Well, I’d sooner mug an old lady...
You...  Jesus Christ!
I’m sure I’ll find a way.
A criminal?
Thank you. But I think I’ll go to bed. It’s been a long day.
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
No... No...  I swear...
Finsbury Park. We’re in Finsbury Park.
Just me...  Martin’s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
I didn’t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy’s education.
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let’s go...
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Three o’clock.
We need a double-room and as I understand you’re here alone we’d be much obliged if you’d agree to move to a single room...
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
You must agree to be blindfolded...  Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - you’re the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
Yeah... But he didn’t beat the demons...  A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent’s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
I’m sure you would. But if I had one, I wouldn’t let you near it. Now you tuck back in and rest until you’re told otherwise.  And for what it’s worth, I wouldn’t try anything that might be construed as unappreciative of my hospitality. I’d sooner shoot you than have you upset me...
Cinq cents.
Où est passé ton salon?
What do you think, huh?
Huh. Maybe he figured the news our London bureau got a visit from a hitman on behalf of a pissed off client wouldn’t go down too well. He only shared his guilty secret last night. And then only ‘cause he was so fucking edgy after calling his hotel we persuaded him to talk.
Salut, Laurent. Ouais. It wasn’t easy but I got what you wanted through Interpol. Say, what’s your business with these Spitzes?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
I promise...
Jeanne, no...
You make it sound so simple...
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
Me?!  It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated!  If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place?  And why let this war go on for a hundred years?  And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  Why, why?!
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
It would not be the same without you.
I -- I don't understand...
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore...  You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
We have to press home the attack!
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
How can I calm down when I'm made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I've had enough!
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
Guess.
And God who allowed you to be caught?
The English??
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Not unless you hear my confession.
I assure you they do.  So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Last night.
No... I want to be confessed.
And your Duke?  The Duke of Bedford?
Buying her?
You're a fine judge of character, Charles.  It'll take you less than five minutes to expose her if she's a fake.  But if she's not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English.  You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
His face.
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
Good.  Where are the English?
Jeanne, you have to understand -- it's not easy for us -- I mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
We're taking back the Tourelles!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Not yet.
The English won't wait.
The Dauphin -- he's sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by Jeanne -- the maiden from Lorraine -- isn't it wonderful?!
Yes, it's a miracle.
Xaintrailles...!  Don't talk to me about miracles...  If I was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I'd be dead now. Anyway...
Oh, but I forgot!  It was a Sunday... that explains it.  God's day off.
Perfectly.
For weeks you've been asking for this... well now you have it!
Jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
No...
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Don't swear...
Won?!  Such a small word will never do!  This is victory, Jeanne, this is... glory!
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Why?  Are you waiting for someone else?
Because... I have to be alone!
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
No...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Whose were they?
Why did she have to die?
Only God knows the answer to that.
Jeanne... calm down...!  Calm down, Jeanne!
I want to be at one with Him now.
No one plays Chopin like you.
You'll have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
Funny time to say this.
I've no money.
A good place for what?  He's insane!
Just one. Dostoevsky. The Idiot. Three zlotys.
You're mad, that's your trouble, you're mad.
You'll be deported.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
But I want to help, I want to.
You're too well known, Wladek. And you know what? You musicians don't make good conspirators. You're too...too musical.
I treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
Bitch!
If you need help...
You made contact?
I've been worried sick.
Where are we going?
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
I'm not going anywhere.
Warsaw Radio. I was a technician. I saw you almost every day.
Sorry, I don't remember.
We're getting out.
Szpilman.
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
No sound at all?
There is something to be said for silence
Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears
No, no bible readers.
You have spare wife here Peini. You get rnana for that. Our chief four wives.
Nothing just yet
I don't want to learn.
No, words. You have never heard words?
I'm sorry, I can't do that.  I don't have the time.  Goodbye
Everyone has to practice.
It's my mother's piano.
It must come.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
You've missed this bit.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
Play a song then
Joliet badge, Snyder.  Don't cut much up here.
I'm lookin' for a guy on the lam from a counterfeiting rap.  Thought he mighta come in here.
I gotta!  Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em.  They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash.  I don't get it there I'm dead.
Here.
These guys have gotta be the quill, Duky.  We can't afford to rank the joint.
Good, have 'em down at Stenner's old Pool Hall before 3:00.  We're gonna run through the route tonight.
I think it's the best...
I'm out, Johnny.
Hell yes.  He does this every year. There's nothing to worry about.
We cleared 22 here.
We'll be waitin'.
Wasn't no problem a mine.
You could buy yourself some things. Clothes, or a nice car...
I'm busy, Floyd.
Mottola.
They workin' for anybody?
I'll take him anyway.
Neither are we.
What do ya mean?
No.
I thought I'd lost him.
You wanta wait for your share?
Nice work, J.J.
Aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Think nothin' of it.
You doin' anything tonight?
No.  What's wrong with the front?
I could have you put under this train for this, errand boy.
Maybe a couple million.
If I'm not there by quarter of, I'm not coming.
Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse.  All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony.  There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time.  We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
And you were gonna pay me back?
You got a system, Carver?
I didn't get the bet down in time.
Oh, Jesus.
Like hell.  You won't even get a review till you're seventy.  And if the board starts to go soft, we'll let ya out in the yard some night with a hard-nose young bull who'll put fifty slugs in your face and ask what you were doin' there later.
Only rents by the month.  Two hundred and fifty for the two of them.
Then just say he was sixty years old.
Is that what it means?
You've got to get your mind off this.
Go!
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
Go away!
Nothing.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
And I'll give then proof!
Yes.
How did you ever remember me?
I've got to see you alone!
Forgive me.  How are you?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
A new invention?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
He's all right.
She could tell you where father is.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'm asking you.
No.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
I think we're on the right track.
About three.
Did you go?
You don't think I had anything to do with it?
Sit down!  We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole.  Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
Why, you said...
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
I do wish you'd tell me where you're going.
Mimi?  ...  Oh, Dorothy's mother.  Does she have to be up to something?
Slim.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen...  What's the law doing to me?  Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
Why do you say that?
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
Who is she?
I wonder if they've --  I don't want to hear anything about it.
Maybe a drink would help you.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
He'll be here.  Give him time to get his trousers on.  Where's Asta?  Asta!  Asta!
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Well, didn't you?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
I don't know.
Your guess is as good as mine.
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Say you're the one who got me in this!
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Sure.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
Got a nice evening dress?
I wish you'd tell me who.
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  He realized that he and Julia could still collect money.  Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia.  He even telephoned Macaulay --  Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Yes.
Home!
Please, I beg of you.  The American army is there.  I am Iraqi.  They will kill me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
I'm thinking about when this war is over. Why you figure I'm here?  'Cause I got tired of being president of GM?  If a brother doesn't play ball, or deal drugs there aren't too many big money prospects around, and I'm not particularly interested in spending the rest of my life fighting the oil companies' wars. So I say if maybe there's something out there, what the hell, that's what I say.
We're going to keep driving.
Low on gas.  Got to refill.
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
We can't just go off and--
Weird they didn't chase us.
Get off him!
I out rank you, that's why.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that.  It doesn't change me respecting you.  And now you let me down.  I expected more from you, you know?  I really did.  I expected you to--
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
Blow me.
I did it!  I got the box open.
Everybody's got a job to do.  Figure it this way:  At least you get to go home alive.
Invest it.
I steady it out, they blow us out of the sand!
I'm just going to have a little sip, that's all.  Just a sip.
I heard it.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
It's the treasure, that's what it is.
Shut up and listen!
We're not going to do anything.
I don't see how that plan's any better.
We'll find our way.
Forget Wes.
We need something:  A flare, a signal mirror.
Sure.
What?  Yeah.
Okay.  Then we go this way.
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
Probably.
I just said I would.  I don't think I--
The...the gold...
It wasn't the gold.  It was the claymore mine.  The gold's in my pack.
Why do I have to lie in the road?
What?
Yes.  Yes.  That's exactly it.  Yes.
Okay.
Don't even try it.  You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
Yes!
Oh, no.
Yeah!  Gold!  How much?
You see that?  Right by us.  They went right by.  You had them Epps; you called it.
All last night he could have been--
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler.  That's why they wear them.
Stress category.
triple three, triple three! easy.....
You've seen enough.
Don't take anything.
We're leaving.
Look!
...and you're not lost now?
Who?  Me?...I don't know.
Where's LUH?
Save yourself....
There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
-Where?
We just got a bomb threat upstairs.
This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
Hey, look--
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
Then let's go see what they missed.
Then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
We've gotta be. In this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
Why do you do it?
One shuts it down, one turns arms it.
I guess I didn't realize how much I needed him. He kept me straight. It's been tough every second since.
Be right back.
It's from an IRA.
I was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
Let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. The guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
We've created a monster.
Alex-
We're moving' on. I have to pick up the supplies. Just two little boxes.
But sir--
Maybe she knows your old man.
We can't take the chance. Ring down to the Bomb Squad. I want them on alert.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Huh?
Someone who smokes French cigarettes.
In this crowd? It's gonna be Marlboros, Camels, and maybe a few Kools.
Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
I'll do it.
Goddamit, Reilly--
Report on the case so far.
Yes.
Very well, Jacques.
In a moment.
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
erect in sweater, arms folded.
I said, "Come in." And there he was. A fine-looking man with a moustache and long sideburns. He said, "Good evening. I'm the doctor." I said, "Doctor?" He said, "Yes, the doctor. I came to see about your tonsils."
Constantinople?
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Just dull.
Yes, Baron.
Thank you.
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
What do you mean?
Thank you!
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh, no, darling. There's <u>more</u> sex appeal coming on the first of the month.  It's only ten days ...  Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
No--not yet--but--  Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you. 
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
But, Lily--
Then you go into the foyer.
I remember.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh!
Do you realize I have light eyes?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
Then riding together.
No--yours, madame.
You would?
<u>Now</u>, <u>let</u> <u>me</u> <u>tell</u> <u>you</u>--
But I don't want to be a lady.
Please! 
Mariette!
Adolph J. Giron.
I know!
Please!  Thank you.
About what?
Right!
How much is your salary?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
There's no need for language, Mr. Hockley.  Go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
Can I bum a cigarette?
I always win, Jack. One way or another.  Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
We've struck ice.
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Yes, exactly!
She had beautiful hands.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
You're still my best girl, Cora.
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Now it's worse.
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
We'll find out.
Never let go.
If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.  And that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
You think she was really there?
Just tell us what you can --
How can you put this on my shoulders?
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
Montana?
Well, it'll have to be poker--but I'm so unlucky in that game.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh.  --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
Yes--
There's soft music--
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
Lose?--I won a little--
I thought you were a smart guy.
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
You take some awful chances.
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
Much better--thank you--
Why, you wouldn't quit when you're ahead, would you?
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
No--not quite.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing--  Bet I could find that bracelet--
Swell!
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
Yes!
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Somebody's got to do it--
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
What's he got that I haven't got?
Get that out of your trunk.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How."  Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
You've got a gun, haven't you, Chad? Will you let me have it?
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
You leave the kid alone.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Good night!
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
It all depends on what you're used to.
Well--get a move on yer--then get back to yer station.
Nice voice.
Absolutely nothing.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final.  I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me.  Good day.
But wait, you don't understand-
Here it come: one-two-
I was kidding about that.
Yes, I know.  You are a good woman.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
I see.  And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know.  Probably ignore her.
In vino veritas.
I don't know.  It all happened so Fast.  If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You know, Stephen Foster.  "Oh, Susanna".  "Camptown Races", Stephen-stinkin'-Foster!
Awful lot of money.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
I made a promise.
So're the Cowboys.  They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
Not so sure.  Somethin' tells me It gets harder from here in.  Should've held out for more money.
They know.  It's the scent.  We Better split 'em up.
Am I happy?  I don't know.  Happy As the next man, I guess.  I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all.  Am I Happy?  Are you happy?
Room service.
Wyatt...
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
You get lonely?
Oh, all right.
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
Really?  You sure?
If I had to explain it you Wouldn't understand.  Just say We're brothers to the bone.
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
I'll be damned...
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em.  Old Fred Wasn't up to it.  We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
Morg, use your head.
But she doted on the frowner
So to speak.
I know, I need a keeper.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
Business is business.  Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em.  Not If there's money in it.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
They're carrying guns in town.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor.  You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
- I'll be sure to acknowledge 007's 'assistance' in my report to the Prime Minister. But this is, still, a naval operation.
GET BOND OUT OF THERE.
I wonder if it runs in the family.
The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
I'm sorry.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell?
That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold.
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Shhhhh...
Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem?
I see...
I am not here, ol' buddy. The CIA has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left Hong Kong.
Who knows? Fog, night...
I didn't think so.
No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
Nice to run into you again.
No?
So charming! So suave!  Don't insult me. I'm not one of your 'little London girls' who falls for the lies.
- The family jewels?
Thank you.  "Now hear this: Drop dead."
He was my father's best friend!
He's killed closer.
Cleans dirt. Let's go.
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
If not?
Before we go any further here, Mr. Bond, from Lloyds of London, I just want to get two things straight.
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession.  Ten seconds. Are you leaving?
Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground.
And the 9:30 news meeting is waiting.
Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice.
- I told you! He was there! -
...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves.
What did your wife get her?
Junior spends time with his child.
How come you're not wearing my shoes?
My daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. Every summer, the way they kept me and Junior out of trouble was to send us to Big Daddy's farm. We would get up with the chickens. Every summer the fence had to be repaired. The barn needed a coat of paint. We had to pip all of Big Mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on Sunday. For Big Daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. Sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.
Will you still get the money from your father?
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
I don't need that kind of love. And I don't want to be reminded all the time that Big Mama's grandmother was born in slavery. If you really care about me, just tell me how I can make money.
It's like I've been swimming in muddy waters.
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
You probably heard the wind stirring up those dead leaves over there.
This would be a bad time for me to leave.
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
How is that hen doing? I was meaning to pip her before I fell sick.
Gal, you're talking to John Henry. When was I sick?
That's awful generous of you. I always ask to keep from wearing out welcome.
You ought to come hear our preacher. Remember old Cat Iron? Well, our preacher is just as strong.
You and Babe Brother hit it off so well.
Everyone has to follow his own plough. A man doesn't have to know how to cut a wick and clean a chimney nowadays. City people don't give a hoot and a holler about the shape of the moon nowadays. You don't plant old ways...  ... but, at the end, you find yourself doing what your father did but you have to have the land in you.  It's when you want to give the house or farm to the kids and they don't want it. You sell it to a stranger. You worked your whole life, for what?  I doubt if people nowadays have knowledge of a victory garden or seen an inch worm. All what we've experienced has no meaning.
Tolerable well.
Of course not. Have you ever heard of a man jumping in the river to save five hundred drowning people? No you ain't.  You have to take just one and fatten him up. When you spread help too thin, you , you just nickel and dime the situation. If you try to save all, all die but if you save one life, life goes on. You just have to remember, medicine that works leaves a bitter taste.
Some people grow up and change their ways.
That is a boy from home, Lulla's brother.
I already have, my dear.
Oh, I'm more modern in my ways. I don't believe in sin, though there is good and evil.  And evil is a thing you work at.
What's a toby?
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
If it was left up to me, I would poison him.
When did you talk to Harry?
Harry is the kind of guy you would love to take out in the woods and leave under a rock.
Yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
Yeah -- when you're sixteen.
See?  Now, what did I tell you? Right where you left them.
It's a long story, Bo.  I'll explain later.  Here, catch this!
Sheriff, this is no time to panic.
Uh-huh.  And when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
Hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
Back!  Back, you savages!  Back!
One minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down Darjeeling with Marie Antoinette and her little sisters.
Woody!  The rocket!
You did it!  Next stop.  Andy.
I dunno.
Oh, ya big lizard!  Now we'll never know what it is!
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Alright!  That's it!
I was close to being scared that time.
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
It's a big one...It's a...it's a boardgame!  Repeat!  Battleship -- Battleship, the boardgame!
Andy's coming, everybody!  Back to your places.  Hurry!
Sid!!!
That's right.  Your toys.
Oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
Not now, Slink.  I've got some bad news.
Bad news?!
See?  It is Buzz.  Now give back the lights, Potato Head.
Slink!  Hang on!
There's not.
It's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
Well ... yes. All right. But -
Finn -
Can you move over a wee bit?
It was only a mouthful!
I wanted my Leda to be a little girl. Leda and the swan. See?
Like I said, open container, P.I., Misdemeanor possession.  Easy to make it disappear.  For you, poof, it's gone.
I don't know what you mean.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
How much?
You will believe me, because it's true.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
That's a very apt analogy, Helena. Now, go home and be with your children.
You're gonna get through it, but the first thing we do is get Michael Adler to represent Carl.  We get Adler and we beat this thing.
Please.  Tell me who Carl sells to.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Look, I'm as worried as you are --
So's the video camera.
She'll be at a pawn shop in an hour.
Just watching you.
I got that.  How was your day?
Will we get invited to the White House?
I don't know.
It's a presidential appointment so... until I quit or get fired.
Parents still together?
Yes.
Then here's a little bump.
It's a funny fuckin' joke and it's quick.  Why do women wear makeup and perfume?
You want to make a wager on this?
Especially Tiger Woods.  ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
The amount of coke we got on you means capital punishment in some states.
You only got to me because you were tipped off by the Juarez Cartel, who's trying to break into Tijuana. You're helping them.  You work for a drug dealer too, Monty.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Fine, then we don't have deal.
Perhaps... Perhaps... I'm afraid I must first ask you to pass a test. I asked the same of your husband and he succeeded with flying colors.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
We keep our mouths shut.
So... maybe you tell me about your informants in our operations.
Javier Rodriguez.
If I can.
But will he be house-trained?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
Noriega is a criminal.
If I ever return to the bench, Counselor Adler, I hope I have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.
Right.  But, that's not the biggest problem.  One of our Intel officers picked up information from DEA that traffickers have come up with a process, a chemical process, to turn coke into something else.  It doesn't smell like coke.  It doesn't look like coke.  And what's worse, it doesn't react to field test.  It could be anything.  Maybe it's already happening.  I mean, how would we know?
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
I want your money, I'll take your money.
Just tell me where she is.
I don't know what to say.
I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death.
Apparently not.  Look, it's a shit storm here right now.  When are you coming back?  I don't know what to tell people any more.
I don't know.  I don't think there's any one person.  See the problem is the Juarez cartel owns everything and everybody, all the property on the Mexican side, sometimes all the property on both sides.  Warehouses, transportation, even tunnels.  It's very organized.
It's fucking boring after a while without the cards.
Christ.
Not sorry enough for being a fat cunt.
Shut up.
Because it's illegal.
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
No.
Smells like it.
Iggy Pop is not dead. He toured last year. Tommy went to see him.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
Happy birthday.
No, toxoplasmosis. Sort of like a stroke.
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Returned it? Where? To the video shop, Tommy? To the fucking video store? So every punter in Edinburgh is jerking off to our video? God, Tommy, I feel sick.
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
The pleasure was mine. Best interview I've ever been to. Thanks.
No, I'm clean.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Would not say no, would not say no.
Eh - Ian Fleming?
You don't know, do you?
That means fuck all. The sympathy vote.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Well, this guy I've met runs a hotel. Brother. Loads of contacts. Does a nice little sideline in punting British passports to foreigners. Get you a good price.
Why would I want to sell my passport?
Four Grand.
But you don't have the money?
We're two thousand short.
The Sick Boy method.
As you wish.
Sure.
You'll have to send us a postcard.
Such as sitting in a darkened room, watching videos, drinking, smoking dope and wanking. Does that answer your question?
It could. Yes.
Bring me the ship or I will destroy you!
The ship....
Rescued at last.
Let us explore it together.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Aye, Captain  How many times do I have to tell you? The right tool for the right job...
Head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. Then left at the blowscreen. You can't miss it.
I believe Dr McCoy is not in the best of moods.
What do you mean?
We don't have 1.2 hours.
Let me do something.
Look, the man may be a fellow Vulcan, but that doesn't...
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
That he's found it. Sha Ka Ree. The reason Sybok left Vulcan.
A "t."
To anyone within the sound of my voice: This is Captain James T. Kirk of the Federation Starship Enterprise. If you read me, acknowledge. Acknowledge.
You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
You can't expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the Great Barrier.
I'm afraid of nothing.

Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
Because somewhere... in one of those memories ... is the evidence. If I got in far enough, I could reconstruct it.
I mean I want both of us to go.
Boy, I sit up there grindin' away all day, and you guys are down here disintegrating things and having fun.
Oh, yes. The algorithms on cloud seeding...great piece of work. How's it going?
Ah. Sounds good. Well, we should have you running again in a couple of days, I hope.
Ok
No...
I can't afford to have an independent program monitoring me. Do you have any idea how many outside systems I've gone into? How many programs I've appropriated?
And I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week...
The Pentagon?
That MCP, you know, that's half the problem right --
Hmm. A difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.  Perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...
Really. You'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place -- and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
Then...
Look, you guys know how it is. You just keep doin' what it looks like you're supposed to, even if it seems crazy, and you hope to hell your User knows what's goin' on.
Well -- that's how it is for programs, yes, but --
Stranger and stranger...
Aah, I'm fine... little hung over is all...
We're inside a Recognizer...  You are crazy -- stealing a Recognizer --
Are you kidding? I think it's stealing us -
Another free program off line.  What's his User s'posed to do -- ?
You seem fine now.
You're going to stay in school. Do you understand?
Right.  She's only fourteen.
Nope.  The art buys are in a separate ledger.
Hi, I'm Harry Renquist.  I own a--
Okay.  Here she comes.
You want me to just hang-- ?
I still don't believe it.
Relax.  Helen still loves you. She just wants this guy to bang her.  It's nothing serious. You'll get used to it after a --
What're you talking about?  We have that.
What are you talking about?
Whatya talking?  I'm clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  Clean as a --
You know about that?
Why not?  You think I can afford a suite like that on my salary? Is Jean-Claude done yet?						*
You're welcome.
It's show time.  Don't look at					* the flash.  Do not look at the flash.
Oral hygiene?
You're damaged goods, lady.
Okay.
Well, maybe a little.
No.
Answer the question--
Yes.
It makes you tell the truth?
Harry... snap out of it!
What?
Do you still love me?
Yes.
No.  Much more.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Well, think of it as playing a role.  It's fantasy.  You have to work on their dreams.  Get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Uh... well, okay then.  You sound terrible.  I'll run out right now.  Just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  Sure, no problem.  Bye.
I understand.
Cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
You'll call me then?
Yes.  Now go.
No.  He checked out okay--
How?
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
Wait a minute -
You can't have just one.
The letter he sent.
Thanks a lot.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
That rhymes.
Heard that.
Nigger, back off, you ain't beatin' shit. Now what would you do.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
I don't blame you.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
No thanks.
Get the fuck outta here!
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
Now tell him goodbye.
Good for you.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
What department?
I guess so. Follow me.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I can, but I don't.
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Do you still have friends on the force?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
Do tell. Why drug related?
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
Are you still working security for Foster & Langley?
Uh-huh.
Dirty cops. We'll have to bring in internal affairs on this.
Or a supporting actor -
You ain't seen nothin' like these rock whores. They ass be young man. They got that fine young pussy. Bitches want the rock they be a freak for you. They give you hips, lips, and fingertips.
Naw. It don't feel too good but it's alright.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
I tell Jayne Kennedy, "Suck my dick or I'll beat your ass!"
Just put it in your purse.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
You're right. It is.
No.
Uh, what?
You don't want to jeopardize that reduction, do you, Cole?  Have it taken away?
And it appeared sequentially after that in...?
Underground.
1995 is the future, James.  This is 1989.
A secret army.  The Army of The Twelve Monkeys.  I've told you about them. They spread the virus.  That's why we have to get to Philadelphia.  I have to find them -- it's my assignment.
I got shot.  Look -- there's a gas station up ahead.
Shot!  Who shot you?
It would be great if I'm crazy.  If I'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay.  I'll never have to live underground.
Shh -- don't talk.  Hold still.
I was here...as a kid.  I think you were here, too.  But you...looked just like you look now.
James, if we're identified, they're going to send us someplace...but not to Key West!
I'm not crazy.
If you know how to escape, why don't you...?
Not, "what", babe!  When!
We'll get to the spider later, Mr. Cole.  Right now, we want to know everything that you saw.
I couldn't call!  You sent me to the wrong year!  It was 1989.
She knew about it, Jeffrey.  She knew you were going to try this.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Please tell me, Jeffrey, what exactly are you going to do?  I don't have to tell you I'm afraid.
I'll be right here...just in case.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
I said I was sorry.
Yeah, yeah.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
We all got plans.  I planned on seeing all my life.  I know you didn't plan on straying into town.
I'll bet my watch against your pay.
It is not.
No it won't.  You just don't know shit about statistics.
Where to?
But, in particular?
One way, or round trip?
Nope.  Darrell.
He's up at the Look Out.
Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery.
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
Time.
Yeah, right.  Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
Well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
That's about an hour and a half longer than I usually spend looking for parts.  You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices?
Yeah, you better remember that.
Yeah, I'll try.
'Cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her. The ring was all Carlos left her when he died.
What do you want?
Don't tell him anything.  He can't do this.
Sheriff Potter.
Who the hell is this!?
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
That a fact?
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to.
I didn't say it bothered me.
I guess it must.
Where'd you learn to do that?
Did you ever?
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Yeah.
Please.  I won't hang on you.  As soon as we get there you can dump me.  I don't care.  I just want to get out of here.
You think Jake's going to give me money just so I can take you out of here?
How much money has he got?
What are you talking about?
Are you sure?  About me, I mean?
There isn't!  There's nothing under here but more floor.  Jesus fucking Christ!  We killed a man for nothing but floor.
You're calling Jake stupid?  You!?
No.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
He can't prove anything, John.  He can't turn us in.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
Now we dump Jake, split the money, then you're on your own.
But you said we could be together.
<u>We</u> killed Jake.  And it's a big difference.  You kill an old man, that's one thing.  Nobody cares about an old man.  You kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. Never.
I think you're a lying, back stabbing bitch.  But it's nice to know you care.
Someone will find me.
At least I'll have company when I die.  Ain't that right, Jake?
For Christ's sake, John!  Throw me the keys!
Ah, I can smell it on you.
Mad like a dog in heat, I bet you were.  I can tell you got a temper on you.
Just ran into a little trouble.
Talk?  About what?
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
I did?
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
How much could you get?
Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead.  Well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
You think that's a lot of money?
Trouble with the car again?
I came for Grace.
Don't Jake me, boy!  It's a big house.  Odd that you would know your way, except maybe you've been in the bedroom before.  Maybe with Grace to keep you company.
It's not me you have to worry about. It's her.  She wants you dead, Jake. She wants you dead and she wants your money.
That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's cool.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl.  Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again.  Now go away.
You don't know the how, Mr. Vesci. And that's not the half of it.  I've got your money, and I go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
You're the gambler.  You tell me.
A hundred and . . . Now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  I don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  You owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and I want it.  I don't care how you get it, or where from, but I want it on my desk tomorrow, or I'll show you what real bad luck is.
Yeah.  What are you going to do? That Toby's a hot head.
Yep.  Tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. Nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
That's too bad.  I was hoping you were there.  Maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  Or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when Jamilla shot that biker.
Nope.  No problems up the road.
Eh?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I said I was sorry.
All right, old man.  Christ.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
What do you want for free?
All them miners last century. Hungry ghosts, killed off all the Indians. Up at the mine. Earth ran red with blood, think I'm fooling around here. White sky was on fire. Grown men cried like babies. I saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. They put me in the joint. Took my eyes. I cursed them. White people can't seem to stay away from Indians . You gotta watch where ya put your fingers. Pussy pussy pussy, Indian pussy.
I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
Mister, I'm calling you out.
Fine.  I was making time with your girl. Now I'm scared to death and I learned my lesson. Now can you go away?
Not before I settle with you, chickenshit!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
Bobby Cooper.
You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
Would I what?
I'm not rambling.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want?
How do you want it?
No!
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
What the hell are you talking about?
Damn.  Gonna be another hot one today. Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed. Course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  Then of course the clouds come in...
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Don't look like nothing.
Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
What?
I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two.
Open up!
Soda.  You got any soda?
No! No police.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
It's Grace.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You should be more careful.
No trouble at all, really.
That's all right.  I got it.
You're not from around here, are you?
Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
The same thing you do.
Still playing?
That's not an answer.  What is it you want?
They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
Is that why you're with him?
Walk away.
You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
Nothing.
Grace, I've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  You're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right?  Have you ever been to California?
...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here.
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is!
But I thought --
He was a <u>cop</u>, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
He was a scumbag!... He wanted <u>me</u>, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're <u>dead</u>...  You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared...
Sounds like it. I wish I could help Sheriff, but I just want to get my car and get on up the road.
Where to?
But, in particular?
No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
Oh?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
You haven't even looked at them once.
What did I say?
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
My turn. What's your favorite song?
Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
Was it serious?
Not money.  But I appreciate your healthy cynicism in the manner. It will be wise for both of us to proceed with greatest caution.
Is there a problem?
How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon?
But not a knife?
That's not what I witnessed David.
You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it.
He's kind of a miracle.
Consider him packed. I didn't like his attitude... Struttin around with a cane and shit.
Just now. They want you to come down to his school.
I think it's be better if I was alone.
What things?
Get mom.
Jeremy listen to what--
I believe comic books are based loosely on reality -- I believe there are real life equivalents of the heroes in those books that walk the earth -- I believe your husband is one of those individuals.
Why?
What you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  FUCK 'EM? FUCK 'EM A THOUSAND TIMES?  The kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. They won't just cut your face up a little.  STUPID CUNTS!
Ha. He was building his fucking porch.
Yeah, I guess.
Oh yeah.
No... but I guess he will soon enough. Had a Spencer rifle on him an' he was...
No?
Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me.  How do you like her?
Heard you done the roof yourself.
Uh, William... uh... Hendershot.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.
Did you... kill him?
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
A sign on him?
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
I could of... easy.
Oh.
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
He got the boy's horse.
What rocks? Why don't you shoot? What's goin' on?
You still think he's in there?
Yeah.
Just SHOOT!
First one what?
Are you... Are you gonna... kill Little Bill?
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
Yeah?
Yeah, an' I could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
Well, she...
Eagle... he hated my guts. Bonaparte didn't like me none.
IS THAT YOU, KID?
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
Huh? Uh... yeah.
His head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
Listen, Bill, I'm gonna see what's takin' The Kid so long. Must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
Ned... Is that you, Ned?  Ned, I seen... death.
Two.
Tom? Only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to Sally an' say you was...
Naw, son, I didn't kill nobody.
Yeah?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
That was your idea, I wanted to...
I don't kill nobody without him. 
Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
Well, suppose he does?
That ain't what I mean.
You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.
I love you.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
If you'll just let me -
Three million?
Russian, I think. I don't know.
Mr. Redfoot knew nothing. Mr. Soze rarely                 t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. One cannot be betrayed if one has no people.
And I am sure you have a host of wild                   + theories to answer these questions.
Sure. And I appreciate that. And I want to help you, Agent Kujan. I like cops. I would have liked to have been a Fed myself but my C.P. was -
I just want to hear your story.
I don't think you do. But you say you saw Keaton die. I think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. I think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. My bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. You tell me he's dead, so be it. I want to make sure he's dead before I go back to New York.
Gee, thanks, Dave. Bang-up job so far. Extortion, coercion. You'll pardon me if I ask you to kiss my pucker. The same fuckers that rounded us up and sank us into this mess are telling me They'll bail me out? Fuck you. You think you can catch Keyser Soze? You think a guy like that comes this close to getting fingered and sticks his head out? If he comes up for anything, it will be to get rid of me.  After that, my guess is you'll never hear from him again.
This is totally irrelevant.
YOU KNOW. YOU'VE KNOWN THIS WHOLE FUCKING TIME. GIVE IT TO ME.
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I never heard of him.
His own people were selling him to a gang of Hungarians. Most likely the same Hungarians that Sate all but wiped out back in Turkey. The money wasn't there for dope. The Hungarians were going to buy the one guy that could finger Soze for them.
I said I never heard of him.
Edie.
NO.
You think he's..?
No provisions, nothing. My clients testimony for his immunity.
Mr. Kint will plead guilty to weapons possession.
Counselor, you're insulting me.
Good.    You ever been inside a hospital?
How good's your intelligence?
... that was a Dr. David Gruber's office ...
Mickey told him to call.  'He's some very hotshot surgeon at Mass. Commonwealth.  He wants to meet with you at seven tonight re testimony in the case of Deborah Ann Kaye.  You meet him at the hospital.'
Answer affirmatively.  Simply. Keep those answers to three words. You weren't `part of a group,' you were her anesthesiologist.  Isn't that right?
Tell me one?
She'd aspirated vomitus into her mask...
And what did your team do...
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
...almost nine minutes...  causing brain damage.
No.
I know of him.
...of Anesthesiology?
Uh-huh.  Still practice a lot of medicine?
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
And wasn't that an oath...?  These are your initials here:  K.C. When you signed this chart you took an oath.  No less important than that which you took today.   Isn't that right?   Isn't that right...?
I completely understand ...
What qualifies you as an expert in anesthetics?
Then you're saying there's no negligence, based on my question?
The Doctors were not negligent.
I...um...
...What difference would...
I.  Yes.  It is.
She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anaesthetic...the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
Her doctors murdered her.  They gave her the wrong anaesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.    Her doctors murdered her.
I don't owe them a goddamn thing.
You know, you're pushy, fella...
This is a complicated case, your Honor...
...things change.
And it seems to me, a fella's trying to come back, he'd take this settlement, and get a record for himself.    I myself would take it and run like a thief.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Let me talk to Mickey.
From the magazine?
How come you're calling me from...?
I changed my room at the Hotel.
What Hotel are you staying at?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
We, we...No...we just had a small reversal in the case... I have some, uh...I have some work to do...
No, no, I'm just...
You're going to stay here...?
I...do you want me to leave?
And what makes you so tough?
I have to talk to you.
I'm going to help her.
What?
I'm going to get laid.
I can't talk now.
It's locked.
Kathy Costello.  That's my maiden name.
I did.
A single hour.
Yes.
Yes, that's correct.
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
We, we were rather busy...
As I've said we had some more...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Huh.  And why is that?
You don't have to do it for a living.
How long have you been back?
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
She is not my wife.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
About three years.
I told you! Right here!
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Tomorrow night? Well --
I'll take care of you.
No.
Honest?
No, it's not right.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Wherever you'd like...
Can't you see?
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
No!
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
And she was the one who died. Not you.  The real wife.  You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
I don't know... Switzerland?
We'll find him.
You like it, too.
No.
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
Wander about.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
Where?
No!
Home?
Would you know the room?
Too late... there's something I must do...
You can't.
How long has she had the room?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window.  I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
More than you think.
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
I'm having one now.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Sorry, old man. Work.
Out. I've got things to do.
Oh?
By whom?
How?
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
I need a drink.
Why?!
Eat my ass!
I'm not getting a ticket.
What?
Just wait a second. Wait one second. Okay. What are you doing?
That is not an "option." There is no multiple choice here.
Yes sir, there sure is an option here. There are always options.
We can do this. We can get her out of here.
It's a marble floor, we can clean it up.
She's Asian. They don't have Jews in Asia.
They won't figure it out.
I got children. I've got a life.
No. I think it's fucked.
I know...
What happened? Oh my God...
It has to be done.
What.
I got a migraine like a little monkey kicking in the side of my skull, Mike Tyson with a fucking sledge hammer trying to crack...
And a house. Valued at 350 thousand.
She's here. She's just...Hold on a second.
The groom?
We can take her out to Red Rock. Find some quiet place...and put her in the ground.
Give me two more.
Nobody knows.
Negative. This is not what we have worked out in terms of presented behavior.
Boyd...What have we done?
What you just said. Say it again.
I just want to get married.
Suck my ass.
Take care of business.
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
Hold on a sec.  Lois, you sure you wouldn't rather do this in the morning?
I'm serious. I'm the serious one here. I'm the one making the play. I'm the Indian Runner. And I want my money.
New king.
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
Franco Harris has a flare for the dramatic. The former Pittsburgh Steeler running back, beat known for "The Immaculate Reception," his improbable sixty yard Ricochet Reception. I say Ricochet Reception has made a bold move on corporate America.  Harris has lead a group of investors in the purchase of the Park Sausage Company. By taking on the challenge of resurrecting Park's, Harris is engaged in the equivalent of a sudden death overtime.
He must take an open-field run to profitability through excessive debt large competitors and dwindling market share. Before the clock runs out.
We're not goosed.
Are we supposed to?
It's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... Some do some don't.
I think so.
I'm not playing around. I forgot.
I wouldn't know.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
I suppose Boyd is the creative force behind all this.
I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
With all my heart.
What kind of seats can we have?
You go down there.
We're leaving in three hours.
More than I ever imagined being able to love anyone ever.
Well I do.
Well you should.
Just a bit of organizing.
Yeah. Sure.
No way.
We're not canceling.
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
Yes.
The prostitute.
Like how?
You and Moore move the bodies and bury Boyd with them. In fact, put Moore in the ground too.
If you don't tie up all the loose ends it'll never be over.
Just insecurity. Nut crunching gut splinters.
Same alarm clock every morning, same two pops on the same snooze button...  Micheal Brenn. Yes...Yes...  Hold your horses. Okay. Got it. 6.321 at 17.28 for 6.6 at 9.256 out at 3432.343.  Same shower, towel, toothbrush, razor, hair gel. It's a fucking epidemic Fisher and you better start addressing it. You're getting married and I'm not going to candy-coat it. It just gets worse. It's an eighteen wheel cement mixer that will crush every bone in your body.
That's my point! You see Man...burning at his absolute. To see all the forces just come together, just right, you know, just in perfect harmony. That's what I'm driving at. You get me?
Yup.
Well I don't have that skill and if I had to guess I would say that in no way did she believe me.
That's a good one.
...regression of Modern Man to his most primitive, ape-like state...
The post-Vegas Man.
A mutant species.
Drum banging real times.
Then I'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
Are there many windows?
Enedina and Paco ...
That one.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
Was that difficult to get?
You have no feelings toward ...
Who is she?
Only because you want it.
Yes, it is.
How could anybody behave like that?
It's my fault. If I'd come to see you more often, if I'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
If everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
The fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
It's for wheat. We've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
That's good land.
No, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  Okay, let's get a move on!  When are you leaving?
Come on, miss. Just so the Virgin can be really pretty.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
That doesn't matter; I like it.
Kill him and I'll tell you. If I don't keep my word, you can kill me too. There are thousands of pesetas. Kill him, idiot!
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
What's he called?
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Come with me.
But, miss ...
He has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. Does that mean so little to you, Viridiana?
A suicide is horrible. I know. But you should have told me.
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
Hello.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
Yes, yes, I saw you!
Look, I feel bad about this, so I'm going to try to look into the programming of his Maestro teaching tool for you.  ) I've had one sitting around for years. Maybe I can learn something that you'll find useful.
You mean a nano—tech synthetic organism.
He would slaughter eight people sitting in a room, but not two prison guards?
You already have staked your reputation.  Mayor Bennett and I have been friends a long time. Since Grimes tried to kill him, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to come to the conclusion that Sid 6.7 might go after him, too.  Bennett's Re-Election Rally is tomorrow night and we already have enough trouble on our hands with one psychotic on the loose.  The fail-safe on—line, yet?
Don't give up, Parker. Not ever.
Sid 6.7 is now armed.
Until we know what new influences are affecting him, we can't be sure.
I don't set policy.  You have the key?
Call off the manhunt looking for me. I didn't kill the transport guards.
I understand... I understand perfectly.
Bastard...  Sheila, don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.
You're...such a wimp.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
As far as the public is concerned, it is. The reason you got fired, and I got my second demo into production, is I'm a lot smarter than you. I never give my best stuff away.
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
You didn't see the expression you had on your face when you pulled the trigger. But I did.  You kind of liked it, didn't you? That thrill of going over the edge again. Of taking out an innocent bystander or two, as long as you got the target...
What you need is a collar.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Sounds to me like a well—educated way of saying you have no idea what to do next.
Dammit, I hate sounding so clinical all the time. All I meant to say was I thought you were doing well, but then I...
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Authority still makes me nervous.
My guess is dead.
What can it hurt.
Listen to what I've ... listen to... does anybody know Morse Code?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
Indeed it is.
<u>Fuck</u> the world.  Try a ten A.M. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
When it broke, he said one word:  get me Ronnie Brean.
Front page.  Washington Post.  Tomorrow.
You gotta give me a day.  I need a day.  He's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  Get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  We got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. Issue is as a bulletin.  He's got some rare strain of...
I'm working on it.
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go to L.A.
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
...but...
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm <u>working</u> on it....
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
We'll be back tonight.
<u>I</u> think, here's what I think:  S'it gonna rain...? 
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>Yes</u>:  she is saying this in Albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  But because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her Aged and Sainted Mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her Traditional...
Brazen it through?  Brazen it <u>through</u>?  They're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
...those limp-dick ... <u>turncoat</u>... I <u>thought</u> they let us out of there too easy.....
I'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
And I think that the Security of the Country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  Gemme a Federal Judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
AS WE LOOK UP, WE SEE THE PRESIDENT BITING HIS LIP, AND CONTINUING WITH THE SPEECH.
Shoe, boy...?  You know, you were telling me you wanted Beans?  Remember, you were concerned about the Beans...?
Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather.
Nobody whose name you want me to say, Mr. Young, I promise you.
To preserve their Way of Life.
Well, I have, too.  Would you do it <u>again</u>...?  In't that why you're here?  I guess <u>so</u>.  N'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  Your "ability to fight a Two-ocean War" against who?  Sweden and <u>Togo</u>? Who you sitting here to Go To War Against?  That time has <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>passed</u>.  It's <u>over</u>.  The War of the Future is <u>Nuclear Terrorism</u>.  It is and it will be against a Small Group of Dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. And to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  You have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. Cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  N'you're gonna be out in the street.  And you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. But I got one for you:  you said, "Go to War to protect your Way of Life,"  well, Chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  Innit?  And if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up Oil Painting.  And there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours. 
Earn your money.  ...He's ill, the Plane is sick...
Touchdown, Andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
I'm here, Mr. Moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the Party.
Yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  How the hell, n'nu'n', I don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
I'm a Jew in Show Business.  Why come to me?
I'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
We remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  Y'know why.  Cause it's <u>show business</u>. That's why I'm here.  Naked girl, covered in Napalm. Five marines Raising the Flag, Mount Suribachi. Churchill, V for Victory, Y'remember the Picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  Gulf War?  Smart Bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>One Shot</u> of One Bomb.  The American people bought that war. M'I getting through to you?  War in the Balkans, don't mean nothing, till some G.I. flyer, went down, Eating Snakes for Ten days. N'then It's show business, Mister Moss.  That's why I'm here.
Why not?
"The Country Is At War." 
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
I gotta protect the Canadian Horder,
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
Mmm.
...that's right.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  Hold out til after you're married. That's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em Schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  Make them pay for him.  Make... that's right, the price is their vote. Now, we bring him home, the President announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, TA DA, here he is.  Have him say it like I wrote it, It'll be fine. Thanks.  Labor, five bucks an hour.  If you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  If you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
Whattaya gonna do when this is all over?
What am <u>I</u> gonna do?  I'm gonna "Fade Away."  What are you gonna do?
Getting off on the inaugural?  Gonna go...
The Albanian Campaign.
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
What <u>kind</u> of stuff?  Hello...?
How's our friend?
No, I'm fine... I got it together....
A proud tradition.
No, I don't think you can <u>do</u> that, Stanley...
Leave it flat, will you, Ben?
It's got to sound like an <u>acetate</u> recording, 1930.
Hold it a minute, Benny, we're going to tweak it a bit.  This may take a while.
No, he's back in Nashville.
Yes.
Jim Belushi...?
Yeah, good good good good good.  And They're <u>So</u> <u>Secret</u>...
...they... <u>you</u> know...
A beret.
...their Leopard Skin Berets....
...of kittens...
That's right, we'll take a nap.  We'll get you to Washington, we'll get you Back to your Buddies, and...
Sell it all.  What the hell, so I'll only make ten million.
It's a romantic and tragic drink.
Okay, sir. I'll discuss this with the broker and I'll get back to you. You're welcome.
Fox, you're making more problems than you are sales.
No, thank you. I knew the minute I laid eyes on you, you had what it takes Bud. Just keep it going.
Cheer up buddy buddy. You shook Gekko the Great's hand and you still got all your fingers. He's not the only elephant in the jungle.
Forget charts! We're not fund managers, Bud, churn 'em and burn 'em. I'm offering you the Knicks and chicks. God save you before you turn into poor Steeples over there.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Alright. Why so pissed?
Goddamn fare wars are murdering us. Had to lay off five guys. Nothing I could do. What is it... money?
Wait... next week's booked. Let me check with my girl and get back to you on Monday.
What if he asks where I got the money?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
It's a dog, what else you got, sport, besides connections at the airport?
Yeah... not bad for a City College boy. Bought my way into this club and now every one of these ivy league schmucks is sucking my kneecaps...I just got on the Board of the Zoological Society, cost me a million; that's the thing with WASPS -- they like animals but they can't stand people!
Wildman's in town. He just became an American citizen. Something big's about to go down. I want to know where he goes and who he sees. I want you, sport, to give me the missing half of the picture...
Don't expect to get it all, sport, you'll burn out. First rule of business is never get emotional about stock, clouds the judgment. Where do we stand?
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
You're walking between the raindrops kid. I expect Sir Larry is choking on his royal chamber pot by now.
...Gordon.
A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fox.
I'm sorry, this can't wait.
Buddy, it's not a question of enough. It's a zero sum game, sport. Somebody wins and somebody loses. Money itself isn't lost or made, it's simply transferred from one perception to another. Like magic. That painting cost $60,000 10 years ago. I could sell it today for $600,000. The illusion has become real. And the more real it becomes, the more desperately they want it. Capitalism at its finest.
Are you with me Buddy?
Dump it.
Break it.
And what do you want?
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Fear. The fear of being poor I guess, just like you, Darien... But that's all gonna change sweetheart. I'm catching the express...  ... and you're going along for the ride.
Talk about being bent over the sink of life and being dry humped. I handed it to him on a silver platter. I told my father and those people...
At least I wouldn't be pulling the trigger.
...how do you know? You wish...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
Old values. Buy.
Don't worry Sunshine. Bud and I had a little talk. We came to an understanding.  I want you to go back to him. Soothe him. Help keep his head straight. Okay?
I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment.
Doctor? Lawyer? CHINA Lawyer, Doctor, I don't care.
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Would you like a closer look?
Thank you
Too late for that sir.  Give my love to the misses.  Get those bastards!
I know what you mean.
I don't know.  I really like you and I think you're very attractive.
Come on.
Go away.
Hi there Sarah
Sell my soul?
Don't be facetious darling. Now drink your milk, you're late for college
But mom, I NEED THE CAFFINE - BADLY
I'll think about it.  Now run along darling.
Listen to me.  The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
So much.
Mine.  His.  We both...thought...
Your husband?
Yes.  I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
Do you have any idea who she is?
What do you think I should do?
Well, that's what we're here for.
Well, I don't think I've seen you since the reception at Dean Ackerman's last year.
Who's that?
When...when will she be back?
Um...yes.
Um...sure.
Yeah.
Well she wouldn't.  He left when she was twelve.  Never spoke about him after that.
It's like that.  Doesn't seem real.  No note.  Nothing.  Cops say she'll be back.  I just wanna know what happened.
This is...
I came in from my room...
Do we have to?
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
Well good.  So you're human.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
In the window.  Norman's at work.
No, you're not.  But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
Did I?
I was down in Adamant...
No.  She wanted me to know the truth.  Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
I know.
What is it?
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
Trust me, Claire.  You hear something... change the subject.  You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  You know what happened.  The rest is only details.  And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Three weeks.
Feur, I think.  Psych department.  Figures. They're all psychotic.
How is it?
I'm finished at three.  No.  Squash with Stan.
I'll be there.
Remember how we were?
That's...
Okay.  Okay.  I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Right.  And why is she here?  If he killed her, why doesn't she haunt him?
Oh.
...like it never even happened...
Well, that's a relief.
Norman...
The accident...?
No!  Not sweetheart, no.  I believe in what's happening.  I don't want to, but I do.  I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
I felt you...looking through me...
Yes.  The ghost.
Who?
STOP IT!
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
Claire...
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
Adamant.
Huh.
Don't think so.
You don't have to do that.
MADISON!
Two what...?
Rowan's mother died at childbirth. And she doesn't have. any family.
Then tell me.  Is it Lasher....
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
'He'...?
Now, lasher - it is our time.
It you harm Michael, I will let my anger loose.  And you will feel that. Do you understand...?
I LOVE him!
I LOVE MICHAEL.  MICHAEL!!
I don't know what you are!!!
Always loved you. Rowan.  Always...
What're you - a mindreader...?  Who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
Nope-  My father died before I was born. My mother died in childbirth.   El1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after I was born.
All I meant was -
Rowan...?
I am!   And so are you.  You thought you'd found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  Michael, if you don't want -
It's the next best thing to being there' - right...?
He can't hurt us, Michael.  It's us - our love.  He can't find a crack in it.  He can't find a way in.
Their what...?
A little wine...?
Lock the door.  Lock it
I don't know.
Nah - I had a shmuck of an uncle named Lucas.    Grayson.
It's not true.  You have to believe me.
That's not good enough.  Why not...?!
I just - hate it when they're - finished.
You can't just -
I like him.  He can stay.
Comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. MICHAEL seems to pull inside himself. Cool.  Aloof.
That would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
The one on the left - definitely...
Well I'm glad I'm not them - what are you doing here so late? Come to that, what the hell have you got that for?
All the time?
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Sure...
Yes, two please. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry, it's just that I really loved your book
I'm sorry?
I think I will pass...
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
Why should I feel sorry - they're dead.
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Nothing could be better...
I'm your landlady
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
What's this all about?
So have you seen hubby recently ELLEN?
That's Charlie.  My best friend. He's into beef analogies, partly because he's a butcher's son, and partly because, well, he's just into beef analogies. What can I say? He's also a photographer...
Were you always this sick?
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation.
Astronomical.
Cut it out, before you break something!
And like every hamburger guy knows, when you get your one big chance at the good life, you abuse every second of it until they figure out you don't belong there and kick your sorry ass out.
Be cool. Fake it if you have to.
This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies.
Our plane crashed. In the Grand Canyon. A big fiery explosion. We never made it to L.A. They needed dental records to identify us. And this place. This. Actually. Is. Heaven.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Of course, dumpling. Its very nice of Ted but...
I guess.
Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be?
Well, good. Every little bit helps.
Watch your tone, mister.
They're in the ignition, silly.
I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick.
I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car.
Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy."
Hmmm?
You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious.
Aside from the fact that Mom's eyes are nearly swollen shut from crying and Dad spends all his time under the car trying to fix stuff that isn't broken, things couldn't be better.
I didn't forget.
You ever look down on them again and call them "grocers" like it's a dirty word, and you'll be sucking your filet mignon through a straw for six to eight weeks. Got it?
It's so nice to have FRIENDS like you, Christy.
Come on, Julie. Don't screw up. You have some real talent.
The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted.
Amen to that.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
You think you're working with chimps here?
Charlie, at a will reading? What did I do to deserve this?
Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin.
Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin?
Our state has a zero tolerance policy for underage drinking.
The Supreme Sovereign of Sexuality.
It's really going to be strange going home in a couple of days.
Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything.
Aw, come on, kid. Throw me a bone. I'm your uncle for gosh sakes.
Bad news.
Eat a power bar.
I'd like that.
Was there ever any kind of investigation...
Take your time.
Was there penetration?  Did he put himself inside you?
Then what?
I'd like that.
Weren't you a little worried about her...?
Back to the land of grownups.
This is where she lives.  She wants to talk.  Beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  I busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at Camp Nine.
Lombardo's settlement?
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
Were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you didn't do what you could to stop it?
I mean something bad, Gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you didn't do anything, and then it happened.  I did that once.  I don't want to do it again.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us.  Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
Yes.
What about witnesses?
And what do they say?
And then what... he touched you?  Did you maybe flirt a little...
Are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
I miss Dad.
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly. He could have gone out and gotten a job. Christ, he could've found another rich woman... He never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
Where, the mall?
You know what it takes.
Hello.
You can tie whoever did it to Sandra Van Ryan...
About what?
Suzie, Suzie... This is me, Ray, you're talking to.  We both know you don't have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
Don't you see what this means?  You really think Sam and Kelly are gonna give you a third of the money?  You, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
No, no.  Look, I probably should have told you a little more, about the part I intended to play.  We'll go through it all again tonight.
Listen, Kelly skipped school.  Have you talked to her?
Shit. Here we go again.
"Gadget guy?"  While I may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, I am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
I'll work on it.
Then we've got our proof. Excellent.  And where do we find this fortunate scientist?
And if they've got Dr. Loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
Well... that, too.
Uh... how long ago was this?
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
Sure.  We have no idea what's going on.
It is?
It's not a guy...
It's a town!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Well, where I come from it kind of goes with the territory.  Texas.
Would that include me?
Nice to finally meet you, sir.
No, sir... just a businessman.
He had a pressing engagement.
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
For the moment.  But I fear not for long.  I'm of no use to him now.
You're not going to use it, are you?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
You managed alright.
Me?
You're strong enough.  But you're going to need courage, Willow.
Let me see it.
Why not?
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I love you.
He turned that monster into stone!
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Why.
Farmer.
Farmer!  I knew it!  You're a vic- tim, Willow.  Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
I hate this.
My help?  A great magician like you?  You don't need any help.
Yeah me.  King!  But she betrayed me.  She robbed me of my dream.
Who?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Are you scared?
No.
Burn it to a fine ash.
The limitless power of...
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Here.  Hold her.
She requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
I thought I was the English.
English, Yankee. It's the same. My name is Daniel. Daniel Hochstetler.  You look plain, Book.  Very plain.
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
I was wrong.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
Oh?  What happened to Hochstetler?
A real fireball.
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
No.  I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
That's your way, not mine.
Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him –
Yes.
Oh.
Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look...  Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
That is idle talk.
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
Lean on him.
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal.  He's got a gun, hasn't he?
You might have killed him!
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
Dorothy, please!  We're trying to count! Fifty-eight--
Oh, but Aunt Em, she hit him over the --
Now, Dorothy, dear, stop imagining things. You always get yourself into a fret over nothing.
I know, but we all got to work out our own problems, Henry.
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
You'll be hist...
Hickory!
Oh, please give me back my dog!
Well, I'm a little muddled.  The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East.  And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all...
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Professor Marvel never guesses -- he knows! Now, why are you running away?
Please, Professor, why can't we go along with you?
Her -- her name is Emily.
Emerald City? Why, that's a long and dangerous journey. And it might rain on the way.
What sort of an animal is that?
Oh, my! 
Oh.
Because I'm still scared!
Did they hurtcha?
Lion, darling -- I knew you'd come!
Well, why don't you use them?  When you come home, don't go by Miss Gulch's place.  Then Toto won't get in her garden, and you won't get in no trouble.  See?
Ohh!
Ohhh --
Did I scare you?
Where's Kansas?
Witch?  Huh!  I'm not afraid of a witch! I'm not afraid of anything --- except a lighted match.
Yes --- there.
Oh --
Well, we'd better hurry if we're going to see the Wizard!
Looks like we came a long way for nothing.
I -- I -- I -- I -- gotta get her outta there?
You don't neither --
What's she done?  I'm all but lame from the bite on my leg!
A heart --
Here, Tin Man -- help me.
It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you!  Help!
Oh - look out.
Come on, fellows!
Go on!
It makes you nervous?
Well, I --
But I still want one.
Oh!  Help me! The balloon's going up!
Doctor. Jones. Christmas Jones. No jokes, I’ve heard them all.
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
Here’s your imposter. He’s paid off the men on the plane outside.  They’re not taking the bomb to any Russian facility, they’re flying it wherever he tells them.
Makes her look even more innocent.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
...yes?...
It’s barely a scratch. The Dome broke my fall.
Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
‘That which does not kill me makes me stronger.’
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva?
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Partially, yes.
No.
You turned Renard.
As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
How appropriate.
Please.
What do you think?
No.  It is the beginning. The world will never be the same.
Please.
Well, sir . . . in a worst-case scenario . . . we'd assume that twenty-five percent of the Russian birds get through.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Wrong answers?
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Oh?  The CTU suspects a Libyan hit squad.
You mean Afghanistan?  It won't require my attention.  What I'm doing here is far more interesting.
Mm hmm.
Collect me?
It will happen, Laurie.  I've already seen it.  Neither of us can do anything to change it.
But you knew that I'd -- die.
Because --
Jon -- for God¹s sake, what do you see?
Good night.
Good.  Be careful, Daniel, don't let up your guard.  Look, I'm going to head south for a while -- hole up at Karnak until all this blows over.  You two would be welcome to join me.
Thanks for the offer, Adrian.  I'll let you know.
The missing scientists.
I¹m not.
Fine, but the Civil Terrorism Unit?  It's a fucking Gestapo!  Dirty tricks -- political assassinations --
I'd say you stalled out about forty years ago.  Nellie Lutcher -- Louis Jordan -- I've never even heard of these people.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
The costumes.  Am I right?
Yes you are.
That's because --
Long as we're on the subject of perverts . . .  I miss Rorschach.  Let's spring him.
Hey.  Hey.  If you don't mind, use the back stairs, all right?
What do you mean, frame-up?
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Anything for science, I guess.  Janey, there's something --
You're not "protecting" anyone.  These people's lives may depend on the answers you give.  These are all former associates of Dr. Manhattan --
What does this mean?  What does it --
That's right.  Your meal ticket's flown the coop.  That blue bastard has apparently left the planet.
I'll take a raincheck, Laurie.
Stay, Adrian.  I just -- every once in a while, I need to talk to someone human.  He doesn't think like we do.  He doesn't even feel what we feel.  I mean -- he even scares the research teams.
Maybe I'll do that.
CTU?  Jesus.  You don't think --
No.  I just hastened the inevitable.  He's been ready to blow for years.  I knew all it would take was a little push.  So I, uh . . . gave his friends and associates cancer.
Are we done now? You've got nothing on me. So if you ain't booking me, I'm walking.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
You want the cheap backstory? The runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? Gimme a break. You're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.
Yeah, I spy or I die.
Hey, one miracle at a time. They're on to me now, remember?
You ain't seen nothing yet.
Kinda funny, though, isn't it? We're not supposed to be making weapons like that anyway. Guess we shoulda played by the rules.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
My goodness, a word with four syllables. I should get some ice before your brain gets too hot.
Go to hell.
Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home.
Go to hell!
What are you talking about?
They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now.
I don't know what's going on anymore. I thought I was square with that dude. Now everybody's switching sides like it's the WWF.
A piece of shrapnel hit me.
I'm sick of that guy. Let's stop playing nice.
You can't talk to it?
Perhaps he is not all he says he is.
Viktor! Stay the course.
Is that supposed to be funny? I'm not laughing. I've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. And ar the last minute I get bumped by you, some reject from the Ozzfest.
It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
I thought that was in detail.
Alright, so I'll get more.
I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is.
I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand.
They came and found me. They said they'd kill me unless I help them. Plus they offer me a lot of money. No big deal. These things happen. Dump your gun on the floor.
Sorry, man, don't know what you're talking about.
He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you.
What's "Anarchy 99"?
It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me.
My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch.
Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
Its core?
So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Were you now?
Not interested.
He takes his work seriously.
He takes himself seriously.
I've seen a lot of rings.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
Treat you like a mutant?  We are not what you think.  Not all of us.
Tell it to the ones that did this to me.
I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
You mutant bastards...
A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
Enough for a test.
Yes, my dear, he is.
Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance.  The estate will provide for your journey.
Yes, don't worry.
I've trimmed the list to only our very closest friends...but it still comes to three thousand.
You're incorrigible!
Love me?
Yes, he's a little bit... tilted. Harmless, though.
No, of course not.  I just meant...
All right then!
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
Is it worth taking a chance?
Yes!... the laboratory.
I see.  And where is my grandfather's private library?
The old violinist -- you smashed his violin over your knee.
That's true!  But my grandfather, Victor was, after all, what we might politely refer to as... a cuckoo!
You are talking about the gibberish ravings of a lunatic mind.
Why isn't it Frodereck Fronkon steen?
You must be Igor.
What hump?
You didn't hear... nothing! Aren't there any lights in this place?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
How?
Yes.  Dr. H. Delbruck.
Was he any good???  He was the finest natural philosopher, internal medicine diagnostician and chemical therapist of this century.
Oh!  May I call you 'Master'?
All right... elevate me!
Yes!  When I give the word -- throw the first switch!
Throw the third switch!
I'm sorry.  I don't mean to take out my frustration on you.  You've been a great help to me, and I've let you down.
But you did -- I just heard it.
What did you find out?
Yes, master.  Are you sure you want to go through with it?
How's everything?
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper.
Well... I'll just finish unpacking.
I know.
I don't understand -- I followed the notes to the letter.
I see what you mean.
No.  Nor to Elizabeth.
Yes, I will.
Food!!
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
I thought it might be more effective to find someone who speaks Zulu.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
